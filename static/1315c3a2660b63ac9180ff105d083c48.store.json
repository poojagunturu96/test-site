Middlebury students, student organizations, individual faculty and staff who wish to request space for an Event are required to submit a request to reserve space at least three (3) weeks prior to the proposed date.

The initial safety review will flag space requests for events for which there is a reasonable concern that they will be subject to disruption, threats, violence, acts of intimidation, draw unusually large crowds or otherwise indicate that additional planning is necessary to protect the safety and security of the Middlebury community.\n9.  Space may be held but not be finally confirmed for requests that have been flagged for safety review until the review is completed.\n10.

Information Technology","body":"\nInformation technology is vital to the mission and function of Middlebury; our networks and central computing facilities are common resources upon which the whole community depends. Middlebury establishes policies governing its information technology equipment, networks, services, and systems that bind all students, faculty, staff as well as any other users of IT systems or services.  The policies described briefly in this overview are those most likely to impact most members of the Middlebury community; more detailed information about these and other policies can be found at the [ITS website](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/information-technology-services/policies)[](///C:/Users/mcdurfee/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/R7Z1LC5T/Draft%20Middlebury%20assets%20handbook%20section%209.6.17%20CLEAN.docx#_msocom_1)<span>.</span>\n\n### **1.  Responsible Use of Computing and Network Services and Facilities**\n\nResponsible citizenship in the Middlebury community obliges users of computer and network facilities to use them responsibly and ethically, with awareness of the impacts of one's actions on others, and respect for the rights of others. While technology makes available new educational, social, and recreational possibilities, we must recognize that the ethical and legal issues relating to technology are similar to those in our daily lives.\n\nITS actively monitors computers and networks to identify and block malicious activities. We expect all members of our community to behave in a proper and responsible manner. However, if certain malicious, illegal, or inappropriate activities are identified, we are obligated to investigate and act, including cooperating with legal authorities, if necessary. _(See_ [Network Monitoring](https://go.middlebury.edu/netmon) _&_ [Technology Incident Response](https://go.middlebury.edu/tirp) _policies for further details.)_\n\nMiddlebury has implemented network security devices to protect its data, systems, and reputation. While not intended to disallow legitimate traffic to and from the Internet, there may be situations where a specific application fails due to security controls. If you have legitimate need for specific network activities, contact ITS so that your request may be considered.\n\n**a. Responsible use** of our computing resources and network infrastructure comprises three main themes: (a) ethical and law-abiding behavior, (b) conservation of our common resources, and, (c) respect for others.\n\n_**i. Ethical and Law-Abiding Behavior:**_ Inappropriate actions using computers can involve violation of the law, with resulting prosecution and criminal penalties. Theft, plagiarism, \"breaking and entering,\" fraud, invasions of privacy, harassment, or distribution of illegal material are just as serious when committed with a computer as by any other means.\n\nTheft includes the unauthorized copying of copyrighted software, reproduction or distribution of copyrighted music or video recordings without the purchase of legal copies or the explicit permission of the artist or publisher (including downloading and sharing music via popular peer-to-peer systems), and other forms of copyright violation. Unauthorized use and/or distribution of others' intellectual property (including, but not limited to, copyrighted text, images, sound, and software) violates federal or state laws or regulations and can result in civil or criminal penalties, even if the material is distributed for free, with no monetary gain to the distributor (the student, faculty, or staff member). Middlebury intends to comply fully with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.\n\n**An example: Sharing Music & Videos**\n\nMany members of the Middlebury community have questions about the sharing of music and movies in digital format over the Internet. File sharing may violate U.S. copyright law and subject you to a lawsuit for copyright infringement, and it may also be a violation of Middlebury policy.  You should understand the risks of certain types file sharing given potential legal action. **Most commercially produced music, movies, games and software are copyrighted and are not to be freely shared without permission. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">This is the law</span>**. Members of our community must follow the policies for appropriate use of technology resources under the law as described on the [ITS website](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/information-technology-services/policies). _see:_ [Responsible Use of Computing and Network Service and Facilities](https://go.middlebury.edu/itsru); [Network Policies](https://go.middlebury.edu/netpolicies).\n\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Sources for legal downloading may be found at:</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.educause.edu/legalcontent\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>www.educause.edu/legalcontent </strong></a></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://whymusicmatters.com/find-music\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>RIAA's Music Matters list of legal music sites</strong></a></p>\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)</span> specifies procedures that Middlebury must follow when notified that an individual using our network is violating copyright laws. If the copyright holder contacts Middlebury about a violation, if we are able to trace the network address for the alleged time of violation, we notify the user of that network address, and require removal of the offending material from the computer. For repeated notifications, we block network access from the identified network address.\n\n\"Break and enter\" includes unauthorized attempts to gain access or circumvent security features of computer systems or networks. Access to our systems/servers, networks, and any information contained on them or transported by them is for authorized users only.\n\nFraud includes misrepresenting yourself or falsifying your identity to gain use of computers, sending electronic messages under a false address, and using others' accounts without permission.\n\nViolations of privacy include accessing other people's data or electronic mail, or spying on their communications. Abusive or threatening messages to others can be prosecuted as harassment. Offering illegal material by electronic means can be prosecuted in the same manner as offering illegal material on the street or a conventional market.\n\nShould ITS receive a formal complaint of illegal activity involving a personal computer on our network (for example, a violation of copyright by unauthorized file-sharing under the terms of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act), ITS staff will make every effort to identify and inform the owner of the machine of the problem. The offending machine may be blocked from Internet access until the situation is rectified, in order to stop the alleged illegal activity and/or to try to protect the owner from further liability.\n\n_**ii. Conservation of Our Common Resources:**_ As members of the Middlebury community, we must be aware of the impact that our actions have on others and avoid activities that undermine or damage the integrity and efficient functioning of the network and computing infrastructure. Deliberate interference with the functioning of any computing or communications equipment will be regarded as vandalism and result in quick and decisive action.\n\nIn addition, we must avoid other actions that impair the performance of the network and computer systems for others. The communications infrastructure is finite, as are all resources. Those who use network bandwidth, CPU utilization, or memory allocation for personal activities, such as games and chain-mail lists, or use programs that digitally distribute music and/or video for personal recreation, etc., hamper the activities of others engaged in educational and scholarly activities that are the priorities of the institution. Improperly or inappropriately configured or malfunctioning personal computers or communications electronic gear may similarly degrade performance.  Many \"home networking\" appliances, such as wireless devices or hubs, can cause serious problems if attached to the network; their use is prohibited without prior approval from ITS.\n\nIndividuals should maintain their computers with up-to-date operating system patches and virus protection to avoid contracting and spreading computer viruses or other malicious software. Malfunctioning, misconfigured, or infected machines whose behavior or traffic is significantly degrading performance of the network may be blocked from network access until the problem can be rectified. ITS also may prioritize traffic to ensure optimum performance of mission-critical applications.\n\n_**iii.Respect for Others:**_ As citizens in our community, we must respect the rights and privacy of one another. We are obliged to avoid actions that create a public nuisance, such as inappropriate postings to social media sites, mailing lists, or unwarranted mass mailings. The same standards of civilized discourse and etiquette that govern our face-to-face interactions should apply in cyberspace. All users of our computing and networking facilities bear the responsibility to avoid libel, obscenity, undocumented allegations, attacks on personal integrity, and harassment.\n\n**b.** ITS is committed to **responsible behavior** in its management and maintenance of the computing and communications systems.\n\n_**i. Information Technology Services (ITS) respects the privacy and confidentiality of users' files and messages**. (See the \"4\\. Privacy and Security within Middlebury's Systems\" section below for further details)_\n\n_**ii. ITS endeavors to protect users from the unauthorized activities**_ of others and will educate users about how they can protect themselves from breaches of their privacy or the security of their computers.\n\n_**iii. ITS strives to maintain the systems and networks in optimal performance**_ for the good of the community and will address and correct situations that impair their efficient functioning or hamper users' appropriate activities.\n\nWe all must recognize that our actions as network-linked computer users have consequences. Users whose activities or malfunctioning equipment undermine the performance of common resources may be disconnected from the network or denied access to central systems until the problem is corrected. Irresponsible or unethical activities may result in penalties or the loss of privileges. Additionally, deliberate abuse or activities in violation of ITS' rules and regulations may result in penalties consistent with Middlebury's judicial procedures and policies. Users should be aware that activities that may seem benign to them (like sharing pirated music recordings) or harmless pranks (like gaining unauthorized access to remote computers) are increasingly being aggressively prosecuted and litigated by the wronged parties.\n\nThe laws and policies governing acceptable use of computer networks and the Internet are rapidly evolving; pending legislation and court cases may have major impacts. Users who have specific questions about responsible and acceptable use are encouraged to seek guidance from ITS.\n\n### **2\\. E-mail Policies**\n\nE-mail is the official method for communicating with Middlebury students, faculty, and staff. Official e-mail communications are intended to meet and serve academic and administrative needs. Middlebury expects that such communications, many of which are time-critical, will be received and read in a timely fashion. To enable this process, all students, faculty, and staff are issued a standardized Middlebury e-mail account.  Students, faculty, and staff who choose to forward e-mail from their Middlebury e-mail accounts are responsible for ensuring that all information, including attachments, is transmitted in its entirety to the preferred account. <span>Individual or institutional email accounts may not be used for direct advertising for personal profit or gain.</span>\n\nMiddlebury has adopted guidelines for appropriate use of All Campus Email messages and such messages may only be sent by specific authorized individuals. More information is available [here](https://go.middlebury.edu/policy-email).\n\n#### **3. Network Monitoring Policy**\n\n**a. Purpose**  \nThe primary purpose of network monitoring is to ensure the availability, performance and security of Middlebury’s network services. This includes identifying and blocking malicious activity in order to protect the College’s data, systems, and reputation.\n\n**b. Scope**  \nThe scope includes all computing systems and network infrastructure owned or managed by Middlebury.\n\n**c. Policy**  \nIn order to protect data, designated ITS staff may use network monitoring technologies to log network activity and to scan data moving across the network. These technologies may include anti-virus software, firewalls, intrusion protection and intrusion detection systems, vulnerability management systems, and database and application monitoring systems. This information may be centrally correlated for analysis.\n\nServer logs may be monitored for malicious activity on a routine schedule. Other network traffic may be logged as necessary for troubleshooting and resolution of network issues. Automated scans for unencrypted sensitive data are conducted with findings logged for appropriate management or removal.\n\nDuring emergencies (brief and/or prolonged) Middlebury’s network monitoring capabilities may be leveraged to determine the location of connected devices, in accordance with (and subject to) Middlebury handbook standards for privacy. These measures will not ordinarily be utilized to monitor an individual’s location or movements in real-time.\n\nConfidentiality of all information gathered as a result of network monitoring will be maintained at all times. Access to information obtained through network monitoring will be limited to designated staff and in the event of an investigation, College officials, legal counsel, or law enforcement. This information will be kept in a protected storage area. Events and incidents identified through network security monitoring will be managed in the spirit of the Technology Incident Response Policy.\n\nAny substantive changes to the network monitoring methodology or scope must be approved by the College’s senior management.\n\n**d. Non-Compliance**  \nAny employee who is found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Violation of this policy may also be a violation of the Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\n### **4\\. Privacy and Security within Middlebury’s Systems**\n\n**a. Overview**\n\nHandling confidential and private information appropriately is a core Middlebury value, consistent with our commitment to a workplace and academic community founded on trust and respectful behavior.  However, Middlebury information systems and computing resources exist to support the non-profit academic and administrative activities of the institution, and Middlebury has compelling institutional interests, such as managing its information systems and networks in compliance with the law and protecting the safety of members of our community, that are balanced against an individual’s interest in privacy of information stored on Middlebury devices or within Middlebury networks.  This Policy articulates the way those interests are balanced and the procedural mechanisms to safeguard information.\n\nPlease note that documents addressing the fluid issue of technology can rarely be exhaustive or dictate outcomes in all circumstances, but this Policy articulates fundamental expectations for all members of the Middlebury community and principles that underlie decision-making in these areas.   All users are also expected to conduct themselves in accordance with Middlebury’s policy on [Responsible Use of Computing and Network Services and Facilities](https://go.middlebury.edu/itsru).\n\n**b. Scope of this Policy**\n\nThis Policy applies to all participants in all of Middlebury’s programs, including students, faculty and staff, as well as any others who may regularly or incidentally use any of Middlebury’s information systems, devices and/or networks.\n\n**c. Definitions**\n\n“User electronic information” includes, but is not limited to, emails, voice mails, and text messages, and their associated metadata, that are located in files and accounts associated with a particular user, as well as information generated by automated processes triggered by that user’s use of Middlebury systems.\n\n**d. Policy**\n\n1.  Use of Middlebury Devices, Systems and Networks\n    1.  Middlebury provides devices, IT systems and networks for institutional purposes to support its teaching and learning mission.\n    2.  Incidental personal use of the Middlebury email system as well as for data storage on Middlebury file servers such as MiddFiles is permitted but not encouraged.\n    3.  Individuals bear the responsibility to avoid libel, obscenity, undocumented allegations, attacks on personal integrity, and acts of harassment.  Please see Middlebury’s policy on “[Responsible Use of Computing and Network Services and Facilities](https://go.middlebury.edu/itsru)” for additional information regarding expectations of your use of Middlebury computing resources.\n    4.  Unencrypted personally identifiable information (individual names associated with driver's license, social security, credit card or bank account numbers and access codes) and other confidential information related to Middlebury activities must not be stored on individual faculty, staff, or student employee computers, or personally-owned devices. Employees must not reconfigure a Middlebury-supplied laptop and personal computer to bypass the prompt for an authorized Middlebury username and password upon start-up: passwords must be keyed in, rather than set to be entered automatically. Loss or theft of any device (including a laptop, personal computer, tablet, or smartphone) that may contain institutional data must be immediately reported to ITS.  \n        _see also,_ **_Banner Security Procedures_** _for additional policies & practices related to data integrity and stewardship._\n2.  Monitoring\n    1.  ITS is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information stored in Middlebury devices, networks and systems.  Middlebury uses a variety of automatic mechanisms to monitor its networks and systems at the aggregate, institutional level, and follows best practices to identify and diagnose system or security vulnerabilities and problems.\n    2.  Middlebury does not routinely monitor the activity and accounts of individual users except under certain circumstances described in this Policy.\n    3.  ITS may monitor and/or access electronic information when necessary to address system or security vulnerabilities and problems, or to otherwise preserve the integrity of Middlebury systems.  This includes but is not limited to ongoing maintenance, inspection, protecting against threats such as attacks, malware, and viruses; to protect the institution; and to ensure the integrity, security and availability of information in compliance with the law, contractual obligations, etc. Routine network monitoring may also include anti-virus software, firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention, vulnerability management systems, and database and application monitoring systems.  Middlebury must also ensure that essential operations can be maintained, which may include disaster recovery preparation, access to restricted data necessary for business purposes and other exceptional steps to ensure continued operations.\n    4.  By choosing to attach privately-owned personal computers or other resources to Middlebury’s networks and systems, users consent to Middlebury’s monitoring activities under this Policy.\n    5.  No independent authorization is required for information technology personnel to conduct routine system protection, maintenance, management or business continuity activities as outlined above.\n\n3\\.   Access\n\n- 1.  a. As a general matter, Middlebury does not guarantee the confidentiality of any content housed within or transmitted through its systems or networks, because in certain circumstances Middlebury may need to access information for legitimate institutional purposes, an illustrative but not exhaustive list of which are described below.\n\ni.    Health and Safety Matters:  In situations where the safety of any human being is seriously threatened, Middlebury reserves the right to access information to reduce the health and safety risk.\n\nii.    As Required By Law: Middlebury must comply with legal process, including lawful demands for information in government investigations, law enforcement proceedings, etc. and it has obligations to preserve and produce information that is required in connection with threatened or pending litigation.  Subpoenas, court orders, or other demands for information should be directed to the Office of the General Counsel.\n\niii.    Institutional Investigations of Illegal Behavior or Misconduct:  Under its policies, Middlebury may and often is required to gather information to investigate a possible violation of law or a breach of Middlebury policy.  Access under such circumstances is restricted under the associated Procedure for Authorization, which ensures that appropriate senior leadership, such as the Vice-President for Human Resources, or the Dean of the Faculty, is informed in order to authorize access.  Senior leaders may consult with the General Counsel, as needed.\n\niv.    Operational Necessity: Middlebury may access information necessary to carry out essential business functions, which may include circumstances of unexpected absence, death or other unavailability.\n\n4\\. Authorization Procedures\n\nA. Investigations: Other than in an emergency, access to identifiable electronic information in connection with an investigation must be authorized by the responsible senior leader in advance, or be pursuant to the user’s consent.  Senior leaders responsible for approving uses for such purposes are:\n\n1.  The Vice President for Human Resources for all staff\n2.  The Dean of the Faculty for College faculty\n3.  The Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of the College for College students\n4.  The Vice President of Advancement for alumni, parents and friends\n5.  The VPAA/Dean of the Institute for MIIS faculty\n6.  The Executive Director of Enrollment, Advising & Student Services for MIIS students\n7.  The VPAA/Dean of the Schools for faculty or students of the Schools\n\nITS will notify the senior leader about a pending need for authorization.  The senior leader is responsible for weighing the needs of Middlebury against the privacy interests of the individual, in the context of applicable legal restrictions, and may take into consideration technological tools utilizing non-consumptive or data analytical techniques.  Senior leaders may consult with the General Counsel and others as needed.  Information provided under this exception will be limited to the information that is necessary to effectuate the institution’s purpose and must be maintained as confidential to the maximum extent possible.\n\n<span>B.  Emergencies: Emergency access to information needed to reduce a serious threat to a person’s health or safety may be authorized by an appropriate member of the Senior Leadership Group, who is responsible for notifying appropriate offices after the emergency has resolved of the actions taken.  Notice will ordinarily be given to an identified user within a reasonable period of time, although Middlebury may exercise discretion in such notifications.</span>\n\nQuestions about this policy and its application should be directed to the Assistant Vice President for ITS and/or the Executive Vice President for Finance and Administration, or the General Counsel.\n\n### **5\\. Website Policies**\n\nMiddlebury’s websites are overseen by the Office of Communications and Marketing in collaboration with Information and Technology Services. Department web editors who receive training are authorized to make edits, updates and other changes to unrestricted pages. Editing of some pages will be restricted to the Office of Communications and Marketing or other authorized editors.\n\nAll institutional and departmental information should reside on the Middlebury website using the middlebury.edu domain to ensure that the pages comply with Middlebury’s brand and style guidelines as well as the institution’s intellectual property and copyright policies.\n\nMaterials and information created and posted on the Middlebury website are the intellectual property of the institution and/or its employees as provided in Middlebury’s Intellectual Property Policy.\n\nFaculty, staff, and students may create personal, group, and curricular websites and blogs outside the Middlebury website environment in keeping with institutional guidelines.  Use of the Middlebury domain for personal websites is a privilege and is subject to restrictions to protect the institution’s legal status, avoid confusion, and reduce risks to the institution.  Abuse of the privilege may result in an individual’s ability to make such uses being terminated.\n\n**_a. Requirements for All Web Pages_**\n\na.i. Materials and information created and posted on the Middlebury website must comply with copyright and fair use laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 and all relevant institutional policies, including those governing use of computing resources, nondiscrimination, harassment, use of Middlebury facilities and services for commercial purposes, and student and employee conduct.\n\na.ii. Any use of the Middlebury website for illegal or inappropriate activities or harassment is prohibited. Illegal activities shall be defined as a violation of local, state, and/or federal laws. Inappropriate use shall be defined as a violation of the intended use of the Middlebury’s computing resources and policies, and/or the purpose and goals of the Middlebury website. Harassment is defined and addressed in the Middlebury [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin) Statement found in the Middlebury Handbook.\n\na.iii.

Middlebury establishes policies governing its information technology equipment, networks, services, and systems that bind all students, faculty, staff as well as any other users of IT systems or services.  The policies described briefly in this overview are those most likely to impact most members of the Middlebury community; more detailed information about these and other policies can be found at the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/office/information-technology-services/policies\">ITS website</a><a href=\"///C:/Users/mcdurfee/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/R7Z1LC5T/Draft%20Middlebury%20assets%20handbook%20section%209.6.17%20CLEAN.docx#_msocom_1\"></a><span>.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>1.  Responsible Use of Computing and Network Services and Facilities</strong></h3>\n<p>Responsible citizenship in the Middlebury community obliges users of computer and network facilities to use them responsibly and ethically, with awareness of the impacts of one's actions on others, and respect for the rights of others. While technology makes available new educational, social, and recreational possibilities, we must recognize that the ethical and legal issues relating to technology are similar to those in our daily lives.</p>\n<p>ITS actively monitors computers and networks to identify and block malicious activities. We expect all members of our community to behave in a proper and responsible manner. However, if certain malicious, illegal, or inappropriate activities are identified, we are obligated to investigate and act, including cooperating with legal authorities, if necessary. <em>(See</em> <a href=\"https://go.middlebury.edu/netmon\">Network Monitoring</a> <em>&#x26;</em> <a href=\"https://go.middlebury.edu/tirp\">Technology Incident Response</a> <em>policies for further details.)</em></p>\n<p>Middlebury has implemented network security devices to protect its data, systems, and reputation. While not intended to disallow legitimate traffic to and from the Internet, there may be situations where a specific application fails due to security controls. If you have legitimate need for specific network activities, contact ITS so that your request may be considered.</p>\n<p><strong>a. Responsible use</strong> of our computing resources and network infrastructure comprises three main themes: (a) ethical and law-abiding behavior, (b) conservation of our common resources, and, (c) respect for others.</p>\n<p><em><strong>i. Ethical and Law-Abiding Behavior:</strong></em> Inappropriate actions using computers can involve violation of the law, with resulting prosecution and criminal penalties. Theft, plagiarism, \"breaking and entering,\" fraud, invasions of privacy, harassment, or distribution of illegal material are just as serious when committed with a computer as by any other means.</p>\n<p>Theft includes the unauthorized copying of copyrighted software, reproduction or distribution of copyrighted music or video recordings without the purchase of legal copies or the explicit permission of the artist or publisher (including downloading and sharing music via popular peer-to-peer systems), and other forms of copyright violation. Unauthorized use and/or distribution of others' intellectual property (including, but not limited to, copyrighted text, images, sound, and software) violates federal or state laws or regulations and can result in civil or criminal penalties, even if the material is distributed for free, with no monetary gain to the distributor (the student, faculty, or staff member). Middlebury intends to comply fully with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.</p>\n<p><strong>An example: Sharing Music &#x26; Videos</strong></p>\n<p>Many members of the Middlebury community have questions about the sharing of music and movies in digital format over the Internet. File sharing may violate U.S. copyright law and subject you to a lawsuit for copyright infringement, and it may also be a violation of Middlebury policy.  You should understand the risks of certain types file sharing given potential legal action. <strong>Most commercially produced music, movies, games and software are copyrighted and are not to be freely shared without permission. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">This is the law</span></strong>. Members of our community must follow the policies for appropriate use of technology resources under the law as described on the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/office/information-technology-services/policies\">ITS website</a>. <em>see:</em> <a href=\"https://go.middlebury.edu/itsru\">Responsible Use of Computing and Network Service and Facilities</a>; <a href=\"https://go.middlebury.edu/netpolicies\">Network Policies</a>.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Sources for legal downloading may be found at:</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.educause.edu/legalcontent\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>www.educause.edu/legalcontent </strong></a></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://whymusicmatters.com/find-music\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>RIAA's Music Matters list of legal music sites</strong></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)</span> specifies procedures that Middlebury must follow when notified that an individual using our network is violating copyright laws. If the copyright holder contacts Middlebury about a violation, if we are able to trace the network address for the alleged time of violation, we notify the user of that network address, and require removal of the offending material from the computer. For repeated notifications, we block network access from the identified network address.</p>\n<p>\"Break and enter\" includes unauthorized attempts to gain access or circumvent security features of computer systems or networks. Access to our systems/servers, networks, and any information contained on them or transported by them is for authorized users only.</p>\n<p>Fraud includes misrepresenting yourself or falsifying your identity to gain use of computers, sending electronic messages under a false address, and using others' accounts without permission.</p>\n<p>Violations of privacy include accessing other people's data or electronic mail, or spying on their communications.

Scope of this Policy</strong></p>\n<p>This Policy applies to all participants in all of Middlebury’s programs, including students, faculty and staff, as well as any others who may regularly or incidentally use any of Middlebury’s information systems, devices and/or networks.</p>\n<p><strong>c. Definitions</strong></p>\n<p>“User electronic information” includes, but is not limited to, emails, voice mails, and text messages, and their associated metadata, that are located in files and accounts associated with a particular user, as well as information generated by automated processes triggered by that user’s use of Middlebury systems.</p>\n<p><strong>d. Policy</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use of Middlebury Devices, Systems and Networks\n<ol>\n<li>Middlebury provides devices, IT systems and networks for institutional purposes to support its teaching and learning mission.</li>\n<li>Incidental personal use of the Middlebury email system as well as for data storage on Middlebury file servers such as MiddFiles is permitted but not encouraged.</li>\n<li>Individuals bear the responsibility to avoid libel, obscenity, undocumented allegations, attacks on personal integrity, and acts of harassment.  Please see Middlebury’s policy on “<a href=\"https://go.middlebury.edu/itsru\">Responsible Use of Computing and Network Services and Facilities</a>” for additional information regarding expectations of your use of Middlebury computing resources.</li>\n<li>Unencrypted personally identifiable information (individual names associated with driver's license, social security, credit card or bank account numbers and access codes) and other confidential information related to Middlebury activities must not be stored on individual faculty, staff, or student employee computers, or personally-owned devices. Employees must not reconfigure a Middlebury-supplied laptop and personal computer to bypass the prompt for an authorized Middlebury username and password upon start-up: passwords must be keyed in, rather than set to be entered automatically. Loss or theft of any device (including a laptop, personal computer, tablet, or smartphone) that may contain institutional data must be immediately reported to ITS.<br>\n<em>see also,</em> <strong><em>Banner Security Procedures</em></strong> <em>for additional policies &#x26; practices related to data integrity and stewardship.</em></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Monitoring\n<ol>\n<li>ITS is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information stored in Middlebury devices, networks and systems.  Middlebury uses a variety of automatic mechanisms to monitor its networks and systems at the aggregate, institutional level, and follows best practices to identify and diagnose system or security vulnerabilities and problems.</li>\n<li>Middlebury does not routinely monitor the activity and accounts of individual users except under certain circumstances described in this Policy.</li>\n<li>ITS may monitor and/or access electronic information when necessary to address system or security vulnerabilities and problems, or to otherwise preserve the integrity of Middlebury systems.  This includes but is not limited to ongoing maintenance, inspection, protecting against threats such as attacks, malware, and viruses; to protect the institution; and to ensure the integrity, security and availability of information in compliance with the law, contractual obligations, etc. Routine network monitoring may also include anti-virus software, firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention, vulnerability management systems, and database and application monitoring systems.  Middlebury must also ensure that essential operations can be maintained, which may include disaster recovery preparation, access to restricted data necessary for business purposes and other exceptional steps to ensure continued operations.</li>\n<li>By choosing to attach privately-owned personal computers or other resources to Middlebury’s networks and systems, users consent to Middlebury’s monitoring activities under this Policy.</li>\n<li>No independent authorization is required for information technology personnel to conduct routine system protection, maintenance, management or business continuity activities as outlined above.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>3.   Access</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>a. As a general matter, Middlebury does not guarantee the confidentiality of any content housed within or transmitted through its systems or networks, because in certain circumstances Middlebury may need to access information for legitimate institutional purposes, an illustrative but not exhaustive list of which are described below.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>i.    Health and Safety Matters:  In situations where the safety of any human being is seriously threatened, Middlebury reserves the right to access information to reduce the health and safety risk.</p>\n<p>ii.    As Required By Law: Middlebury must comply with legal process, including lawful demands for information in government investigations, law enforcement proceedings, etc. and it has obligations to preserve and produce information that is required in connection with threatened or pending litigation.  Subpoenas, court orders, or other demands for information should be directed to the Office of the General Counsel.</p>\n<p>iii.    Institutional Investigations of Illegal Behavior or Misconduct:  Under its policies, Middlebury may and often is required to gather information to investigate a possible violation of law or a breach of Middlebury policy.  Access under such circumstances is restricted under the associated Procedure for Authorization, which ensures that appropriate senior leadership, such as the Vice-President for Human Resources, or the Dean of the Faculty, is informed in order to authorize access.  Senior leaders may consult with the General Counsel, as needed.</p>\n<p>iv.    Operational Necessity: Middlebury may access information necessary to carry out essential business functions, which may include circumstances of unexpected absence, death or other unavailability.</p>\n<p>4. Authorization Procedures</p>\n<p>A. Investigations: Other than in an emergency, access to identifiable electronic information in connection with an investigation must be authorized by the responsible senior leader in advance, or be pursuant to the user’s consent.  Senior leaders responsible for approving uses for such purposes are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Vice President for Human Resources for all staff</li>\n<li>The Dean of the Faculty for College faculty</li>\n<li>The Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of the College for College students</li>\n<li>The Vice President of Advancement for alumni, parents and friends</li>\n<li>The VPAA/Dean of the Institute for MIIS faculty</li>\n<li>The Executive Director of Enrollment, Advising &#x26; Student Services for MIIS students</li>\n<li>The VPAA/Dean of the Schools for faculty or students of the Schools</li>\n</ol>\n<p>ITS will notify the senior leader about a pending need for authorization.  The senior leader is responsible for weighing the needs of Middlebury against the privacy interests of the individual, in the context of applicable legal restrictions, and may take into consideration technological tools utilizing non-consumptive or data analytical techniques.  Senior leaders may consult with the General Counsel and others as needed.  Information provided under this exception will be limited to the information that is necessary to effectuate the institution’s purpose and must be maintained as confidential to the maximum extent possible.</p>\n<p><span>B.  Emergencies: Emergency access to information needed to reduce a serious threat to a person’s health or safety may be authorized by an appropriate member of the Senior Leadership Group, who is responsible for notifying appropriate offices after the emergency has resolved of the actions taken.  Notice will ordinarily be given to an identified user within a reasonable period of time, although Middlebury may exercise discretion in such notifications.</span></p>\n<p>Questions about this policy and its application should be directed to the Assistant Vice President for ITS and/or the Executive Vice President for Finance and Administration, or the General Counsel.</p>\n<h3><strong>5.

As stated in the Middlebury <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin\">Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy</a> Statement, Middlebury recognizes that the protection of free and open speech and the open exchange of ideas are essential to any academic or artistic community and crucial for the activity of scholars and artists. Free, honest intellectual inquiry, debate, and constructive dialogue are vital to the academic mission of the institution and must be protected, even when the views expressed are unpopular or controversial.</p>\n<p>b.i. Middlebury also recognizes that contents of electronic publications or electronic communications can be used specifically to intimidate or coerce and to inhibit genuine discourse, free inquiry, and learning. Such abuses are unacceptable.

Principles and Definitions**\n\nThe purpose of this Intellectual Property policy (this “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">policy</span>”) is to protect and celebrate the work of members of the Middlebury Community, to establish understood guidelines with respect to ownership and use of Intellectual Property, and to demonstrate Middlebury’s commitment to sharing the Middlebury Community’s expertise for the public good. This policy outlines the rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of Middlebury Community members with regard to Intellectual Property created as part of work or study with Middlebury or with the use of Middlebury resources.\n\n**_(a)  Principles._**\n\n(1) Middlebury wishes to support and sustain its tradition of rigorous academic pursuit leading to the creation, dissemination, and preservation of knowledge, inventions and scholarly works for the benefit of the Middlebury Community and the world. Middlebury approaches Intellectual Property in a way that recognizes and honors the traditions of how institutions of higher education support scholarly work, and creates incentives to do such work, while ensuring that it is preserving the appropriate Intellectual Property rights Middlebury needs to function in an evolving world. Consistent with this academic tradition, Middlebury’s Intellectual Property policy affirms that ownership of scholarly work created by members of the Middlebury Community typically remains with the creator of such work.\n\n(2) An important way for Middlebury to encourage scholarly work and innovations is to provide institutional support in the development, production and dissemination of creative works. Academic freedom includes the freedom to choose what work to carry out and how to disseminate the results. Middlebury’s approach to Intellectual Property is intended to promote academic freedom and the broad dissemination of scholarly work and innovations.\n\n(3) Middlebury does not distinguish between creative and scholarly works created by faculty, staff, or students. All members of the Middlebury Community are treated equally under this policy, though some kinds of work done by Middlebury Community members may fall under designations of specific interest for Middlebury and thus be subject to different Middlebury ownership guidelines.\n\n**_(b)  Definitions._**\n\nFor purposes of this policy, the following terms have the following meanings:\n\n(1) “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Middlebury</span>” means all educational and research programs owned or governed by or on behalf of the President and Fellows of Middlebury College, in existence today or formed or acquired in the future, including Middlebury College, Middlebury Language Schools, Middlebury C.V. Starr Schools Abroad, Middlebury Bread Loaf School of English, Middlebury Bread Loaf Writers’ Conferences, Middlebury School of the Environment, and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.\n\n(2) “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Intellectual Property</span>” and “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">IP</span>” mean intellectual property existing anywhere in the world, including rights in, to, and arising under (i) patents, patent applications and inventions (“<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Patent Rights</span>”), (ii) trademarks, service marks, trade dress, domain names, uniform resource locators (URLs) and other network or electronic designations or social media identifiers (together with the goodwill associated therewith), (iii) works of authorship, including copyrights, (iv) computer software (in object code or source code format) and related files, libraries, data and other information, and (v) trade secrets and other confidential information.\n\n(3) “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">creator</span>” means any person covered by this policy who (i) creates a work of authorship qualifying for protection under applicable copyright law, (ii) individually or jointly with others makes an invention and meets the criteria for inventorship under applicable patent laws and regulations, or (iii) otherwise creates or develops Intellectual Property.\n\n(4) “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Middlebury Community</span>” refers to (i) all Middlebury faculty, including full-time, part-time, visiting, and affiliated faculty of Middlebury, (ii) all Middlebury staff, including full-time and part-time staff and administrators of Middlebury, and (iii) all Middlebury students.\n\n**II. Determination of Intellectual Property Ownership**\n\n**_(a)  General Rule._**\n\n**Subject to applicable law, any IP created or developed by members of the Middlebury Community shall be owned by the creators of such IP.**\n\n**_(b)  Exceptions to General Rule._**\n\nNotwithstanding subsection (a) above, Middlebury shall own such IP, and the creator(s) hereby assign, and shall assign, all IP rights to Middlebury, when:\n\n(1) Middlebury has an _identity_ or _functional interest_ in the IP.\n\nFor the purposes of this policy, _identity interest_ is defined as an interest in IP that is more integral to, and reflects more directly on, the identity of Middlebury than on the identity of the individuals who create it. For the purposes of this policy, _functional interest_ is defined as an interest in IP that is used or intended to be used to ensure the effective functioning, coordination and management of ongoing operations of Middlebury. For example:\n\n(A) Middlebury has an _identity interest_ in works related to Middlebury’s identity, including, without limitation:\n\n- publications disseminated beyond Middlebury, including brochures, videos, web sites and other materials designed for the recruitment of students;\n- official institutional web pages;\n- multi-media elements of Middlebury’s official online and social media presence;\n- alumni affairs publications;\n- materials designed for fundraising and institutional advancement; and\n- Middlebury logos, trademarks, service marks, domain names and social media identifiers.\n\n(B) Middlebury has a _functional interest_ in works related to ongoing operations, including, without limitation:\n\n- administrative and personnel handbooks, policy manuals and other documents;\n- training and procedural manuals;\n- committee and task force reports;\n- institutional proposals for external funding;\n- self-studies for external review or re-accreditation processes;\n- institutional planning documents;\n- software, digital learning platforms, interfaces, databases, specialized processes and other innovations used for operational purposes; and\n- maps, architectural drawings, technical and engineering documents and other information relating to Middlebury facilities, properties and assets.\n\n(2) Such IP is created or developed in connection with a specific, institutionally-defined project.\n\n(3) Creation or development of the IP was funded as part of an externally sponsored program under an agreement that _requires_ that IP ownership rights be allocated to Middlebury or to another entity specified by the funder. If, under the legal requirements applicable to a government-funded project (e.g., the Bayh-Dole Act), the relevant government agency may approve the transfer of the IP rights, subject to any rights of the agency under the applicable law or otherwise, Middlebury will inform the agency that it seeks to release its rights and will cooperate with the creators to obtain agency approval to transfer IP rights to the creators.\n\n(4) The IP was created or developed with substantially greater use of Middlebury resources than would normally be provided in support of the creators’ employment duties or student activities, as applicable. This might occur through disproportionate use of staff time, student resources, networks, equipment, direct funding, or other Middlebury resources. If in such a situation the creator and Middlebury mutually agree that ownership should remain with the creator or be shared by Middlebury and the creator, then Middlebury and the creator must enter into a written agreement regarding ownership of the IP at an early stage of its development, generally before the use of extra Middlebury resources begins, and ownership will then be determined by the terms of such agreement (as further described below).\n\n**_(c)  IP Ownership Agreements._**\n\nNotwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) above, where Middlebury and the creator of the IP have entered into a written agreement regarding the ownership of the IP, ownership and any assignment of IP rights obligations will then be determined by the terms of such agreement. Such agreements may involve the offering of non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licenses for use by the creator or Middlebury, and/or the offering of creative commons licensing for broader use.\n\n**_(d)  Other Middlebury Policies._**\n\nThough ownership of instructional and scholarly materials and other IP created or developed by the Middlebury Community that fall outside of the Middlebury ownership rights described in subsection (b) or (c) above remains with the creator, the rights of those individuals to create, develop, distribute, use and otherwise exploit those materials and other IP remain subject to all other applicable Middlebury policies, including <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Middlebury’s Consulting and Outside Employment policy</span>, Middlebury’s <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Trademark and Logos policy</span>, and policies dealing with conflicts of interest.\n\n**_(e)  IP Created through Partnerships, Collaborations and International Work/Study._**\n\nIntellectual Property may be created or developed through collaborations or partnerships by the Middlebury Community with other individuals and institutions. In those cases, the members of the Middlebury Community and the collaborating individuals or entities should sign an agreement that describes how Intellectual Property ownership and rights will be handled. It is important to recognize that such agreements should be made in advance of the start of a project and that they may be subject to institutional, state, U.S., and international laws and regulations.\n\nMost of the Intellectual Property created or developed by Middlebury Community members as part of work or study with Middlebury Schools Abroad and any Middlebury programs with international collaborators or operations outside the United States, remain as the property of those individuals as described in this policy; however, there are exceptions to this rule, including, without limitation, those instances in which IP is to be owned by Middlebury as described in this policy. Additionally, some exceptions to individual ownership may apply when necessary to comply with applicable, institutional, state, U.S. and international laws and regulations.\n\nMiddlebury Community members studying or working with an international partner institution or an unrelated institution, organization, or entity, should review this policy and the Middlebury Conflict of Interest Policy, and investigate the Intellectual Property policies of that institution, organization, or entity before committing to study or work there, as they may be subject to those policies. Similarly, staff and students from international partner institutions or unrelated institutions, organizations, or entities will be subject to Middlebury’s IP policies when they are doing work as part of a Middlebury course of study or work.\n\n**_(f)    Institutional Support for Commercialization of IP Owned by Middlebury Community Members._**\n\nMiddlebury Community members who wish to pursue the commercialization of their Intellectual Property rights, including Patent Rights, through Middlebury, may provide the Office of the Provost with written notice of such proposed commercialization, which notice shall include a non-confidential description of such Intellectual Property rights.  The Intellectual Property Committee will then determine whether additional information or disclosure is required with respect to such Intellectual Property and, if so, may require the applicable Middlebury Community member to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with Middlebury with respect to such information.  Following the Intellectual Property Committee’s review of the Intellectual Property and additional information and disclosures (if any) and evaluation of the commercial potential of the Intellectual Property, the Intellectual Property Committee will make a recommendation to the Provost regarding Middlebury’s support of and role in the protection and commercialization of the Intellectual Property. Whether Middlebury will provide assistance in the protection and commercialization of such IP will be made at the sole discretion of the Middlebury Provost.  If Middlebury elects to provide assistance in the protection and commercialization of the IP, the owner of the IP rights and Middlebury shall negotiate in good faith an agreement governing the rights and responsibilities to protect the IP rights, to further develop, market and commercialize the IP rights and an equitable sharing of royalties or other financial returns from the IP rights in recognition of their respective contributions and responsibilities.\n\n**_(g)  Questions._**\n\nQuestions regarding the interpretation of the above-described Intellectual Property ownership determination framework should be directed to the [Intellectual Property Committee](https://ipwg.middcreate.net/ip/) as defined in the “Administration” section below.\n\n**III. Middlebury Access and Use**\n\nMiddlebury is committed to sharing the expertise of Middlebury Community members in support of Middlebury’s educational purposes. To do so, Middlebury retains, and the applicable creator(s) hereby grant to Middlebury, a royalty-free and non-exclusive license and right to archive and exhibit innovations that are the Intellectual Property of creators under this policy for long-term preservation and non-commercial uses in support of education and scholarship.\n\n**IV. Administration**\n\n**_(a)  Office of the Provost._**\n\nThis policy will be administered by the Office of the Provost.  Interpretations of and rulings with respect to the terms and conditions of this policy will be made by the Provost, following consultation with the Intellectual Property Committee. Any matters that involve the Provost as a creator under this policy will be determined by an ad hoc committee of the Middlebury Board of Trustees.\n\n**_(b)  Intellectual Property Committee._**\n\nIn implementing this policy, the Middlebury Board of Trustees will, in consultation with the Provost, appoint an Intellectual Property review committee (the “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Intellectual Property Committee</span>”) consisting of members of various constituencies within the Middlebury Community.  The [Intellectual Property Committee](https://ipwg.middcreate.net/ip/) will have an Executive Committee designated by the Board of Trustees.\n\nThe Executive Committee will meet at least semi-annually to discuss and make recommendations to the Provost on matters regarding (i) changes or amendments to this policy, (ii) general guidance to the Middlebury Community regarding the interpretation of, and procedures described in, this policy, and (iii) other issues relating to the matters described in this policy as requested by the President, the Middlebury Board of Trustees or the Provost.  Meetings of the Executive Committee will be open to the Middlebury Community.\n\nThe full Intellectual Property Committee will be convened and meet as needed in response to disputes arising under this policy, and additionally from time to time as requested by the Executive Committee or the Office of the Provost.   Both the Executive and full Intellectual Property Committees will keep regular minutes of meetings and provide such minutes to the Provost.\n\n**_(c)  Resolution of Disputes and Conflicts._**\n\nDisputes relating to this policy and Intellectual Property created or developed by the Middlebury Community will be referred to the full Intellectual Property Committee, the President and the Vice President of Human Resources (collectively, the “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Adjudicating Committee</span>”) for review and resolution.  When addressing a dispute, the Adjudicating Committee shall investigate the dispute, which investigation shall include soliciting feedback and information from the General Counsel of Middlebury, who shall serve as an advocate on behalf of Middlebury (or, in the absence of the General Counsel, an individual appointed by the President to serve as an advocate on behalf of Middlebury) and the creator.  Resolution of all disputes will be made by the Adjudicating Committee, subject to the approval of the President.  The decision of the Adjudicating Committee, subject to the approval of the President, shall be final.\n\n**_(d)  Approval and Modification._**\n\nThis policy has been approved by the Middlebury Board of Trustees.  It may only be modified, restated or repealed with the approval of the Middlebury Board of Trustees.\n","excerpt":"Middlebury is the owner of various forms of intellectual property, including trademarks such as its name, shield, athletic logos and…","html":"<p>Middlebury is the owner of various forms of intellectual property, including trademarks such as its name, shield, athletic logos and copyright in certain documents critical to its identity and operations.</p>\n<p><strong>A.

Starr Schools Abroad, Middlebury Bread Loaf School of English, Middlebury Bread Loaf Writers’ Conferences, Middlebury School of the Environment, and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.</p>\n<p>(2) “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Intellectual Property</span>” and “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">IP</span>” mean intellectual property existing anywhere in the world, including rights in, to, and arising under (i) patents, patent applications and inventions (“<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Patent Rights</span>”), (ii) trademarks, service marks, trade dress, domain names, uniform resource locators (URLs) and other network or electronic designations or social media identifiers (together with the goodwill associated therewith), (iii) works of authorship, including copyrights, (iv) computer software (in object code or source code format) and related files, libraries, data and other information, and (v) trade secrets and other confidential information.</p>\n<p>(3) “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">creator</span>” means any person covered by this policy who (i) creates a work of authorship qualifying for protection under applicable copyright law, (ii) individually or jointly with others makes an invention and meets the criteria for inventorship under applicable patent laws and regulations, or (iii) otherwise creates or develops Intellectual Property.</p>\n<p>(4) “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Middlebury Community</span>” refers to (i) all Middlebury faculty, including full-time, part-time, visiting, and affiliated faculty of Middlebury, (ii) all Middlebury staff, including full-time and part-time staff and administrators of Middlebury, and (iii) all Middlebury students.</p>\n<p><strong>II. Determination of Intellectual Property Ownership</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>(a)  General Rule.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Subject to applicable law, any IP created or developed by members of the Middlebury Community shall be owned by the creators of such IP.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>(b)  Exceptions to General Rule.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, Middlebury shall own such IP, and the creator(s) hereby assign, and shall assign, all IP rights to Middlebury, when:</p>\n<p>(1) Middlebury has an <em>identity</em> or <em>functional interest</em> in the IP.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this policy, <em>identity interest</em> is defined as an interest in IP that is more integral to, and reflects more directly on, the identity of Middlebury than on the identity of the individuals who create it. For the purposes of this policy, <em>functional interest</em> is defined as an interest in IP that is used or intended to be used to ensure the effective functioning, coordination and management of ongoing operations of Middlebury. For example:</p>\n<p>(A) Middlebury has an <em>identity interest</em> in works related to Middlebury’s identity, including, without limitation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>publications disseminated beyond Middlebury, including brochures, videos, web sites and other materials designed for the recruitment of students;</li>\n<li>official institutional web pages;</li>\n<li>multi-media elements of Middlebury’s official online and social media presence;</li>\n<li>alumni affairs publications;</li>\n<li>materials designed for fundraising and institutional advancement; and</li>\n<li>Middlebury logos, trademarks, service marks, domain names and social media identifiers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(B) Middlebury has a <em>functional interest</em> in works related to ongoing operations, including, without limitation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>administrative and personnel handbooks, policy manuals and other documents;</li>\n<li>training and procedural manuals;</li>\n<li>committee and task force reports;</li>\n<li>institutional proposals for external funding;</li>\n<li>self-studies for external review or re-accreditation processes;</li>\n<li>institutional planning documents;</li>\n<li>software, digital learning platforms, interfaces, databases, specialized processes and other innovations used for operational purposes; and</li>\n<li>maps, architectural drawings, technical and engineering documents and other information relating to Middlebury facilities, properties and assets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(2) Such IP is created or developed in connection with a specific, institutionally-defined project.</p>\n<p>(3) Creation or development of the IP was funded as part of an externally sponsored program under an agreement that <em>requires</em> that IP ownership rights be allocated to Middlebury or to another entity specified by the funder. If, under the legal requirements applicable to a government-funded project (e.g., the Bayh-Dole Act), the relevant government agency may approve the transfer of the IP rights, subject to any rights of the agency under the applicable law or otherwise, Middlebury will inform the agency that it seeks to release its rights and will cooperate with the creators to obtain agency approval to transfer IP rights to the creators.</p>\n<p>(4) The IP was created or developed with substantially greater use of Middlebury resources than would normally be provided in support of the creators’ employment duties or student activities, as applicable. This might occur through disproportionate use of staff time, student resources, networks, equipment, direct funding, or other Middlebury resources. If in such a situation the creator and Middlebury mutually agree that ownership should remain with the creator or be shared by Middlebury and the creator, then Middlebury and the creator must enter into a written agreement regarding ownership of the IP at an early stage of its development, generally before the use of extra Middlebury resources begins, and ownership will then be determined by the terms of such agreement (as further described below).</p>\n<p><strong><em>(c)  IP Ownership Agreements.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) above, where Middlebury and the creator of the IP have entered into a written agreement regarding the ownership of the IP, ownership and any assignment of IP rights obligations will then be determined by the terms of such agreement. Such agreements may involve the offering of non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licenses for use by the creator or Middlebury, and/or the offering of creative commons licensing for broader use.</p>\n<p><strong><em>(d)  Other Middlebury Policies.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Though ownership of instructional and scholarly materials and other IP created or developed by the Middlebury Community that fall outside of the Middlebury ownership rights described in subsection (b) or (c) above remains with the creator, the rights of those individuals to create, develop, distribute, use and otherwise exploit those materials and other IP remain subject to all other applicable Middlebury policies, including <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Middlebury’s Consulting and Outside Employment policy</span>, Middlebury’s <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Trademark and Logos policy</span>, and policies dealing with conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p><strong><em>(e)  IP Created through Partnerships, Collaborations and International Work/Study.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Intellectual Property may be created or developed through collaborations or partnerships by the Middlebury Community with other individuals and institutions. In those cases, the members of the Middlebury Community and the collaborating individuals or entities should sign an agreement that describes how Intellectual Property ownership and rights will be handled. It is important to recognize that such agreements should be made in advance of the start of a project and that they may be subject to institutional, state, U.S., and international laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>Most of the Intellectual Property created or developed by Middlebury Community members as part of work or study with Middlebury Schools Abroad and any Middlebury programs with international collaborators or operations outside the United States, remain as the property of those individuals as described in this policy; however, there are exceptions to this rule, including, without limitation, those instances in which IP is to be owned by Middlebury as described in this policy. Additionally, some exceptions to individual ownership may apply when necessary to comply with applicable, institutional, state, U.S. and international laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>Middlebury Community members studying or working with an international partner institution or an unrelated institution, organization, or entity, should review this policy and the Middlebury Conflict of Interest Policy, and investigate the Intellectual Property policies of that institution, organization, or entity before committing to study or work there, as they may be subject to those policies. Similarly, staff and students from international partner institutions or unrelated institutions, organizations, or entities will be subject to Middlebury’s IP policies when they are doing work as part of a Middlebury course of study or work.</p>\n<p><strong><em>(f)    Institutional Support for Commercialization of IP Owned by Middlebury Community Members.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury Community members who wish to pursue the commercialization of their Intellectual Property rights, including Patent Rights, through Middlebury, may provide the Office of the Provost with written notice of such proposed commercialization, which notice shall include a non-confidential description of such Intellectual Property rights.  The Intellectual Property Committee will then determine whether additional information or disclosure is required with respect to such Intellectual Property and, if so, may require the applicable Middlebury Community member to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with Middlebury with respect to such information.  Following the Intellectual Property Committee’s review of the Intellectual Property and additional information and disclosures (if any) and evaluation of the commercial potential of the Intellectual Property, the Intellectual Property Committee will make a recommendation to the Provost regarding Middlebury’s support of and role in the protection and commercialization of the Intellectual Property. Whether Middlebury will provide assistance in the protection and commercialization of such IP will be made at the sole discretion of the Middlebury Provost.  If Middlebury elects to provide assistance in the protection and commercialization of the IP, the owner of the IP rights and Middlebury shall negotiate in good faith an agreement governing the rights and responsibilities to protect the IP rights, to further develop, market and commercialize the IP rights and an equitable sharing of royalties or other financial returns from the IP rights in recognition of their respective contributions and responsibilities.</p>\n<p><strong><em>(g)  Questions.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Questions regarding the interpretation of the above-described Intellectual Property ownership determination framework should be directed to the <a href=\"https://ipwg.middcreate.net/ip/\">Intellectual Property Committee</a> as defined in the “Administration” section below.</p>\n<p><strong>III. Middlebury Access and Use</strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury is committed to sharing the expertise of Middlebury Community members in support of Middlebury’s educational purposes. To do so, Middlebury retains, and the applicable creator(s) hereby grant to Middlebury, a royalty-free and non-exclusive license and right to archive and exhibit innovations that are the Intellectual Property of creators under this policy for long-term preservation and non-commercial uses in support of education and scholarship.</p>\n<p><strong>IV. Administration</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>(a)  Office of the Provost.</em></strong></p>\n<p>This policy will be administered by the Office of the Provost.  Interpretations of and rulings with respect to the terms and conditions of this policy will be made by the Provost, following consultation with the Intellectual Property Committee. Any matters that involve the Provost as a creator under this policy will be determined by an ad hoc committee of the Middlebury Board of Trustees.</p>\n<p><strong><em>(b)  Intellectual Property Committee.</em></strong></p>\n<p>In implementing this policy, the Middlebury Board of Trustees will, in consultation with the Provost, appoint an Intellectual Property review committee (the “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Intellectual Property Committee</span>”) consisting of members of various constituencies within the Middlebury Community.  The <a href=\"https://ipwg.middcreate.net/ip/\">Intellectual Property Committee</a> will have an Executive Committee designated by the Board of Trustees.</p>\n<p>The Executive Committee will meet at least semi-annually to discuss and make recommendations to the Provost on matters regarding (i) changes or amendments to this policy, (ii) general guidance to the Middlebury Community regarding the interpretation of, and procedures described in, this policy, and (iii) other issues relating to the matters described in this policy as requested by the President, the Middlebury Board of Trustees or the Provost.  Meetings of the Executive Committee will be open to the Middlebury Community.</p>\n<p>The full Intellectual Property Committee will be convened and meet as needed in response to disputes arising under this policy, and additionally from time to time as requested by the Executive Committee or the Office of the Provost.   Both the Executive and full Intellectual Property Committees will keep regular minutes of meetings and provide such minutes to the Provost.</p>\n<p><strong><em>(c)  Resolution of Disputes and Conflicts.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Disputes relating to this policy and Intellectual Property created or developed by the Middlebury Community will be referred to the full Intellectual Property Committee, the President and the Vice President of Human Resources (collectively, the “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Adjudicating Committee</span>”) for review and resolution.  When addressing a dispute, the Adjudicating Committee shall investigate the dispute, which investigation shall include soliciting feedback and information from the General Counsel of Middlebury, who shall serve as an advocate on behalf of Middlebury (or, in the absence of the General Counsel, an individual appointed by the President to serve as an advocate on behalf of Middlebury) and the creator.  Resolution of all disputes will be made by the Adjudicating Committee, subject to the approval of the President.  The decision of the Adjudicating Committee, subject to the approval of the President, shall be final.</p>\n<p><strong><em>(d)  Approval and Modification.</em></strong></p>\n<p>This policy has been approved by the Middlebury Board of Trustees.  It may only be modified, restated or repealed with the approval of the Middlebury Board of Trustees.</p>"},"609f029c-496f-500b-9f2c-de21b6b63fe3":{"id":"609f029c-496f-500b-9f2c-de21b6b63fe3","slug":"/pages/i-policies-for-all/appropriate-use/library-resources","title":"D.3.

We are also committed to ensuring that, in accordance with the Drug-Free Schools and Community Act of 1989 and the Drug-Free Schools and Campuses Regulations, our policies concerning alcohol, tobacco and drugs contain clear statements about: (1) the standards of conduct prohibiting the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of tobacco, illegal drugs and alcohol by students and employees; (2) that Middlebury will impose disciplinary sanctions on students and employees who violate these policies (consistent with local, state, and federal law); (3) the applicable legal sanctions under local, state, or federal law for the unlawful possession or distribution of tobacco, illegal drugs and alcohol; and (4) health risks and information regarding tobacco, drug or alcohol counseling, treatment or rehabilitation, or reentry programs that are available to students and employees. When tobacco, drug, or alcohol violations occur, disciplinary sanctions will be imposed in accordance with this policy. Serious incidents that put a student or others at risk of harm, as well as repeated offenses, may require a more vigorous response, including referral to counseling or a treatment facility, a leave of absence, and/or disciplinary outcomes as appropriate.\n\nTherefore, Middlebury will:\n\na. Inform students and employees of federal, state, and local laws, and Middlebury policies, to which they are accountable, and hold them accountable to those policies under Middlebury’s governance;\n\nb. Encourage an environment of enriching extracurricular and social opportunities that includes substance-free events and appropriate venues for students of legal age who choose to drink;\n\nc. Educate members of the community through academic and student life programs and policies about the health risks associated with tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse, and refer students and employees to resources and health services such as tobacco, drug or alcohol counseling, treatment or rehabilitation, or re-entry programs that are available to students and employees, as applicable.\n\n**<a name=\"polices\" id=\"policies\"></a>Middlebury Policies and Local, State, and Federal Law**  \nAll students, faculty, staff, and visitors are subject to local, state, and federal laws, as well as Middlebury tobacco, drug and alcohol policy rules and regulations, while on Middlebury-owned or -leased properties or involved with off-campus activities sponsored by Middlebury or a registered Middlebury organization. Middlebury does not protect students or employees from prosecution for tobacco, drug or alcohol offenses under local, state, or federal laws, and does not interfere with legitimate law enforcement activities. Law enforcement officers may have a legal right to search individuals, and with consent or proper documentation may search property—including residences owned or leased by Middlebury —without prior notice. Middlebury also reserves the right to furnish the police with information regarding alleged illegal activities.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Middlebury College Specific</span>: In order to preserve the safety of our residents, the state of Vermont and the College both adhere to policies that limit disciplinary consequences under certain circumstances when appropriate care is sought for individuals in drug- or alcohol-related distress. Please see the [<span>Medical Amnesty Policy</span>](#amnesty) below for more information. Additionally, if student health and safety concerns resulting from a student’s use of alcohol and/or drugs arise, parents or guardians may be notified. See [Health and Community Responsibility](#health) below for more information.\n\n**<a name=\"alcohol\" id=\"alcohol\"></a>Alcohol**  \nThe following actions are prohibited:\n\na. Underage drinking. Only persons of legal age (21 or older in the United States, and as defined by the laws of a foreign host country) may possess or consume alcoholic beverages. Legal proof of age, such as a valid driver’s license, state-issued liquor identification card, or passport may be required.\n\nb. Purchasing, serving, or furnishing alcohol for/to a minor.\n\nc. Selling, manufacturing, or distributing alcohol illegally.\n\nd. Possession, production, or provision of false ID.\n\ne. Operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. Driving on or off campus under the influence of drugs or alcohol is prohibited. Fines are assessed, and driving privileges on campus will be suspended. Students who are charged by law enforcement officers with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and are awaiting the court outcome shall have their campus driving privileges suspended pending the court disposition. In those incidents where the DUI involves an accident with injuries to others, or other exceptional factors, immediate disciplinary action may take place.\n\nf. Bringing alcohol to a Middlebury event, or leaving a Middlebury event with alcoholic beverages provided at the event without approval.\n\ng. Possessing alcoholic beverages in unauthorized spaces. Open containers of alcohol are prohibited in public spaces, or outside on the campus grounds, unless the area has been designated for a registered or catered event.\n\nh. Engaging in drinking games and other behaviors designed for the purpose of becoming intoxicated through the abusive use of alcohol (e.g., funnels, keg stands, “around-the-world” parties, and other alcohol consumption based on speed and/or volume, etc.).\n\ni. Administering alcohol to individuals against their will and/or without their knowledge.\n\nj. Repeated unsafe intoxication.\n\nk. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Middlebury-College Specific</span>: The following actions are specifically prohibited at Middlebury College:\n\n1.  Violating party regulations. Party regulations may be found in the office of the Dean of Students and the Department of Public Safety, and at [go/party](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/residential-life/student-responsibilities-and-expectation/party-information). Small, informal gatherings held in individual rooms, suites, and small houses occupied by students of legal age, at which alcoholic beverages are consumed, do not have to be registered. Residents of the living space will be treated as \"party hosts,\" and held responsible for the actions of individuals in attendance. Students are responsible for unregistered gatherings and related activities that occur in their rooms, whether or not they are present.\n\n2.  For purposes of this policy, residential hallways are normally considered private spaces. Students of legal age may transport open alcohol containers for personal use within residence halls, but the use of hallways for parties is prohibited. Individual Commons may designate certain spaces in residence halls as senior commons rooms; these spaces will be considered private.\n\n3.  Possession of alcohol in first-year residence halls.\n\n4.  Possession of kegs or common containers. Possession by students of kegs or common containers (e.g., punch bowls) without advance party registration with the appropriate office (see [go/party](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/residential-life/student-responsibilities-and-expectation/party-information)) is prohibited. Unauthorized kegs or common containers will be confiscated, along with taps, and the Department of Public Safety will return confiscated kegs and taps to the vendor.\n\n5.  Multiple instances involving assignment to a sober friend, and single or multiple instances involving alcohol/drug-related transport to the hospital and/or to detoxification facilities may also result in disciplinary action, consistent with the Medical Amnesty Policy (below).\n\n**<a name=\"drugs\" id=\"drugs\"></a>Drugs**  \nThe following actions are prohibited:\n\na.

Underage use of tobacco. Only persons of legal age (21 or older in Vermont, and as defined by the laws of a foreign host country) may possess or consume tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco substitutes, or tobacco paraphernalia including e-cigarettes.

As such, the primary goal of the conduct system is to educate and engage students by providing information, tools, and space for facilitated reflection. The College utilizes evidence-based educational opportunities to support informed decision making regarding students’ personal and academic success, as informed by Middlebury’s Community Standards, listed below.\n\n- Cultivating respect and responsibility for self, others, and our shared environment;\n- Encouraging personal and intellectual courage and growth;\n- Manifesting integrity and honesty in all decisions and actions;\n- Promoting healthy, safe, and balanced lifestyles; and\n- Fostering a diverse and inclusive community committed to civility, open-mindedness and finding common ground.\n\nTo address concerning behaviors, students will complete an educational sanction designed to help them understand the effects of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs on their mind, body and community, and to reflect on their individual goals and values. Failure to complete educational sanctions will result in an additional charge of failure to engage and may affect the student’s current or future standing at Middlebury. Repeated documented incidents will result in a probationary period for students. Once a student has exhausted the educational interventions available to them through Middlebury, or refuses to engage in educational intervention methods, the student will, in effect, jeopardize their ability to remain a student at Middlebury and will likely face discipline up to and including suspension or expulsion.\n\n**Sanctions for Students in the Undergraduate Program at Middlebury's Vermont Campus**\n\nEducational and/or preventative responses such as a group class, online course, individual meeting, substance use assessment, referral to support resources, or other appropriate course of action will be required of students found responsible for violating the Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs Policy. Educational sanctions are assigned with the following important caveats:\n\n1\\. Where more than one policy has been violated in an incident, or the student has a prior history of conduct violations, students may expect more severe outcomes.\n\n2\\. Outcomes may vary depending on the nature, severity, and impact, actual or potential, of the policy violation(s) and the student’s conduct and health history.\n\n3\\. The range of possible disciplinary sanctions, in addition to educational sanctions, is set forth and defined in the General Disciplinary Processes under “[Sanctions](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/general-disciplinary-process#sanctions)” and, depending on the severity of the conduct, may also include referral for prosecution (as determined by the state’s attorney or other appropriate officials) and/or the completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program. Disciplinary sanctions may be assigned to students in addition to educational sanctions.\n\n**Sanctions for Students at Middlebury's Language Schools, Schools Abroad, Bread Loaf, School of the Environment and MiddCORE Summer Programs**  \nDisciplinary sanctions for students enrolled in Middlebury programs other than the undergraduate program (e.g., Language Schools, Schools Abroad, Bread Loaf School of English, MiddCORE Summer program) will be issued in accordance with the disciplinary procedures applicable to the program in which the student is enrolled at the time of the incident. Sanctions may include warnings, reprimands, probationary status, a letter of official college discipline, suspension or expulsion (see also [Sanctions](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/general-disciplinary-process#sanctions)). The disciplinary officials in those programs may, in their discretion, issue sanctions in accordance with the general outline of expected outcomes in the Sanctions chart referenced above (including educational outcomes).\n\n**Sanctions for Students at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey**  \nDisciplinary sanctions for students who violate this policy will be imposed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the [Student Conduct Disciplinary Process](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/b-policies-governing-student-conduct-and-student-organizations/b-conduct/b-2-d-student-conduct-disciplinary-process). While discipline is cumulative at the Institute, which may mean the assignment of greater sanctions for repeated or accumulated violations, it is not progressive. That is, depending on the severity of the violation, a student may receive any sanction, even for a first offense. Outcomes may vary depending on the nature, severity, and impact, actual or potential, of any of the violations and the student's conduct and health history. Sanctions could also include referral to an educational or rehabilitation program.\n\nThe range of possible sanctions is set forth and defined in the \"[Sanctions](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/b-policies-governing-student-conduct-and-student-organizations/b-conduct/b-2-d-student-conduct-disciplinary-process/d-sanctions-for-general-non-academic-offenses)\" section of the [Student Conduct Disciplinary Process](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/b-policies-governing-student-conduct-and-student-organizations/b-conduct/b-2-d-student-conduct-disciplinary-process) and, depending on the severity of the conduct, may also include referral for prosecution (as determined by the state's attorney or other appropriate officials) and/or the completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program. These sanctions are defined in the Student Conduct Disciplinary process and include a warning, reprimand, probation, loss of privileges, fines, restitution, discretionary sanctions, suspension, expulsion, and revocation of admission and/or degree. The Institute may also temporarily withhold awarding a degree otherwise earned until the completion of the process set forth in the Student Conduct Disciplinary Process, including the completion of all sanctions imposed, if any. More than one of the sanctions listed above may be imposed for any single violation. For more information regarding sanctions, please see the Student Conduct Disciplinary Process.\n\n**<a name=\"amensty\" id=\"amensty\"></a>Medical Amnesty Policy**  \nMiddlebury’s Medical Amnesty Policy is intended to encourage students to seek swift medical assistance for themselves and others without fear of penalty. Our primary concern is the health and safety of our students. We urge students not only to take care of their own well-being, but to behave in an equally responsible way with their peers.\n\nThere may be times when safety concerns arise from a student’s excessive drinking or drug use, and in these situations, students should not hesitate to seek help from the Student Life/Services staff, Public Safety/Campus Security, medical or counseling professionals, and/or local or state police out of fear of disciplinary action. Under this Medical Amnesty Policy, neither the student in distress nor the student or organization seeking assistance will ordinarily be subject to disciplinary action for the possession, provision, or consumption of drugs or alcohol. Educational and/or preventative responses such as a group class, online course, individual meeting, substance use assessment, referral to support resources, or other appropriate course of action may be required.\n\nThis policy refers to isolated incidents only, and does not excuse or protect those who flagrantly or repeatedly violate the Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs Policy, nor does it preclude disciplinary action arising from violations of other Middlebury policies. However, in cases involving additional policy violations, Middlebury will consider the positive impact of reporting an incident as well as the health and safety needs of the involved student(s) when determining the appropriate course of action.\n\nThis policy cannot protect students from action by law enforcement personnel, but it is consistent with laws enacted by Vermont and California that provide limited immunity from prosecution to a witness or victim of a drug or alcohol overdose who seeks medical assistance to save the life of an overdose victim. For more information about the Vermont statute, please see [18 V.S.A. § 4254](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/18/084/04254).

Any member of the Middlebury community having knowledge of an individual on campus who is abusing alcohol or in possession of or using illegal drugs, or misusing legal substances to cause impairment/hallucination, is urged to encourage the individual to seek counseling and/or medical assistance. All members of the community are also expected to help protect the community health by informing appropriate staff members of instances of alcohol and/or drug misuse, distribution, and/or sales.\n\nInvolvement with or dependency upon drugs or excessive or illegal use of alcohol is viewed by Middlebury as a health concern as well as a disciplinary matter. Any time a dean, staff member, faculty member or appropriate supervisory authority has reasonable concerns that a student’s health is being compromised by alcohol or other drug use (even in cases where no concrete evidence or direct witness is involved), an educational and/or preventative response, such as a group class, online course, individual meeting, substance use assessment, referral to support resources, or other appropriate course of action may be required.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Middlebury College Specific</span>: In addition, the dean or appropriate supervisory authority may notify the student’s parents or guardian of concerns about the student’s drug or alcohol use.\n\n**<a name=\"laws\" id=\"laws\"></a>Laws and Resources**  \nFor information specific to state and federal laws governing the use, possession, and distribution of tobacco, drugs and alcohol, as well as additional counseling and treatment resources and information related to health risks associated with the use of tobacco, illegal drugs and the abuse of alcohol, see:\n\n[Middlebury's Annual Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Notice](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/Resources_and_Compliance_Requirements/drug-free-schools-and-communities-act-notice)\n\n[Middlebury Institute's Annual Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Notice](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/student-life/student-policies/annual-drug-free-schools-and-communities-act-notice)\n\n---\n","excerpt":"September 9 2019 Introduction Policies Alcohol Drugs Tobacco Disciplinary Sanctions for Students Medical Amnesty Policy Disciplinary…","html":"<p><strong>September 9 2019</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/alcohol-drugs#intro\">Introduction</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/alcohol-drugs/#policies\">Policies</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/alcohol-drugs/#alcohol\">Alcohol</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/alcohol-drugs/#drugs\">Drugs</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/alcohol-drugs/#tobacco\">Tobacco</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/alcohol-drugs/#dfs\">Disciplinary Sanctions for Students</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/alcohol-drugs/#amensty\">Medical Amnesty Policy</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/alcohol-drugs/#dffs\">Disciplinary Sanctions for Faculty and Staff</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/alcohol-drugs/#health\">Health and Community Responsibility</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/alcohol-drugs/#laws\">Laws and Resources</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><a name=\"intro\" id=\"intro\"></a>Introduction</strong><br>\nMiddlebury is committed to promoting individual and community health, safety, and responsibility. We require all students and employees to observe local, state, and federal laws governing the possession, use, and furnishing of alcoholic beverages, tobacco and controlled substances, also referred to as illegal drugs, and failure to do so is prohibited. We are also committed to ensuring that, in accordance with the Drug-Free Schools and Community Act of 1989 and the Drug-Free Schools and Campuses Regulations, our policies concerning alcohol, tobacco and drugs contain clear statements about: (1) the standards of conduct prohibiting the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of tobacco, illegal drugs and alcohol by students and employees; (2) that Middlebury will impose disciplinary sanctions on students and employees who violate these policies (consistent with local, state, and federal law); (3) the applicable legal sanctions under local, state, or federal law for the unlawful possession or distribution of tobacco, illegal drugs and alcohol; and (4) health risks and information regarding tobacco, drug or alcohol counseling, treatment or rehabilitation, or reentry programs that are available to students and employees. When tobacco, drug, or alcohol violations occur, disciplinary sanctions will be imposed in accordance with this policy. Serious incidents that put a student or others at risk of harm, as well as repeated offenses, may require a more vigorous response, including referral to counseling or a treatment facility, a leave of absence, and/or disciplinary outcomes as appropriate.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Middlebury will:</p>\n<p>a. Inform students and employees of federal, state, and local laws, and Middlebury policies, to which they are accountable, and hold them accountable to those policies under Middlebury’s governance;</p>\n<p>b. Encourage an environment of enriching extracurricular and social opportunities that includes substance-free events and appropriate venues for students of legal age who choose to drink;</p>\n<p>c. Educate members of the community through academic and student life programs and policies about the health risks associated with tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse, and refer students and employees to resources and health services such as tobacco, drug or alcohol counseling, treatment or rehabilitation, or re-entry programs that are available to students and employees, as applicable.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"polices\" id=\"policies\"></a>Middlebury Policies and Local, State, and Federal Law</strong><br>\nAll students, faculty, staff, and visitors are subject to local, state, and federal laws, as well as Middlebury tobacco, drug and alcohol policy rules and regulations, while on Middlebury-owned or -leased properties or involved with off-campus activities sponsored by Middlebury or a registered Middlebury organization. Middlebury does not protect students or employees from prosecution for tobacco, drug or alcohol offenses under local, state, or federal laws, and does not interfere with legitimate law enforcement activities. Law enforcement officers may have a legal right to search individuals, and with consent or proper documentation may search property—including residences owned or leased by Middlebury —without prior notice. Middlebury also reserves the right to furnish the police with information regarding alleged illegal activities.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Middlebury College Specific</span>: In order to preserve the safety of our residents, the state of Vermont and the College both adhere to policies that limit disciplinary consequences under certain circumstances when appropriate care is sought for individuals in drug- or alcohol-related distress.

Any time a dean, staff member, faculty member or appropriate supervisory authority has reasonable concerns that a student’s health is being compromised by alcohol or other drug use (even in cases where no concrete evidence or direct witness is involved), an educational and/or preventative response, such as a group class, online course, individual meeting, substance use assessment, referral to support resources, or other appropriate course of action may be required.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Middlebury College Specific</span>: In addition, the dean or appropriate supervisory authority may notify the student’s parents or guardian of concerns about the student’s drug or alcohol use.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"laws\" id=\"laws\"></a>Laws and Resources</strong><br>\nFor information specific to state and federal laws governing the use, possession, and distribution of tobacco, drugs and alcohol, as well as additional counseling and treatment resources and information related to health risks associated with the use of tobacco, illegal drugs and the abuse of alcohol, see:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/Resources_and_Compliance_Requirements/drug-free-schools-and-communities-act-notice\">Middlebury's Annual Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Notice</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/student-life/student-policies/annual-drug-free-schools-and-communities-act-notice\">Middlebury Institute's Annual Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Notice</a></p>\n<hr>"},"c2b72a6a-d98e-55b8-b551-1d875a18b298":{"id":"c2b72a6a-d98e-55b8-b551-1d875a18b298","slug":"/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/demonst-protests","title":"C.4. Demonstration Regulations","body":"\nIn keeping with Middlebury’s Open Expression Policy, these Regulations provide the process for ensuring demonstrations can occur safely and establish Middlebury’s time, place and manner requirements.  These time, place and manner requirements are intended to ensure safety as well as to protect Middlebury’s ability to fulfil its essential operations.  Essential operations are operations that are necessary for the daily or regular operation of Middlebury to support and carry out our educational mission and typically cannot be easily moved to another location.  For example, teaching classes, maintaining heat and power to the campus, supporting campus events and activities, providing meals to students in residence, clearing snow and ice, are examples of some of Middlebury’s essential operations.\n\nMiddlebury’s mission is to promote intellectual inquiry and exchange in accordance with our three pillars of academic freedom, integrity and respect. The safety of all participants is of utmost importance to Middlebury, and Event Sponsors as well as individual protestors will be obligated to comply with Middlebury requirements designed to protect the safety of our community and to allow Middlebury to maintain its essential operations.\n\n1.  Anyone who wishes to stage a demonstration or protest on Middlebury property, whether or not it is in response to another event, must submit an Event Scheduling Request.  This is required in order for Middlebury staff and offices to review the event to determine whether there are safety or other operational considerations that should be addressed.\n2.  After submitting an event scheduling request, the Event Sponsor(s) should contact both Public Safety and Events Management offices to schedule a meeting to review Middlebury policies, these Regulations, and safety and operational issues in general.\n3.  The following time, place and manner requirements  are ordinarily determined by Events Management in response to an Event Request, in consultation with Public Safety and the office of the VPSA:\n\n    <p style=\"padding-left:60px\">a. Location</p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:90px\">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; The location of a demonstration will be determined by Events\n            Management and other offices. Demonstrations will ordinarily occur in outdoor areas of a Middlebury\n            campus that are generally open to the public.\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:90px\">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; If the demonstration is in response to another Middlebury event,\n            the location of the requested demonstration will be determined with consideration for\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:120px\">a.

An application and\n            instructions for the town's permit may be found <a\n                    href=\"https://www.townofmiddlebury.org/town_departments_services_staff/town_manager_s_office/public_assemblage_permit.php\">here</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:90px\">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp; Individuals participating in demonstrations may not trespass in\n            areas of the campus that are not generally open and available to members of the public.&nbsp; Example of\n            places where demonstrators may not trespass include but are not limited to: residence rooms and private\n            offices; academic and administrative buildings when closed; buildings and spaces not designed for\n            overnight occupancy; specifically restricted spaces such as mechanical rooms, labs, technology spaces,\n            etc.&nbsp; Ordinarily, Middlebury warns individuals who are trespassing that they are in a restricted\n            area or that a building is closed.&nbsp; After such a warning, which may include posted signs, a notice\n            not to trespass, or a verbal warning by a Middlebury official, trespassing individuals are subject to\n            arrest by local law enforcement.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:60px\">b. Time and Duration: Demonstrations may not interfere with the academic,\n            educational or operational functions of Middlebury. The time and duration of the demonstration will be\n            determined by Events Management in consultation with Public Safety and other offices, as appropriate to\n            the circumstances, with consideration of the following factors:\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:90px\">i. Nature of the event and/or the demonstration<br>ii. Security needs of the event\n            and/or the demonstration<br> iii. Time of the event and/or the demonstration<br>iv.

Demonstrations must occur in the approved location.<br>ii. Demonstrations may\n            not block access to the venue in which another event is being held.<br>iii. Demonstrations may not be\n            unreasonably noisy, such that the noise level disrupts Middlebury’s campus activities or\n            operations.<br>iv. Middlebury may restrict objects that are permitted to be brought into the Event\n            location, such as bullhorns, hard or wooden signs, backpacks, large objects, things that would block\n            others’ view.<br>v. Demonstrations may not include weapons, open flames or other hazardous\n            materials.<br>vi. Participants in a demonstration may be asked for identification at any time to ensure\n            they are members of the Middlebury community or are otherwise permitted to be in open areas of\n            Middlebury’s campus.\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:60px\">d. Event Sponsors are required to participate in meetings and discussions needed to\n            plan for the safety and security of an event, as well as to respond in a timely way to email and other\n            communications from Events Management, Public Safety, the office of the VPSA and others.&nbsp; Failure\n            to communicate appropriately and participate in necessary planning may result in Middlebury declining to\n            provide the resources to support the Event Sponsor’s requested event.\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:60px\">e. If necessary, Public Safety will develop a security plan.&nbsp; Event Sponsors\n            are required to comply with the security plan, which may include utilization of local law enforcement,\n            including but not limited to the Middlebury Police Department and the Vermont State Police.&nbsp;\n            Middlebury’s town Police Department and the State Police are ultimately responsible for keeping the\n            peace on Middlebury’s campus.\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:60px\">\n        f. Event Sponsors are required to support and comply with the security plan\n        developed by Public Safety, and as applicable, local law enforcement.&nbsp; Specifically, Event Sponsors\n            may request particular conditions for entry to an event or other aspects of how the Event will be\n            organized, such as the time doors open, restricted items, whether tickets or a Midd ID is required.\n            However, the final conditions for the Event will be determined by Middlebury.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:60px\">g. Once the conditions and requirements for the event are determined, and a final\n            security plan from Public Safety is issued, Event Sponsor(s) will send an email announcement of these\n            requirements to the Middlebury community and will post the requirements at the event entrance. The Event\n            Sponsor(s) may be required to assist in monitoring the entry to ensure that the requirements are being\n            followed and/or to address any related issues or questions.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:60px\">h. If substantially disruptive protest occurs at the Event, the Event Sponsor(s)\n            are responsible for upholding Middlebury’s Open Expression Policy by asking that the substantially\n            disruptive behavior stop, by warning that substantially disruptive behavior may result in the individual\n            being removed from the event and subject to discipline in accordance with Middlebury’s policies, and by\n            notifying Public Safety or other appropriate Middlebury official.\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:60px\">i. The Event Sponsor(s) are responsible for contacting Public Safety at any time\n            that safety and security are at risk of being compromised.\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:60px\">j. Important logistic requirements</p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:90px\">\n    i. Connection to Middlebury’s utilities (power, etc.) or erection of any structure\n            must be approved in advance (during the weekday) by Facilities Services.<br>ii. Demonstrators may not\n            mark or use trees or Middlebury structures to support or display signs, messages, materials, or\n            equipment without prior approval of Facilities Services.<br>iii. Objects normally permitted on campus\n            may be prohibited when used in a manner that violates other polices (e.g., when a permitted object is\n            used in a threatening manner). If a Middlebury official determines that an object is being used in\n            violation of policy, demonstrators will be required to comply with whatever orders are given for the\n            disposition of the item.<br>iv. Organizers must remove all items and materials at the end of the\n            demonstration</p>\n\n    </p>\n\n4.  Distribution of materials such as leaflets must allow people to decline to receive the materials and may not prevent people from receiving other material or engaging with another person.\n\n5.  Middlebury may choose to record demonstrations, protests, rallies, etc., as it does a number of events, by photos and/or videos.  Such recording may occur through security cameras, whether stationary or not, with personal cameras, by Middlebury staff or local law enforcement, as well as other practical means. Documenting a demonstration provides protection both for those participating as evidence of peaceful activity and for Middlebury as evidence of any violation of policy, and is helpful for holding both participants and Middlebury accountable for compliance with all policies.\n\n6.  Community members may be asked for Middlebury-issued identification at any time, including during demonstrations, protests or other related events, by Middlebury officials to confirm that the person is a member of the community and has the ability to be on our campus. Students, specifically, are obligated under our [Handbook policies](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/genl-cond-standards) to identify themselves when asked to do so by a Middlebury official, including Public Safety as well as other staff. Members of the public may also be asked for identification.\n\n7.  Public Safety staff are responsible for keeping the peace, in accordance with their departmental policies, as well as for coordinating with and supporting local law enforcement in order to keep the peace.  Public Safety has the authority to respond to acts of violence, threats of violence, or overcrowding as appropriate to protect the safety of Middlebury community members.  Public Safety ordinarily responds to substantially disruptive behavior by asking the person or persons to identify themselves and to stop the behavior, prior to documenting the person’s conduct as a violation of policy or taking further action, such as engaging law enforcement, as appropriate to the circumstances. Other Middlebury officials may also issue warnings to individuals or groups to facilitate enforcement of Middlebury’s Policy on Open Expression.\n\n8.  Individuals who engage in substantially disruptive behavior will generally be warned once, which may be done individually or to a group of participants.  Any Middlebury official in attendance will ordinarily request identification, document substantially disruptive behavior, and record it to facilitate enforcement of Middlebury’s Policy on Open Expression.\n\n9.  Guidelines for Sanctions - Students\n    <p style=\"padding-left:60px\">a. The following guidelines are provided to ensure consistent and transparent\n    sanctions for students who violate the Policy on Open Expression and these Demonstration Regulations.\n    The recommended sanctions are typical examples and should not be read to prevent lesser sanctions for\n    less serious behavior, or greater penalties for more serious behavior. The range of sanctions below is\n    not an exhaustive list as other sanctions including loss or restriction of Middlebury privileges or\n    future Middlebury opportunities, educational/reparative assignments and/or fines or restitution may be\n    issued as appropriate to the circumstances (see also <a\n                        href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/general-disciplinary-process#sanctions\">Sanctions</a>).\n    Prior conduct and judicial history may also be taken into account in determining sanctions.\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:90px\">i.<em> </em>Warned about substantial disruption, asked to leave, leaves voluntarily\n    without further disruption: <em>Range is ordinarily no sanction; a reprimand may be appropriate for\n    disruption clearly intended to prevent someone else’s expression.</em></p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:90px\">ii.<em> </em>Warned about substantial disruption, asked to leave, leaves\n    voluntarily though disruptively: <em>Range is ordinarily a reprimand to probationary status.</em></p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:90px\">iii.

Warned, asked to leave, refuses and/or must be escorted or arrested by law\n    enforcement and effectively prevents open expression: <em>Depending on the severity of disruption, range\n    is ordinarily from a letter of official college discipline to suspension.</em></p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left:90px\">v.

Middlebury will not attempt or endeavor to care for, protect or control such minors, on the assumption that those duties are being performed by their parents, guardians, or other responsible adult(s). However, sections 3, 7, 8, 9 & 10 of this policy apply to incidents involving such minors. If Middlebury receives a report of alleged prohibited behavior under this policy that involves such a minor and an individual over whom Middlebury has some measure of control, Middlebury will endeavor to undertake an investigation and to take appropriate remedial action.\n\n**Program Sponsor:** The department, club, organization, student, faculty, staff person, volunteer, or third party sponsoring the program.\n\n**Authorized Adult:** Students, faculty, staff, volunteers, or third parties who have been background checked and approved to supervise or otherwise interact with minors.\n\n**3.  <span>Prohibited Conduct</span>**\n\nAll program sponsors, authorized adults, or any other individual who supervises or interacts with minors on Middlebury property or in connection with Middlebury programs are expected to conduct themselves appropriately and maintain the highest standards of professionalism, ethics, and personal behavior.

This includes the name(s), address(es), and telephone number(s) of the minor’s parents or guardians.\n\nOnly those who have a legitimate need to know should have access to information about minors. Otherwise, information about minors should not be disclosed (e.g., authorized pick-up and drop off of parties, the name and address of overnight stay locations, and any other information that could be used to lure a child).\n\n**7.  Reports to Middlebury Officials**\n\n**In case of an emergency or if safety is of immediate concern, dial 911**.\n\nAny person who has reasonable cause to believe that a child has been abused or neglected or that anyone has engaged in prohibited conduct involving a child as defined in Section 3 of this policy should contact the Department of Public Safety (802.443.5911; Vermont campus), other campus safety/security personnel applicable to the program at issue, and/or the appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue (see contact information in [Appendix A](#A)<span>,</span> below).

If the complaint includes allegations of sexual misconduct, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or harassment, the matter will be addressed in accordance with Middlebury’s [Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic  and Dating Violence and Misconduct, and Stalking](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/handbook_archive/handbook-2017-2018/policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/smdvs) and/or [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin) (as applicable). Complaints against undergraduate students who are enrolled in another Middlebury program at the time the alleged conduct occurred may be addressed in accordance with that program’s disciplinary processes and/or in accordance with Middlebury’s Student Life Policy-General Disciplinary Processes, as appropriate. Complaints against student employees may be addressed in accordance with applicable employment policies and/or Middlebury’s Student Life policies, as appropriate.\n\n**8.**  **Mandated Reporting Under Vermont Law and Other Applicable State Laws**\n\nUnder Vermont law ([33 V.S.A. § 4913](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/33/049/04913)), certain individuals who reasonably suspect abuse or neglect of a child are **required to make report** in accordance with the provisions of [33 V.S.A. § 4914](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/33/049/04914) **within 24 hours** of the time information regarding the suspected abuse or neglect was first received or observed.

Individuals with mandatory reporting obligations are listed below.\n\nThe following professionals are required to report:\n\n- Health care provider, including any physicians (including resident physicians and interns), surgeons, osteopaths, chiropractors, physician's assistants, hospital administrators, nurses, medical examiners, dentists, psychologists, pharmacists, emergency medical personnel, or other health-care providers\n- An individual who is employed by a school district or an approved or recognized independent school, or who is contracted and paid by a school district or an approved or recognized independent school to provide student services, including school superintendents, teachers, student teachers, school librarians, child care workers, school principals, school guidance counselors, mental health professionals, or social workers\n- Employees, contractors, and grantees of the agency of human services who have contact with clients\n- Probation officers, police officers\n- Camp owners, camp administrators or camp counselors (camp includes any residential or nonresidential recreational program)\n- Members of the clergy\n\nA mandatory reporter (as defined under Vermont law) who fails to report as required above may be subject to fines or imprisonment (see [33 V.S.A. § 4913 (h))](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/33/049/04913).\n\nIn addition to the above mandated reporters, Vermont law provides that any other person who has reasonable cause to believe that a child has been abused or neglected *may* report or cause a report to be made to DCF in accordance with [33 V.S.A. § 4914](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/33/049/04914).\n\nAny person other than a person suspected of child abuse, who in good faith makes a report to the Department shall be immune from any civil or criminal liability which might otherwise be incurred or imposed as a result of making the report (see [33 V.S.A. § 4913](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/33/049/04913)).\n\nA person may not refuse to make a report required by law on the grounds that making the report would violate a privilege or disclose a confidential communication, except that a member of the clergy shall not be required to make a report under [33 V.S.A. § 4913](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/33/049/04913) if the report would be based on information received in a communication which is: (1) made to a member of the clergy acting in his or her capacity as a spiritual advisor; (2) intended by the parties to be confidential at the time the communication is made; (3) intended by the communicant to be an act of contrition or a matter of conscience; and (4) required to be confidential by religious law, doctrine or tenet.\n\nWhen a member of the clergy receives information about abuse or neglect of a child in a manner other than as described above, he or she is required to report on the basis of that information even though he or she may have also received a report of abuse or neglect about the same person or incident in the manner described in the previous paragraph.\n\nReports shall be made orally or in writing to DCF. Reports shall contain the name and address or other contact information of the reporter as well as the names and addresses of the child and the parents or other persons responsible for the child's care, if known; the age of the child; the nature and extent of the child's injuries together with any evidence of previous abuse and neglect of the child or the child's siblings; and any other information that might be helpful in establishing the cause of the injuries or reasons for the neglect as well as in protecting the child and assisting the family (see [33 V.S.A. §4914](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/33/049/04914)).\n\nThe name of and any identifying information about either the person making the report to DCF or any person mentioned in the report shall be confidential unless:\n\n- The person making the report specifically allows disclosure.\n- A Human Services Board proceeding or a judicial proceeding results from the report.\n- A court, after a hearing, finds probable cause to believe that the report was not made in good faith and orders the Department to make the name of the reporter available.\n- A review of the allegation is requested and DCF determines that identifying information can be provided without compromising the safety of the reporter or the persons mentioned in the report.\n\nUnder Vermont law, Middlebury is prohibited from taking any adverse employment action against an employee on the basis that he/she made a good faith report of suspected child abuse to the DCF.\n\nMandatory state law reporting requirements applicable to Middlebury programs in California, New Mexico, and Washington, D.C., are set forth in [Appendix B](#B).\n\n**9.

California**\n\nUnder California law, Cal. Penal Code § 11164-11174.3, certain individuals are **required** to report any incident where they have knowledge, observe, or reasonably suspect that a minor has been abused or neglected. The report **must** be made **immediately** or as soon as practically possible by phone to a county welfare department, probation department (if it is designated by the county to receive mandated reports), or to a police or sheriff’s department (not including a school district police or security department). A written report must be submitted on a Department of Justice form within 36 hours (forms are available here: [https://oag.ca.gov/childabuse/forms](https://oag.ca.gov/childabuse/forms)). Individuals with mandatory reporting obligations are listed below.\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of professionals who are required to report:\n\n- Clergy members and any custodian of records of a clergy member\n- Child care providers\n- Educators\n- Law enforcement\n- Medical professionals\n- Mental health professionals\n- Commercial film and photographic print processors\n\nA complete list of mandated reporters is provided in California Penal Code section 11165.7.<a title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref1\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a>\n\nIn addition to the above mandated reporters, California law provides that “any other person” who has knowledge, observes, or reasonably suspects that a child has been abused or neglected *may* make a report to a county welfare department, probation department (if it is designated by the county to receive mandated reports), or to a police or sheriff’s department (not including a school district police or security department). California Penal Code sections 11166(g), 11165.9.\n\nThere are certain exceptions to the mandatory reporting requirement based on privilege. A clergy member who acquires evidence during a penitential communication is not required to report. The attorney-client privilege is preserved, such that a lawyer or his/her agent is not required to report. Reports shall contain the name, business address, and telephone number of the mandated reporter and the capacity that makes the person a mandated reporter. One who reports but is not a mandatory reporter is not required to include his/her name.\n\nThe identity of the person making the report shall be confidential and disclosed only among agencies receiving and investigating mandated reports, to the prosecutor in a criminal proceeding or appointed counsel, unless the person reporting waives confidentiality or disclosure is required by court order.\n\nUnder California law, Middlebury and its affiliates are prohibited from sanctioning an employee on the basis that s/he made a report of suspected child abuse, nor is the employer able to impede or impair the reporter’s reporting duties or require that the reporter disclose his or her identity to the employer.\n\n#### **II.  New Mexico**\n\nUnder New Mexico law, N.M.S.A.. § 32A-4-3, certain individuals are **required** to report any incident where the person knows or has a reasonable suspicion that a minor has been abused or neglected. The report **must** be made **immediately** to a local law enforcement agency, the Children, Youth, and Families Department, or a trial law enforcement or social services agency for any Indian child residing in an Indian county.\n\nIt is established that following professionals are required to report:\n\n- Licensed physician, resident or intern, a registered nurse\n- Law enforcement officer\n- A school teacher or official\n- A social worker acting in an official capacity\n- A member of the clergy\n\nIn addition to the above mandated reporters, it is presently an open question whether “every person” with knowledge or a reasonable suspicion of abuse or neglect is a mandated reporter under New Mexico law. <a title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref2\" href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a>\n\nA person may not refuse to make a report required by law on the grounds that making the report would be privileged as a matter of law, except for a member of the clergy. Reports shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of the reporter.\n\nA person reporting an instance of alleged child neglect or abuse is immune from civil or criminal liability, unless the person reporting acted in bad faith or with malicious purpose. New Mexico law does not, however, explicitly state that the reporter’s identity will remain confidential, nor does it explicitly protect the reporter from retaliation by his/her employer.\n\n#### **III.  Washington, D.C.**\n\nUnder Washington D.C. law, D.C. Code § 4-1321.02, certain individuals are **required** to report any incident where they know or have reasonable cause to suspect that a minor has been abused or neglected. The report **must** be made **immediately** to either the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia or the Child and Family Services Agency. Individuals with mandatory reporting obligations are listed below.\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of professionals who are required to report:\n\n- Child and Family Services Agency employees, agents, and contractors\n- Every physician, psychologist, medical examiner, dentist, chiropractor, registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, person involved in the care and treatment of patients\n- Law enforcement officers\n- School officials, teachers, athletic coaches\n- Domestic violence counselors\n- Mental health professionals\n\nWhenever a person is required to report in his or her capacity as a member of the staff of a school, she or he shall immediately notify the person in charge of the institution, or his or her designated agent, who shall then be required to make the report. This requirement does not relieve the staff-member of his or her obligation to make a report to the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia or the Child and Family Services Agency.\n\nIn addition to the above mandated reporters, Washington D.C. law provides that any other person *may* make a report to the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia or the Child and Family Services Agency.\n\nThe Washington D.C. statute does not explicitly state whether a party may refuse to make a report otherwise required by law on the basis of privilege. The report shall contain include:\n\n- The name, age, sex, and address of (A) the child who is the subject of the report; (B) each of the child's siblings and other children in the household; and (C) each of the child's parents or other persons responsible for the child's care;\n- The nature and extent of the abuse or neglect of the child and any previous abuse or neglect, if known;\n- All other information which the person making the report believes may be helpful in establishing the cause of the abuse or neglect and the identity of the person responsible for the abuse or neglect.\n\nIf the reporter was required to report under Washington D.C. law, the report must also contain the identity and occupation of the source, how to contact the source, and a statement of the actions by the source concerning the child.\n\nWashington D.C. law does not specifically address the confidentiality of the identity of the reporter or provide any protections to the reporter against retaliation or adverse employment action.\n\n---\n\n<a title=\"\" id=\"_ftn1\" href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> See [https://law.onecle.com/california/penal/11165.7.html](https://law.onecle.com/california/penal/11165.7.html)\n\n<a title=\"\" id=\"_ftn2\" href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> The statute reads that “every person” is required to report.  N.M.S.A. § 32A-4-3 (a).  Despite the statute’s plain language, the New Mexico Court of Appeals has held that that words “every person” only mean the professionals specifically identified in the statute (i.e. the professionals listed in the preceding bullet points).  *State v.

California</strong></h4>\n<p>Under California law, Cal. Penal Code § 11164-11174.3, certain individuals are <strong>required</strong> to report any incident where they have knowledge, observe, or reasonably suspect that a minor has been abused or neglected. The report <strong>must</strong> be made <strong>immediately</strong> or as soon as practically possible by phone to a county welfare department, probation department (if it is designated by the county to receive mandated reports), or to a police or sheriff’s department (not including a school district police or security department). A written report must be submitted on a Department of Justice form within 36 hours (forms are available here: <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/childabuse/forms\">https://oag.ca.gov/childabuse/forms</a>). Individuals with mandatory reporting obligations are listed below.</p>\n<p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of professionals who are required to report:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clergy members and any custodian of records of a clergy member</li>\n<li>Child care providers</li>\n<li>Educators</li>\n<li>Law enforcement</li>\n<li>Medical professionals</li>\n<li>Mental health professionals</li>\n<li>Commercial film and photographic print processors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A complete list of mandated reporters is provided in California Penal Code section 11165.7.<a title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref1\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a></p>\n<p>In addition to the above mandated reporters, California law provides that “any other person” who has knowledge, observes, or reasonably suspects that a child has been abused or neglected <em>may</em> make a report to a county welfare department, probation department (if it is designated by the county to receive mandated reports), or to a police or sheriff’s department (not including a school district police or security department). California Penal Code sections 11166(g), 11165.9.</p>\n<p>There are certain exceptions to the mandatory reporting requirement based on privilege. A clergy member who acquires evidence during a penitential communication is not required to report. The attorney-client privilege is preserved, such that a lawyer or his/her agent is not required to report. Reports shall contain the name, business address, and telephone number of the mandated reporter and the capacity that makes the person a mandated reporter. One who reports but is not a mandatory reporter is not required to include his/her name.</p>\n<p>The identity of the person making the report shall be confidential and disclosed only among agencies receiving and investigating mandated reports, to the prosecutor in a criminal proceeding or appointed counsel, unless the person reporting waives confidentiality or disclosure is required by court order.</p>\n<p>Under California law, Middlebury and its affiliates are prohibited from sanctioning an employee on the basis that s/he made a report of suspected child abuse, nor is the employer able to impede or impair the reporter’s reporting duties or require that the reporter disclose his or her identity to the employer.</p>\n<h4><strong>II.  New Mexico</strong></h4>\n<p>Under New Mexico law, N.M.S.A.. § 32A-4-3, certain individuals are <strong>required</strong> to report any incident where the person knows or has a reasonable suspicion that a minor has been abused or neglected. The report <strong>must</strong> be made <strong>immediately</strong> to a local law enforcement agency, the Children, Youth, and Families Department, or a trial law enforcement or social services agency for any Indian child residing in an Indian county.</p>\n<p>It is established that following professionals are required to report:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Licensed physician, resident or intern, a registered nurse</li>\n<li>Law enforcement officer</li>\n<li>A school teacher or official</li>\n<li>A social worker acting in an official capacity</li>\n<li>A member of the clergy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the above mandated reporters, it is presently an open question whether “every person” with knowledge or a reasonable suspicion of abuse or neglect is a mandated reporter under New Mexico law. <a title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref2\" href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a></p>\n<p>A person may not refuse to make a report required by law on the grounds that making the report would be privileged as a matter of law, except for a member of the clergy. Reports shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of the reporter.</p>\n<p>A person reporting an instance of alleged child neglect or abuse is immune from civil or criminal liability, unless the person reporting acted in bad faith or with malicious purpose. New Mexico law does not, however, explicitly state that the reporter’s identity will remain confidential, nor does it explicitly protect the reporter from retaliation by his/her employer.</p>\n<h4><strong>III.  Washington, D.C.</strong></h4>\n<p>Under Washington D.C. law, D.C. Code § 4-1321.02, certain individuals are <strong>required</strong> to report any incident where they know or have reasonable cause to suspect that a minor has been abused or neglected. The report <strong>must</strong> be made <strong>immediately</strong> to either the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia or the Child and Family Services Agency. Individuals with mandatory reporting obligations are listed below.</p>\n<p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of professionals who are required to report:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Child and Family Services Agency employees, agents, and contractors</li>\n<li>Every physician, psychologist, medical examiner, dentist, chiropractor, registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, person involved in the care and treatment of patients</li>\n<li>Law enforcement officers</li>\n<li>School officials, teachers, athletic coaches</li>\n<li>Domestic violence counselors</li>\n<li>Mental health professionals</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whenever a person is required to report in his or her capacity as a member of the staff of a school, she or he shall immediately notify the person in charge of the institution, or his or her designated agent, who shall then be required to make the report. This requirement does not relieve the staff-member of his or her obligation to make a report to the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia or the Child and Family Services Agency.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above mandated reporters, Washington D.C. law provides that any other person <em>may</em> make a report to the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia or the Child and Family Services Agency.</p>\n<p>The Washington D.C. statute does not explicitly state whether a party may refuse to make a report otherwise required by law on the basis of privilege. The report shall contain include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The name, age, sex, and address of (A) the child who is the subject of the report; (B) each of the child's siblings and other children in the household; and (C) each of the child's parents or other persons responsible for the child's care;</li>\n<li>The nature and extent of the abuse or neglect of the child and any previous abuse or neglect, if known;</li>\n<li>All other information which the person making the report believes may be helpful in establishing the cause of the abuse or neglect and the identity of the person responsible for the abuse or neglect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the reporter was required to report under Washington D.C. law, the report must also contain the identity and occupation of the source, how to contact the source, and a statement of the actions by the source concerning the child.</p>\n<p>Washington D.C. law does not specifically address the confidentiality of the identity of the reporter or provide any protections to the reporter against retaliation or adverse employment action.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a title=\"\" id=\"_ftn1\" href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> See <a href=\"https://law.onecle.com/california/penal/11165.7.html\">https://law.onecle.com/california/penal/11165.7.html</a></p>\n<p><a title=\"\" id=\"_ftn2\" href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> The statute reads that “every person” is required to report.  N.M.S.A. § 32A-4-3 (a).  Despite the statute’s plain language, the New Mexico Court of Appeals has held that that words “every person” only mean the professionals specifically identified in the statute (i.e. the professionals listed in the preceding bullet points).  <em>State v. Strauch</em>, 2014-NMCA-020, 317 P.3d 878, 881 (N.M. Ct.App. 2013). The New Mexico Supreme Court has decided to review this question. <em>State v. Strauch</em>, 321 P.3d 936 (N.M. Ct. App. 2014) (granting cert).

Introduction & Purpose**\n\nMiddlebury is committed to maintaining campus and workplace environments that are safe and secure for all students, staff, faculty, and visitors. As part of this commitment, Middlebury has established two Threat Assessment and Management Teams (“TAM”), which are empowered to assess risk and, in cooperation with other Middlebury teams or offices as appropriate, formulate an appropriate response in situations where an individual’s behavior and/or statements indicate they may present a threat to the health or safety of others.  The Vermont TAM is responsible for all the programs based in Vermont and elsewhere except that the Institute TAM is responsible for the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. The TAMs seek to mitigate potential risks before they result in harm.\n\nNothing in this policy shall be construed to alter or amend other applicable Middlebury policies.\n\n**<a name=\"tam\" id=\"tam\"></a>II. Threat Assessment Team**\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer appoints the members of the Vermont TAM and names its chair, and appoints new or different team members as necessary; the VPAA/Dean of the Institute appoints the members of the Institute TAM.  Each TAM is advisory and makes recommendations to the appropriate office in the programs for which it is responsible.\n\nThe Vermont TAM is chaired by the Director of Public Safety, and ordinarily consists of representatives (or their designees) from the Department of Public Safety, Academic Affairs, Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of the College Office, Office of the Chief Risk Officer, Human Resources, and a clinical psychologist from the Parton Center for Health and Wellness.\n\nThe Institute TAM is co-chaired by the Associate Dean of Student Services and the Executive Assistant to the Vice President.  Ordinarily, the Institute TAM consists of representatives from Advising, Career, Student Services, Human Resources, Information Technology Services, Communications, the Institute campus security, and the VP’s office.\n\n<table style=\"margin: 2% auto;\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"4\" width=\"622\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\nVermont TAM\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"120\">\n\nContact\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"264\">\n\nTitle\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"152\">\n\nEmail\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"87\">\n\nPhone\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"120\" valign=\"top\">\n\nLisa Burchard\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"264\" valign=\"top\">\n\nSpecial Projects / Public Safety\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"152\" valign=\"top\">\n\n<span>[eburchard@middlebury.edu](mailto:eburchard@middlebury.edu)</span>\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"87\" valign=\"top\">\n\n802.443.5241\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"120\" valign=\"top\">\n\nDan Gaiotti\n\nKeith Ellery\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"264\" valign=\"top\">\n\nInterim Dir. of Public Safety\n\nAssoc.

Introduction &#x26; Purpose</strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury is committed to maintaining campus and workplace environments that are safe and secure for all students, staff, faculty, and visitors. As part of this commitment, Middlebury has established two Threat Assessment and Management Teams (“TAM”), which are empowered to assess risk and, in cooperation with other Middlebury teams or offices as appropriate, formulate an appropriate response in situations where an individual’s behavior and/or statements indicate they may present a threat to the health or safety of others.  The Vermont TAM is responsible for all the programs based in Vermont and elsewhere except that the Institute TAM is responsible for the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. The TAMs seek to mitigate potential risks before they result in harm.</p>\n<p>Nothing in this policy shall be construed to alter or amend other applicable Middlebury policies.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"tam\" id=\"tam\"></a>II.

Position Statement**\n\nMiddlebury is committed to ensuring equal access to its programs and activities for qualified individuals, including individuals with disabilities.  Therefore, Middlebury supports the standards set forth in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, as amended, and similar state laws (hereinafter \"applicable law\" or \"law[s]\"), which are designed to eliminate discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities. Disabilities may include physical or mental impairments which substantially limit one or more of a person's major life activities, and which necessitate modifications to Middlebury’s facilities, programs, or services. Middlebury is committed to making reasonable accommodations for qualifying students, faculty, and employees with disabilities as required by applicable laws. Middlebury is committed to making the campus and its facilities accessible as required by applicable laws. Middlebury cannot make accommodations that are unreasonable, unduly burdensome or that fundamentally alter the nature of its programs or services.\n\n<a name=\"nature\" id=\"nature\"></a>**B. Nature and Scope of Policy**\n\nMiddlebury’s Position and Policy are intended to be co-extensive with the requirements of applicable laws; nothing in this policy is intended to provide less substantive benefits or procedural protections than are required by these laws. Likewise, nothing in this policy is intended to provide greater substantive benefits or procedural protections than are required by these laws. Middlebury’s ADA Policy and Procedures may have limited or no applicability to Middlebury’s study abroad or other programs operated outside the United States. However, practical considerations of style and a desire to present information to the Middlebury community in a useful, efficient manner dictate that the precise wording of these laws is not restated verbatim in all provisions of this policy.\n\nTherefore, the specific language of such laws and controlling interpretations thereof are incorporated by reference herein, and in the event of any apparent discrepancy between the language of this policy and such legal authority, Middlebury’s obligations will be determined exclusively by the latter.\n\n<a name=\"admission\" id=\"admission\"></a>**C. Admission for Students with Disabilities**\n\nMiddlebury College is committed to providing equal access to students with disabilities and welcomes applications from students with disabilities. An applicant’s self-identification of disabilities is at the option of the applicant and is not required.\n\n<a name=\"ada\" id=\"ada\"></a>**D. ADA Coordinators**\n\nMiddlebury has established a process to facilitate the reasonable accommodation of students with disabilities. Middlebury’s ADA Coordinator(s) certify eligibility for accommodation under the ADA for students presenting documented evidence of qualifying disabilities (including qualifying physical disabilities, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorders, psychological disabilities, medical disabilities, and covered students in drug or alcohol recovery), and reviews and acts upon all student requests for reasonable accommodations based on an individualized assessment of each request. The ADA Coordinator reserves the right to recommend and approve accommodations that differ from the specific approaches suggested by the student, or by individuals documenting the student's disability, so long as the accommodations achieve the objective of program accessibility as required by law.\n\nThe ADA Coordinator(s), in consultation with appropriate campus personnel, coordinates and facilitates the implementation of accommodations that have been deemed reasonable and appropriate in light of the nature of a student's disability and in consideration of the individual's academic requirements. Examples include the coordination and administration of ADA-related note-taking, reader, scribe, and interpreter services and ADA equipment services. The ADA Coordinator also serves as a liaison between students, faculty, staff, Facilities Services, the Admissions Office, the Office of Learning Resources, Residential Life, Commons Administration and Deans, Parton Center for Health and Wellness, Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of the College, Language School deans, Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of Schools, program directors, College Advancement, Media Services, and ITS. The ADA Coordinator is the primary intake person and decision-maker for ADA-related issues and may also be able to provide information on ADA-related issues to members of the campus and local community.\n\n<a name=\"section\" id=\"section\"></a>**E. Section 504 Coordinator**\n\nMiddlebury designates the [Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/health-wellness-education-and-safety/campus-policies/human-relations-officer) to coordinate its efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973\\. Section 504, where applicable, generally prohibits discrimination in educational programs and employment, against qualified individuals with disabilities, on the basis of disability. See also Middlebury’s [Nondiscrimination Statement](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/general/nondiscrimination).\n\n<a name=\"accom-miis\" id=\"accom-miis\"></a>**F. Accommodations at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey**\n\nThe Middlebury Institute has separate policies and procedures for qualified students with disabilities who seek reasonable accommodations. Middlebury Institute students seeking accommodations should contact the Institute’s [Office of Student Services](https://www.miis.edu/student-life/contact). [The Institute’s ADA policies and procedures](https://www.miis.edu/student-life/health-wellness/disability-services) are available on the Disability Services webpage.\n\n<a name=\"accom-empl\" id=\"accom-empl\"></a>**G. Accommodations for Employees**\n\nFaculty, staff, and other Middlebury employees who have ADA related concerns are assisted by Human Resources. For more information regarding the process by which employees can seek accommodations see [“Middlebury College Human Resources Procedures: ADA Compliance.”](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee)\n\n<a name=\"accessibility\" id=\"accessibility\"></a>**H. Accessibility of Campus Events and Programs**\n\nMiddlebury will make its campus programs and events reasonably accessible to individuals with disabilities. Any individual, including visitors to campus, who requires an accommodation should contact the program planner or the events scheduling office at least ten days in advance of the event. Students may also contact the Disability Resource Center (DRC). Middlebury cannot ensure reasonable accommodations on less than 10 days notice.\n\n**<a name=\"web\" id=\"web\"></a>I. Web Accessibility**\n\nMiddlebury is committed to taking reasonable measures to support the accessibility of its digital resources, including its Information Technology Services (ITS), such as digital hardware, software, and systems for use by students, employees and/or the general public. Students who seek an accommodation based on a disability regarding access to ITS should contact DRC. Other individuals should contact Information Technology Services.\n\nMiddlebury offices conducting core academic and business activities are strongly encouraged to align web content with the guidelines of the most current version of [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) (WCAG 2.0 AA)\n\n## II. STUDENT ACCOMMODATION PROCEDURES\n\n**<a name=\"certification\" id=\"certification\"></a>A. Certification and Accommodation**\n\nMiddlebury has adopted the following two-stage process for making reasonable accommodations to promote the accessibility of its courses, programs, goods, services, facilities, privileges, and advantages for students with qualifying disabilities:\n\n_1\\. Certification_  \na.  Students are asked to complete an Accommodation Request Form on the [the DRC website](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/diversity-inclusivity/american-disability-act). The form requires, among other things:\n\n_i._ a description of the disability, including the manner in which the disability limits major life activities relevant to a student's participation in Middlebury's programs;\n\n_ii._ a description of the specific accommodations requested.\n\nb. The form must be accompanied by documentation from an objective professional qualified to diagnose the student’s disability. Documentation should confirm the diagnosis and verify the manner in which the disability limits major life activities relevant to a student's participation in Middlebury's programs (see Section D: Documentation).\n\nc. The Accommodation Request Form and required documentation should be submitted to Disbility Resource Center immediately in order to facilitate the completion of the accommodation process in as timely a manner.\n\nd. An ADA Coordinator reviews the request for accommodation, and the accompanying documentation and will make one of the following determinations:\n\n_i._ certifies the student as a person with a disability under the ADA; or\n\n_ii._ finds that there is insufficient evidence to certify the student's eligibility, and\n\n(a) denies the student's request for certification and informs the student of the available channels of appeal; or\n\n(b) requests additional information.\n\n_2\\. Accommodation_\n\nOnce a student has been certified as a person with a disability, the ADA Coordinator:\n\na. reviews the student's request for accommodation(s);\n\nb. engages in the interactive process with the student, and other appropriate members of the Middlebury community as applicable;\n\nc. approves, denies, or offers an alternative accommodation;\n\nd. the student may appeal the decision of an ADA Coordinator regarding certification and/or accommodation(s) through the Appeals Process described in [Section E](///C:/Users/mcdurfee/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/R7Z1LC5T/ADA%20Policy%20HSR%20final%20CLEAN.docx#_E._Appeals_Process) of this document.\n\n**<a name=\"role-stu\" id=\"role-stu\"></a>B. Role of the Student**\n\nStudents are expected to identify their need for accommodation(s) and suggest possible accommodations to meet their needs. It is the student's responsibility to initiate the certification process described above by submitting the [Accommodation Request Form](https://forms.middlebury.edu/student-life/doc/ada/adaarfs) and all required documentation in a timely manner.\n\nA student who has received disability certification must work cooperatively with designated staff and faculty to determine and sustain reasonable and appropriate academic accommodations. Once a written accommodation letter has been issued to the student, the student is responsible for taking reasonable steps to ensure that the approved plan is meeting their needs. Students are therefore responsible for: (1) communicating their approved accommodations with faculty; (2) keeping appointments with faculty and designated staff to avoid delays in implementation; and (3) conferring with faculty and DRC regularly regarding the effectiveness of accommodations.\n\nIf a student perceives a need for additional accommodations or for the modification of existing accommodations, the student must request, in writing, a revision of the accommodation letter. Such requests should be addressed to an ADA Coordinator.\n\nProviding proper accommodations requires timely student input. Immediate accommodations may be impossible to facilitate. Students who have received disability certification are encouraged to contact their professors at the beginning of the semester to make arrangements for the academic accommodations for which they have been approved. Such arrangements should be made at least 5 business days in advance of when the requested accommodation will be needed. It may not be possible to arrange accommodations requested on shorter notice.\n\n**<a name=\"role-fac\" id=\"role-fac\"></a>C. Role of the Faculty**\n\nThe ADA requires that:\n\n- all otherwise qualified students are provided with equal access to courses, programs, goods, services, facilities, privileges and advantages and;\n- the impact of the disability on the student's learning and/or academic performance is mitigated without fundamentally altering the nature of the courses, programs, goods, services, facilities, privileges, and advantages.\n\nAccommodations may involve modifications of the ways in which material is presented or learning is evaluated; for examples of accommodations, please visit the [DRC website](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/diversity-inclusivity/american-disability-act).  However, accommodations which fundamentally alter the nature of the courses, programs, goods, services, facilities, privileges, and advantages shall not be required of Middlebury faculty.\n\nFaculty are encouraged to communicate with DRC regarding any concerns they may have about an accommodation. <span>DRC</span> shall communicate with faculty within the limitations of privacy laws. The fact, nature, and/or extent of a disability which has been certified by <span>DRC</span> is not subject to challenge by faculty, nor may faculty review the underlying documentation of a disability without written consent of the student. <span>DRC</span> may provide faculty with information about the impact of the disability where necessary to implement the accommodations. If the faculty member disagrees with an approved accommodation, the faculty member may file an appeal pursuant to [Section E](///C:/Users/mcdurfee/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/R7Z1LC5T/ADA%20Policy%20HSR%20final%20CLEAN.docx#_3as4poj) below.\n\nFaculty also have the right to receive a status report of a student’s accommodation request and clarification of the accommodations approved by <span>DRC</span>. Also, they may suggest alternative accommodations they think more appropriate in light of the nature of the course or program. Alternative accommodations must be as appropriate and as effective in mitigating the effects of a disability as those initially approved by <span>DRC</span>. Any alternative accommodations must be approved by <span>DRC</span> before implemented in the course. Faculty are, in turn, encouraged in appropriate situations to share with <span>DRC</span> information about the course and/or program, so that <span>DRC</span> is better able to consider appropriate accommodations. A cooperative effort should meet the needs of the student to the extent appropriate without fundamentally altering the nature of the academic course and/or program to maintain compliance with applicable law.\n\nAccommodations should be implemented as soon as reasonably possible after the faculty member has received the letter of accommodation in writing from <span>DRC</span>. If no further consultation occurs between a faculty member and <span>DRC</span>, it is presumed that the accommodations will be provided as delineated in the letter of accommodation. Undue delays in the implementation of accommodations should be avoided, as they may undermine a student’s ability to fairly access the content of courses, programs, goods, services, facilities, privileges, and advantages.\n\nIf a student approaches a faculty member directly to request an accommodation related to a physical or mental impairment, the faculty member is expected to direct the student to <span>DRC.</span> A faculty member is not individually authorized to agree to provide a student with a requested accommodation.\n\n## <a name=\"documentation\" id=\"documentation\"></a>D. Documentation\n\nMiddlebury requires appropriately current documentation of any or all disabilities for which accommodation is requested, provided at the expense of the student requesting accommodation, prior to determining what services and accommodations may be undertaken for students with qualifying disabilities. Documentation of disability will be kept confidential. Since insufficient information may jeopardize the accommodations process, Middlebury reserves the right to request additional documentation considered necessary to make a determination of reasonable and appropriate accommodations. The cost of obtaining any such additional documentation shall be the student's responsibility. Middlebury also reserves the right to request an independent evaluation by a professional of its choosing. The cost of obtaining any such independent evaluation shall be Middlebury’s responsibility. Documentation supplied as part of the process of applying to Middlebury is not part of the student's permanent educational record.\n\nGenerally, documentation verifying the disability must:\n\n1\\. be prepared by an objective professional qualified in the diagnoses of such conditions;\n\n2\\. include information regarding the testing procedures followed, the instruments used to assess the disability, the test results, and a written interpretation of these results as they pertain to an educational environment and/or participation in the Middlebury's programs;\n\n3\\. reflect the individual's present level of functioning in the areas related to the particular accommodations being sought;\n\n4\\. be appropriately recent.\n\nThe ADA Coordinator determines whether the documentation submitted is adequate to certify the student as a person with a disability under the ADA, supports the requested accommodation, and whether the individual preparing the documentation is qualified to make the diagnosis at issue.\n\nWhere a student seeks accommodation for a learning disability, the student must provide professional testing and evaluation results that reflect the student's present level of processing information and present achievement level, based on comparison to the general public.\n\nThe four criteria necessary to establish a student's eligibility for learning disability adjustments or accommodations are: (1) average or above average intelligence as measured by a standardized intelligence test which includes assessment of verbal and nonverbal abilities; (2) the presence of cognitive-achievement discrepancy or an inter-cognitive discrepancy indicated by a score on a standardized test of achievement which is 1.5 standard deviations or more below the level corresponding to a student's sub-scale or full-scale IQ; (3) the presence of disorders in cognitive or sensory processing such as those related to memory, language, or attention; and (4) an absence of other primary factors leading to achievement below expectations such as visual or auditory disabilities, emotional or behavior disorders, a lack of opportunity to learn due to cultural or socio-economic circumstances, or deficiencies in intellectual ability.\n\nDocumentation verifying the learning disability must:\n\n**1.** be prepared by an objective professional qualified to diagnose a learning disability, including but not limited to a licensed physician, learning disability specialist, or psychologist;\n\n**2.** include the testing procedures followed, the instruments used to assess the disability, the test results, and a written interpretation of the test results by the professional;\n\n**3.** reflect the individual's present level of functioning in the achievement areas of: reading comprehension, reading rate, written expression, writing mechanics and vocabulary, writing, grammar, and spelling; and\n\n**4.** reflect the individual's present level of functioning in the areas of intelligence and processing skills; and\n\n**5.** be appropriately recent.\n\nThe assessment must provide data that supports the requests for any academic adjustment. In the event that a student requests an academic adjustment or accommodation that is not supported by the data in the assessment, or if the initial verification is incomplete or inadequate to determine the extent of the disability, then it is incumbent on the student to obtain supplemental testing or assessment at the student's expense.\n\nIf Middlebury requires an additional assessment for purposes of obtaining a second professional opinion, then Middlebury shall be responsible for any cost not covered by any third party payer.\n\n## <a name=\"appeals\" id=\"appeals\"></a>E. Appeals Process\n\nThe President of Middlebury appoints an ADA Appellate Officer who decides appeals of ADA decisions when students, faculty, or staff cannot resolve the dispute. Currently, the Vice President for Academic Affairs/Dean of Faculty serves as the Appellate Officer. The Appellate Officer shall be recused where a conflict of interest exists or when the Appellate Officer otherwise has reason not to review a particular case. The Appellate Officer shall appoint a substitute in such cases.\n\nA student or faculty member may appeal any written decision of the ADA Coordinator to the Appellate Officer. All appeals shall be submitted in writing to the Appellate Officer within five business days after the student or faculty member receives written notification of the challenged decision. A copy of the appeal shall also be submitted to <span>DRC</span>. <span>DRC</span> shall provide any additional documents or information requested by the Appellate Officer in writing. All parties are encouraged to submit a complete statement, together with evidence and/or arguments that support their position.\n\nIn reaching a decision, the Appellate Officer may, at their discretion, rely solely on information supplied by the parties. Meetings shall be conducted only at the discretion of the Appellate Officer, and the nature of any such meetings shall be at the discretion of the Appellate Officer.\n\nAll appeals shall be decided as soon as possible, but generally in a time period not to exceed five days from the Appellate Officer's receipt of all information from the parties, and the completion of meetings. The Appellate Officer may extend this time period, if necessary.\n\nAn ADA Coordinator may, at their discretion, provide temporary accommodations, pending an appeal. The Appellate Officer does not grant temporary accommodations. The Appellate Officer shall notify the parties in writing of the appeal decision.\n\nThe Appellate Officer may: (1) remand the decision to the ADA Coordinator for reconsideration with or without recommendations (the ADA Coordinator will usually, absent extenuating circumstances, issue a decision on reconsideration within five days), (2) grant the requested relief of the appellant, including ADA certification and/or accommodations; (3) appoint another ADA Coordinator to review the matter and issue a decision, which will ordinarily occur when the original outcome was based on an abuse of discretion or (4) uphold the ADA Coordinator’s decision.\n\nThe decision made by the Appellate Officer to grant or deny the appeal is final. If the Appellate Officer grants the appeal and remands the matter to an ADA Coordinator for reconsideration or appoints another ADA Coordinator to decide the matter the decision of the ADA Coordinator in either of those circumstances is final and there is no further right of appeal.\n\nThe time periods stated herein for action on the part of the ADA Coordinator and Appellate Officer are advisory rather than mandatory, and these officials may extend the deadlines as necessary.\n\n## <a name=\"complaints\" id=\"complaints\"></a>F. Complaints regarding Disability-related Harassment or Discrimination\n\nIn addition to the above-stated appeals process regarding certification and/or accommodations decisions, students who feel that they have been harassed or discriminated against on the basis of their disability, in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the ADA, or other applicable law, are encouraged to file a complaint under [Middlebury’s Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin) (“AH/D Policy”). Complaints should be directed to a [Human Relations Officer](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/health-wellness-education-and-safety/campus-policies/human-relations-officer) and will be handled in accordance with the procedures set forth in the AH/D policy.\n\n## <a name=\"stu-records\" id=\"stu-records\"></a>G. Student Records\n\nRecords pertaining to a student are disposed of seven (7) years after the student's graduation or seven years from the student's last contact with the <span>DRC</span> after leaving Middlebury. Students may stipulate that information may not be discussed with their parents without the student's written release.\n\n## III. Accommodations\n\n## <a name=\"academic-accom\" id=\"academic-accom\"></a>A. Academic Accommodations\n\nAcademic accommodations are intended to preserve essential academic program requirements while minimizing the effect of a certified disability upon a student's performance. For examples, please visit the [DRC website](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/diversity-inclusivity/american-disability-act) online. These examples are not intended to be exhaustive, or appropriate in all cases; each student's needs are individually assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## <a name=\"housing-accom\" id=\"housing-accom\"></a>B. Housing Accommodations\n\nThe ADA Coordinator works in collaboration with appropriate staff to arrange for reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities living in the residence halls. Live-in professional staff may be notified in advance of students with disabilities for whom residential accommodations have been approved. Middlebury encourages regular communication between students with disabilities and appropriate staff. It is the responsibility of the student to consult with Middlebury staff if there is a need to revise or modify the measures taken to accommodate the student's needs. Students who require quiet floor housing may request such accommodations through the <span>DRC</span>.\n\nStudents requesting a single room as an accommodation are advised that such requests will be determined on an individual case by case basis. Requests should be submitted in a timely manner prior to room draw and be supported by documentation which recommends a single room and explains why a single room is needed as an accommodation given the specific nature of the student's disability. An ADA Coordinator will work in conjunction with appropriate staff to determine room assignments for eligible students.\n\nAssignments are made on the basis of availability of space and the level of need. In order to maximize Middlebury’s ability to grant such requests, notification for undergraduate students is requested by March 1st for the following academic year. Students who plan attend other Middlebury programs should notify the <span>DRC</span> of their need for housing accommodations upon enrollment. Requests made after this date may be more difficult to fulfill. The ADA Coordinator reserves the right to suggest alternative accommodations where appropriate to satisfy the request.\n\nStudents requesting an air conditioner as an accommodation are advised that such requests should be made in accordance with the guidelines established in Middlebury’s [Thermal Comfort Policy](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/thermal_comfort.).\n\nStudents are expected to play a substantial role in specifying their needs and following through on arrangements for accommodations. It must be understood that arrangements for equipment, housing assignments, and other accommodations require advance notice.\n\n## <a name=\"dining-accom\" id=\"dining-accom\"></a>C. Dining Accommodations\n\nTo initiate the process for dining related accommodations, students must fill out an [Accommodation Request Form (ARF)](https://forms.middlebury.edu/student-life/doc/ada/adaarfs) online or contact the [DRC](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/diversity-inclusivity/american-disability-act) to obtain an alternative format of the form. The information that students provide regarding any need for accommodation(s) will be shared only with those individuals involved in the coordination and facilitation of services and accommodations that are required to make Middlebury’s programs accessible.\n\n## <a name=\"provisional\" id=\"provisional\"></a>D. Provisional Accommodations\n\nAt the discretion of the ADA Coordinator, a student may be denied or granted provisional services pending submission of documentation and official certification. Absent extenuating circumstances such services will not be provided for more than one semester. The nature of provisional services will be determined at the discretion of the ADA Coordinator. Provisional services do not grant a student the status or rights of a student with a qualifying or certified disability, and it must be understood by students that a short-term grant of provisional services does not guarantee the continuation of such services or affect the ADA Coordinator’s decision as to whether requested or provisional services are reasonable accommodations.\n\n## <a name=\"assistance\" id=\"assistance\"></a>IV. ASSISTANCE FOR STUDENTS WITH TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS\n\nIn keeping with Middlebury’s commitment to supporting students, the Center for Disability Resources (DRC) may be able to arrange limited assistance for temporarily impaired students at the discretion of the <span>DRC</span> and other Middlebury offices or programs. It must be understood that the <span>DRC</span> voluntarily providing or arranging such help does not mean the temporarily injured or impaired students qualify as individuals with a disability under the law or this policy. If you have questions about what assistance Middlebury may be able to provide in the event of a temporary impairment, contact the <span>DRC</span>.\n\n_Updated on September 9, 2019._\n","excerpt":"Table of Contents I.

INTRODUCTION</h2>\n<p><a name=\"position\" id=\"position\"></a><strong>A. Position Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury is committed to ensuring equal access to its programs and activities for qualified individuals, including individuals with disabilities.  Therefore, Middlebury supports the standards set forth in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, as amended, and similar state laws (hereinafter \"applicable law\" or \"law[s]\"), which are designed to eliminate discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities. Disabilities may include physical or mental impairments which substantially limit one or more of a person's major life activities, and which necessitate modifications to Middlebury’s facilities, programs, or services. Middlebury is committed to making reasonable accommodations for qualifying students, faculty, and employees with disabilities as required by applicable laws. Middlebury is committed to making the campus and its facilities accessible as required by applicable laws. Middlebury cannot make accommodations that are unreasonable, unduly burdensome or that fundamentally alter the nature of its programs or services.</p>\n<p><a name=\"nature\" id=\"nature\"></a><strong>B. Nature and Scope of Policy</strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury’s Position and Policy are intended to be co-extensive with the requirements of applicable laws; nothing in this policy is intended to provide less substantive benefits or procedural protections than are required by these laws. Likewise, nothing in this policy is intended to provide greater substantive benefits or procedural protections than are required by these laws. Middlebury’s ADA Policy and Procedures may have limited or no applicability to Middlebury’s study abroad or other programs operated outside the United States. However, practical considerations of style and a desire to present information to the Middlebury community in a useful, efficient manner dictate that the precise wording of these laws is not restated verbatim in all provisions of this policy.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the specific language of such laws and controlling interpretations thereof are incorporated by reference herein, and in the event of any apparent discrepancy between the language of this policy and such legal authority, Middlebury’s obligations will be determined exclusively by the latter.</p>\n<p><a name=\"admission\" id=\"admission\"></a><strong>C. Admission for Students with Disabilities</strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury College is committed to providing equal access to students with disabilities and welcomes applications from students with disabilities. An applicant’s self-identification of disabilities is at the option of the applicant and is not required.</p>\n<p><a name=\"ada\" id=\"ada\"></a><strong>D. ADA Coordinators</strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury has established a process to facilitate the reasonable accommodation of students with disabilities. Middlebury’s ADA Coordinator(s) certify eligibility for accommodation under the ADA for students presenting documented evidence of qualifying disabilities (including qualifying physical disabilities, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorders, psychological disabilities, medical disabilities, and covered students in drug or alcohol recovery), and reviews and acts upon all student requests for reasonable accommodations based on an individualized assessment of each request. The ADA Coordinator reserves the right to recommend and approve accommodations that differ from the specific approaches suggested by the student, or by individuals documenting the student's disability, so long as the accommodations achieve the objective of program accessibility as required by law.</p>\n<p>The ADA Coordinator(s), in consultation with appropriate campus personnel, coordinates and facilitates the implementation of accommodations that have been deemed reasonable and appropriate in light of the nature of a student's disability and in consideration of the individual's academic requirements. Examples include the coordination and administration of ADA-related note-taking, reader, scribe, and interpreter services and ADA equipment services. The ADA Coordinator also serves as a liaison between students, faculty, staff, Facilities Services, the Admissions Office, the Office of Learning Resources, Residential Life, Commons Administration and Deans, Parton Center for Health and Wellness, Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of the College, Language School deans, Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of Schools, program directors, College Advancement, Media Services, and ITS. The ADA Coordinator is the primary intake person and decision-maker for ADA-related issues and may also be able to provide information on ADA-related issues to members of the campus and local community.</p>\n<p><a name=\"section\" id=\"section\"></a><strong>E. Section 504 Coordinator</strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury designates the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/health-wellness-education-and-safety/campus-policies/human-relations-officer\">Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator</a> to coordinate its efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 504, where applicable, generally prohibits discrimination in educational programs and employment, against qualified individuals with disabilities, on the basis of disability.

Accessibility of Campus Events and Programs</strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury will make its campus programs and events reasonably accessible to individuals with disabilities. Any individual, including visitors to campus, who requires an accommodation should contact the program planner or the events scheduling office at least ten days in advance of the event. Students may also contact the Disability Resource Center (DRC). Middlebury cannot ensure reasonable accommodations on less than 10 days notice.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"web\" id=\"web\"></a>I. Web Accessibility</strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury is committed to taking reasonable measures to support the accessibility of its digital resources, including its Information Technology Services (ITS), such as digital hardware, software, and systems for use by students, employees and/or the general public. Students who seek an accommodation based on a disability regarding access to ITS should contact DRC. Other individuals should contact Information Technology Services.</p>\n<p>Middlebury offices conducting core academic and business activities are strongly encouraged to align web content with the guidelines of the most current version of <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 Level AA</a> (WCAG 2.0 AA)</p>\n<h2>II. STUDENT ACCOMMODATION PROCEDURES</h2>\n<p><strong><a name=\"certification\" id=\"certification\"></a>A. Certification and Accommodation</strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury has adopted the following two-stage process for making reasonable accommodations to promote the accessibility of its courses, programs, goods, services, facilities, privileges, and advantages for students with qualifying disabilities:</p>\n<p><em>1. Certification</em><br>\na.  Students are asked to complete an Accommodation Request Form on the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/diversity-inclusivity/american-disability-act\">the DRC website</a>. The form requires, among other things:</p>\n<p><em>i.</em> a description of the disability, including the manner in which the disability limits major life activities relevant to a student's participation in Middlebury's programs;</p>\n<p><em>ii.</em> a description of the specific accommodations requested.</p>\n<p>b. The form must be accompanied by documentation from an objective professional qualified to diagnose the student’s disability. Documentation should confirm the diagnosis and verify the manner in which the disability limits major life activities relevant to a student's participation in Middlebury's programs (see Section D: Documentation).</p>\n<p>c. The Accommodation Request Form and required documentation should be submitted to Disbility Resource Center immediately in order to facilitate the completion of the accommodation process in as timely a manner.</p>\n<p>d. An ADA Coordinator reviews the request for accommodation, and the accompanying documentation and will make one of the following determinations:</p>\n<p><em>i.</em> certifies the student as a person with a disability under the ADA; or</p>\n<p><em>ii.</em> finds that there is insufficient evidence to certify the student's eligibility, and</p>\n<p>(a) denies the student's request for certification and informs the student of the available channels of appeal; or</p>\n<p>(b) requests additional information.</p>\n<p><em>2. Accommodation</em></p>\n<p>Once a student has been certified as a person with a disability, the ADA Coordinator:</p>\n<p>a. reviews the student's request for accommodation(s);</p>\n<p>b. engages in the interactive process with the student, and other appropriate members of the Middlebury community as applicable;</p>\n<p>c. approves, denies, or offers an alternative accommodation;</p>\n<p>d. the student may appeal the decision of an ADA Coordinator regarding certification and/or accommodation(s) through the Appeals Process described in <a href=\"///C:/Users/mcdurfee/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/R7Z1LC5T/ADA%20Policy%20HSR%20final%20CLEAN.docx#_E._Appeals_Process\">Section E</a> of this document.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"role-stu\" id=\"role-stu\"></a>B. Role of the Student</strong></p>\n<p>Students are expected to identify their need for accommodation(s) and suggest possible accommodations to meet their needs. It is the student's responsibility to initiate the certification process described above by submitting the <a href=\"https://forms.middlebury.edu/student-life/doc/ada/adaarfs\">Accommodation Request Form</a> and all required documentation in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>A student who has received disability certification must work cooperatively with designated staff and faculty to determine and sustain reasonable and appropriate academic accommodations. Once a written accommodation letter has been issued to the student, the student is responsible for taking reasonable steps to ensure that the approved plan is meeting their needs. Students are therefore responsible for: (1) communicating their approved accommodations with faculty; (2) keeping appointments with faculty and designated staff to avoid delays in implementation; and (3) conferring with faculty and DRC regularly regarding the effectiveness of accommodations.</p>\n<p>If a student perceives a need for additional accommodations or for the modification of existing accommodations, the student must request, in writing, a revision of the accommodation letter. Such requests should be addressed to an ADA Coordinator.</p>\n<p>Providing proper accommodations requires timely student input. Immediate accommodations may be impossible to facilitate. Students who have received disability certification are encouraged to contact their professors at the beginning of the semester to make arrangements for the academic accommodations for which they have been approved. Such arrangements should be made at least 5 business days in advance of when the requested accommodation will be needed. It may not be possible to arrange accommodations requested on shorter notice.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"role-fac\" id=\"role-fac\"></a>C. Role of the Faculty</strong></p>\n<p>The ADA requires that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>all otherwise qualified students are provided with equal access to courses, programs, goods, services, facilities, privileges and advantages and;</li>\n<li>the impact of the disability on the student's learning and/or academic performance is mitigated without fundamentally altering the nature of the courses, programs, goods, services, facilities, privileges, and advantages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Accommodations may involve modifications of the ways in which material is presented or learning is evaluated; for examples of accommodations, please visit the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/diversity-inclusivity/american-disability-act\">DRC website</a>.  However, accommodations which fundamentally alter the nature of the courses, programs, goods, services, facilities, privileges, and advantages shall not be required of Middlebury faculty.</p>\n<p>Faculty are encouraged to communicate with DRC regarding any concerns they may have about an accommodation. <span>DRC</span> shall communicate with faculty within the limitations of privacy laws. The fact, nature, and/or extent of a disability which has been certified by <span>DRC</span> is not subject to challenge by faculty, nor may faculty review the underlying documentation of a disability without written consent of the student. <span>DRC</span> may provide faculty with information about the impact of the disability where necessary to implement the accommodations. If the faculty member disagrees with an approved accommodation, the faculty member may file an appeal pursuant to <a href=\"///C:/Users/mcdurfee/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/R7Z1LC5T/ADA%20Policy%20HSR%20final%20CLEAN.docx#_3as4poj\">Section E</a> below.</p>\n<p>Faculty also have the right to receive a status report of a student’s accommodation request and clarification of the accommodations approved by <span>DRC</span>. Also, they may suggest alternative accommodations they think more appropriate in light of the nature of the course or program. Alternative accommodations must be as appropriate and as effective in mitigating the effects of a disability as those initially approved by <span>DRC</span>. Any alternative accommodations must be approved by <span>DRC</span> before implemented in the course. Faculty are, in turn, encouraged in appropriate situations to share with <span>DRC</span> information about the course and/or program, so that <span>DRC</span> is better able to consider appropriate accommodations. A cooperative effort should meet the needs of the student to the extent appropriate without fundamentally altering the nature of the academic course and/or program to maintain compliance with applicable law.</p>\n<p>Accommodations should be implemented as soon as reasonably possible after the faculty member has received the letter of accommodation in writing from <span>DRC</span>. If no further consultation occurs between a faculty member and <span>DRC</span>, it is presumed that the accommodations will be provided as delineated in the letter of accommodation. Undue delays in the implementation of accommodations should be avoided, as they may undermine a student’s ability to fairly access the content of courses, programs, goods, services, facilities, privileges, and advantages.</p>\n<p>If a student approaches a faculty member directly to request an accommodation related to a physical or mental impairment, the faculty member is expected to direct the student to <span>DRC.</span> A faculty member is not individually authorized to agree to provide a student with a requested accommodation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"documentation\" id=\"documentation\"></a>D. Documentation</h2>\n<p>Middlebury requires appropriately current documentation of any or all disabilities for which accommodation is requested, provided at the expense of the student requesting accommodation, prior to determining what services and accommodations may be undertaken for students with qualifying disabilities. Documentation of disability will be kept confidential. Since insufficient information may jeopardize the accommodations process, Middlebury reserves the right to request additional documentation considered necessary to make a determination of reasonable and appropriate accommodations. The cost of obtaining any such additional documentation shall be the student's responsibility. Middlebury also reserves the right to request an independent evaluation by a professional of its choosing. The cost of obtaining any such independent evaluation shall be Middlebury’s responsibility. Documentation supplied as part of the process of applying to Middlebury is not part of the student's permanent educational record.</p>\n<p>Generally, documentation verifying the disability must:</p>\n<p>1. be prepared by an objective professional qualified in the diagnoses of such conditions;</p>\n<p>2. include information regarding the testing procedures followed, the instruments used to assess the disability, the test results, and a written interpretation of these results as they pertain to an educational environment and/or participation in the Middlebury's programs;</p>\n<p>3. reflect the individual's present level of functioning in the areas related to the particular accommodations being sought;</p>\n<p>4. be appropriately recent.</p>\n<p>The ADA Coordinator determines whether the documentation submitted is adequate to certify the student as a person with a disability under the ADA, supports the requested accommodation, and whether the individual preparing the documentation is qualified to make the diagnosis at issue.</p>\n<p>Where a student seeks accommodation for a learning disability, the student must provide professional testing and evaluation results that reflect the student's present level of processing information and present achievement level, based on comparison to the general public.</p>\n<p>The four criteria necessary to establish a student's eligibility for learning disability adjustments or accommodations are: (1) average or above average intelligence as measured by a standardized intelligence test which includes assessment of verbal and nonverbal abilities; (2) the presence of cognitive-achievement discrepancy or an inter-cognitive discrepancy indicated by a score on a standardized test of achievement which is 1.5 standard deviations or more below the level corresponding to a student's sub-scale or full-scale IQ; (3) the presence of disorders in cognitive or sensory processing such as those related to memory, language, or attention; and (4) an absence of other primary factors leading to achievement below expectations such as visual or auditory disabilities, emotional or behavior disorders, a lack of opportunity to learn due to cultural or socio-economic circumstances, or deficiencies in intellectual ability.</p>\n<p>Documentation verifying the learning disability must:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> be prepared by an objective professional qualified to diagnose a learning disability, including but not limited to a licensed physician, learning disability specialist, or psychologist;</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> include the testing procedures followed, the instruments used to assess the disability, the test results, and a written interpretation of the test results by the professional;</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> reflect the individual's present level of functioning in the achievement areas of: reading comprehension, reading rate, written expression, writing mechanics and vocabulary, writing, grammar, and spelling; and</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> reflect the individual's present level of functioning in the areas of intelligence and processing skills; and</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> be appropriately recent.</p>\n<p>The assessment must provide data that supports the requests for any academic adjustment. In the event that a student requests an academic adjustment or accommodation that is not supported by the data in the assessment, or if the initial verification is incomplete or inadequate to determine the extent of the disability, then it is incumbent on the student to obtain supplemental testing or assessment at the student's expense.</p>\n<p>If Middlebury requires an additional assessment for purposes of obtaining a second professional opinion, then Middlebury shall be responsible for any cost not covered by any third party payer.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"appeals\" id=\"appeals\"></a>E. Appeals Process</h2>\n<p>The President of Middlebury appoints an ADA Appellate Officer who decides appeals of ADA decisions when students, faculty, or staff cannot resolve the dispute. Currently, the Vice President for Academic Affairs/Dean of Faculty serves as the Appellate Officer. The Appellate Officer shall be recused where a conflict of interest exists or when the Appellate Officer otherwise has reason not to review a particular case. The Appellate Officer shall appoint a substitute in such cases.</p>\n<p>A student or faculty member may appeal any written decision of the ADA Coordinator to the Appellate Officer. All appeals shall be submitted in writing to the Appellate Officer within five business days after the student or faculty member receives written notification of the challenged decision. A copy of the appeal shall also be submitted to <span>DRC</span>. <span>DRC</span> shall provide any additional documents or information requested by the Appellate Officer in writing. All parties are encouraged to submit a complete statement, together with evidence and/or arguments that support their position.</p>\n<p>In reaching a decision, the Appellate Officer may, at their discretion, rely solely on information supplied by the parties. Meetings shall be conducted only at the discretion of the Appellate Officer, and the nature of any such meetings shall be at the discretion of the Appellate Officer.</p>\n<p>All appeals shall be decided as soon as possible, but generally in a time period not to exceed five days from the Appellate Officer's receipt of all information from the parties, and the completion of meetings. The Appellate Officer may extend this time period, if necessary.</p>\n<p>An ADA Coordinator may, at their discretion, provide temporary accommodations, pending an appeal. The Appellate Officer does not grant temporary accommodations. The Appellate Officer shall notify the parties in writing of the appeal decision.</p>\n<p>The Appellate Officer may: (1) remand the decision to the ADA Coordinator for reconsideration with or without recommendations (the ADA Coordinator will usually, absent extenuating circumstances, issue a decision on reconsideration within five days), (2) grant the requested relief of the appellant, including ADA certification and/or accommodations; (3) appoint another ADA Coordinator to review the matter and issue a decision, which will ordinarily occur when the original outcome was based on an abuse of discretion or (4) uphold the ADA Coordinator’s decision.</p>\n<p>The decision made by the Appellate Officer to grant or deny the appeal is final. If the Appellate Officer grants the appeal and remands the matter to an ADA Coordinator for reconsideration or appoints another ADA Coordinator to decide the matter the decision of the ADA Coordinator in either of those circumstances is final and there is no further right of appeal.</p>\n<p>The time periods stated herein for action on the part of the ADA Coordinator and Appellate Officer are advisory rather than mandatory, and these officials may extend the deadlines as necessary.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"complaints\" id=\"complaints\"></a>F. Complaints regarding Disability-related Harassment or Discrimination</h2>\n<p>In addition to the above-stated appeals process regarding certification and/or accommodations decisions, students who feel that they have been harassed or discriminated against on the basis of their disability, in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the ADA, or other applicable law, are encouraged to file a complaint under <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin\">Middlebury’s Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy</a> (“AH/D Policy”). Complaints should be directed to a <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/health-wellness-education-and-safety/campus-policies/human-relations-officer\">Human Relations Officer</a> and will be handled in accordance with the procedures set forth in the AH/D policy.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"stu-records\" id=\"stu-records\"></a>G. Student Records</h2>\n<p>Records pertaining to a student are disposed of seven (7) years after the student's graduation or seven years from the student's last contact with the <span>DRC</span> after leaving Middlebury. Students may stipulate that information may not be discussed with their parents without the student's written release.</p>\n<h2>III. Accommodations</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"academic-accom\" id=\"academic-accom\"></a>A. Academic Accommodations</h2>\n<p>Academic accommodations are intended to preserve essential academic program requirements while minimizing the effect of a certified disability upon a student's performance. For examples, please visit the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/diversity-inclusivity/american-disability-act\">DRC website</a> online. These examples are not intended to be exhaustive, or appropriate in all cases; each student's needs are individually assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"housing-accom\" id=\"housing-accom\"></a>B. Housing Accommodations</h2>\n<p>The ADA Coordinator works in collaboration with appropriate staff to arrange for reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities living in the residence halls. Live-in professional staff may be notified in advance of students with disabilities for whom residential accommodations have been approved. Middlebury encourages regular communication between students with disabilities and appropriate staff. It is the responsibility of the student to consult with Middlebury staff if there is a need to revise or modify the measures taken to accommodate the student's needs. Students who require quiet floor housing may request such accommodations through the <span>DRC</span>.</p>\n<p>Students requesting a single room as an accommodation are advised that such requests will be determined on an individual case by case basis. Requests should be submitted in a timely manner prior to room draw and be supported by documentation which recommends a single room and explains why a single room is needed as an accommodation given the specific nature of the student's disability. An ADA Coordinator will work in conjunction with appropriate staff to determine room assignments for eligible students.</p>\n<p>Assignments are made on the basis of availability of space and the level of need. In order to maximize Middlebury’s ability to grant such requests, notification for undergraduate students is requested by March 1st for the following academic year. Students who plan attend other Middlebury programs should notify the <span>DRC</span> of their need for housing accommodations upon enrollment. Requests made after this date may be more difficult to fulfill. The ADA Coordinator reserves the right to suggest alternative accommodations where appropriate to satisfy the request.</p>\n<p>Students requesting an air conditioner as an accommodation are advised that such requests should be made in accordance with the guidelines established in Middlebury’s <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/thermal_comfort.\">Thermal Comfort Policy</a>.</p>\n<p>Students are expected to play a substantial role in specifying their needs and following through on arrangements for accommodations. It must be understood that arrangements for equipment, housing assignments, and other accommodations require advance notice.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"dining-accom\" id=\"dining-accom\"></a>C. Dining Accommodations</h2>\n<p>To initiate the process for dining related accommodations, students must fill out an <a href=\"https://forms.middlebury.edu/student-life/doc/ada/adaarfs\">Accommodation Request Form (ARF)</a> online or contact the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/diversity-inclusivity/american-disability-act\">DRC</a> to obtain an alternative format of the form. The information that students provide regarding any need for accommodation(s) will be shared only with those individuals involved in the coordination and facilitation of services and accommodations that are required to make Middlebury’s programs accessible.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"provisional\" id=\"provisional\"></a>D. Provisional Accommodations</h2>\n<p>At the discretion of the ADA Coordinator, a student may be denied or granted provisional services pending submission of documentation and official certification. Absent extenuating circumstances such services will not be provided for more than one semester. The nature of provisional services will be determined at the discretion of the ADA Coordinator. Provisional services do not grant a student the status or rights of a student with a qualifying or certified disability, and it must be understood by students that a short-term grant of provisional services does not guarantee the continuation of such services or affect the ADA Coordinator’s decision as to whether requested or provisional services are reasonable accommodations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"assistance\" id=\"assistance\"></a>IV. ASSISTANCE FOR STUDENTS WITH TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS</h2>\n<p>In keeping with Middlebury’s commitment to supporting students, the Center for Disability Resources (DRC) may be able to arrange limited assistance for temporarily impaired students at the discretion of the <span>DRC</span> and other Middlebury offices or programs. It must be understood that the <span>DRC</span> voluntarily providing or arranging such help does not mean the temporarily injured or impaired students qualify as individuals with a disability under the law or this policy. If you have questions about what assistance Middlebury may be able to provide in the event of a temporary impairment, contact the <span>DRC</span>.</p>\n<p><em>Updated on September 9, 2019.</em></p>"},"b8a29170-2601-55fc-b512-aeefee67e2e2":{"id":"b8a29170-2601-55fc-b512-aeefee67e2e2","slug":"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy","title":"B.1.a. Non-Discrimination Policy","body":"\nMiddlebury is committed to creating and maintaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive campus environment where we value openness, curiosity, rigor, and equality. Discrimination, including harassment, is antithetical to our values and mission, and, therefore, Middlebury seeks to eradicate unlawful discrimination based on protected personal characteristics in its educational and employment environments.\n\nIndividuals who feel they have experienced discrimination, including harassment, based on a protected personal characteristic are strongly encouraged to report the behavior to our Civil Rights and Title IX Office. Middlebury provides timely services to those who have been affected by discrimination, including harassment.  It is not necessary to file a complaint with Middlebury or participate in an adjudication process in order to request “supportive measures” from Middlebury. Appropriate supportive measures may vary depending on specific facts and circumstances and will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, Middlebury provides procedures to assure prompt and equitable investigation and resolution intended to stop discrimination/harassment, remedy harms and prevent repetition.  Different types of behavior are subject to different procedures, in accordance with federal law.\n\nViolations of this Policy may result in sanctions up to and including termination, dismissal, or expulsion, as determined by the appropriate Middlebury officials. Concerns about conduct under this Policy may be resolved through informal or “adaptable” resolutions, when appropriate. Retaliation against an individual for raising an allegation of discrimination, for cooperating in an investigation of such a complaint, or for opposing discriminatory practices is prohibited. Submitting a complaint that is not in good faith or providing false or misleading information in any investigation of complaints is also prohibited. Nothing in this Policy shall be construed to abridge academic freedom and inquiry, principles of free speech, or Middlebury’s educational mission.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Scope:</span>\n\nThis Policy applies to all students, staff, faculty, applicants and visitors to Middlebury’s programs and campus.  “Middlebury” includes the undergraduate college, the Language Schools, the School of the Environment, MiddCore, Bread Loaf School of English, Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference, Middlebury College Schools Abroad, and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Types of Behavior Prohibited by Law and this Policy:</span>\n\nMembers of and visitors to the Middlebury community are prohibited from engaging in:\n\n(i) Sexual Harassment as defined by Title IX, including but not limited to sexual assault, domestic and dating violence and misconduct, sex-based stalking, and _quid pro quo_ sexual harassment;\n\n(ii) Discriminatory harassment, based on or motivated by an individual’s actual or perceived race, creed, color, place of birth, ancestry, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, disability, marital status, pregnancy or sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression (including but not limited to sexual assault, domestic and dating violence and misconduct, and stalking) not meeting the definition of Title IX Sexual Harassment, or other characteristics as defined and protected by law in the location where a particular program is operating (e.g. crime victim status in Vermont); and\n\n(iii) Discrimination in employment, or in admission or access to Middlebury’s educational or extracurricular programs, activities, benefits or facilities based on an individual’s race, creed, color, place of birth, ancestry, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, pregnancy, service in the armed forces of the United States, positive HIV-related blood test results, genetic information, or disability and/or any other status or characteristic as defined and to the extent protected by applicable law (e.g. crime victim status in Vermont).\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Defining Prohibited Conduct:</span>\n\n1\\.

[rape](#rape),\n2. [fondling](#fondling) without consent,\n3. [incest](#incest), or\n4. [statutory rape](#statutoryrape)\n\n8\\. Stalking means engaging in two or more [acts](#acts) directed at a specific person that would cause a [reasonable person](#reasonableperson) to either (i) fear for the person’s safety or the safety of others; OR (ii) suffer [substantial emotional distress](#substantialemotionaldistress).\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Other Definitions:</span>\n\nConsent means words or actions, freely and actively given by each party, which a reasonable person would interpret as a willingness to participate in agreed-upon sexual conduct.\n\nConsent is not present or valid when a person is incapable of giving consent because they are incapacitated by drugs or alcohol; when intimidation, threats, physical force, or other actions that a reasonable person in that person’s circumstances would consider coercive are applied; when that person is placed in fear that any person will suffer imminent bodily injury; when a physical or mental condition is present such that the person cannot knowingly or voluntarily give consent; or when a person is under the age of 16\\. Silence, non-communication, or a lack of resistance does not necessarily imply consent. Previous relationships or consent do not imply consent to future sexual conduct. Consent to one form of sexual activity does not imply consent to other forms of sexual activity. Consent can be rescinded at any time.\n\nThe use of alcohol or drugs does not minimize or excuse a person’s responsibility for committing sexual misconduct, or that person’s responsibility for determining whether another is capable of giving consent, as described above.\n\nCoercion means the use of unreasonable pressure to gain sexual access. Coercion is more than a momentary effort to persuade, entice, or attract another person to engage in sexual activity.  When a person makes clear a decision not to engage in sexual activity, or makes a decision to stop sexual activity, or a decision not to go beyond a certain sexual activity, continued pressure to engage can be coercive.  In evaluating whether coercion was used, the College will consider: (i) the frequency of the application of pressure; (ii) the intensity of the pressure; (iii) the degree of isolation of the person being pressured; (iv) the duration of the pressure; and (v) any other similar or related conduct.\n\n**Investigation and Resolutions Procedures.**\n\nViolations of this policy are investigated and adjudicated using the following procedures:\n\n**(A)** **Title IX Investigation & Resolutions Procedure**\n\nIn accordance with Federal law and the Title IX regulations issued in May 2020, all Title IX Sexual Harassment prohibited by this policy is investigated and adjudicated using Middlebury’s [Title IX Investigation & Resolutions Procedure](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-b-1-title-ix-investigation-resolutions-policy), which applies to:\n\n(i)  Sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking on the basis of sex, committed in an education program or activity of Middlebury in the United States;\n\n(ii) _Quid pro quo_ sexual harassment committed in an education program or activity of Middlebury in the United States by which an employee of Middlebury conditions the provision of a Middlebury aid, benefit, or service on a student’s or employee’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct; and\n\n(iii) Severe, pervasive and objectively offensive sexual harassment on the basis of sex committed in an education program or activity of Middlebury in the United States that constitutes unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a student or employee equal access to the College’s education program or activity.\n\n**(B)** **Non-Discrimination Investigations & Resolutions Procedure**\n\nAll other conduct prohibited by this policy that is not covered by Middlebury’s [Title IX Investigation & Resolutions Procedure](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-b-1-title-ix-investigation-resolutions-policy) is investigated and adjudicated using Middlebury’s Non-Discrimination Investigation & Resolutions Procedure.\n\n**(C)** **General Conduct Procedures**.\n\nMiddlebury prohibits other violent, threatening or exploitative conduct, some of which may have been included in previous versions of Middlebury’s SMDVS Policy, but for which the respondent need not be motivated by an individual’s actual or perceived protected status in order for a violation to be found, such as dating misconduct and sexual exploitation, through its conduct policies for students, staff and faculty.\n\n**Amnesty**\n\nMiddlebury encourages the reporting of all concerns regarding harassment and discrimination. Sometimes individuals are hesitant to report such instances because they fear they may be charged with other policy violations, such as underage alcohol consumption. While not condoning infractions of any kind, to encourage reporting, Middlebury may, where appropriate, offer leniency with respect to other policy violations that may be revealed as a result of a report, particularly those involving underage drinking or drug use. The nature and scope of the leniency will depend on the particular circumstances involved. Individuals should understand that the use of alcohol or drugs never makes them at fault for instances of harassment or discrimination committed against them, nor does it mitigate accountability for committing such violations against another.\n\n**Confidentiality**\n\nMiddlebury will treat information it has received with appropriate sensitivity and care and will endeavor to protect the privacy of the individuals to the extent it can do so, consistent with its obligations to respond to reports of violations of its policies.  More detailed information on confidentiality can be found in the appropriate Procedure.\n\n---\n\n## Glossary of Terms\n\n**<a name=\"acts\" id=\"acts\"></a>Acts** – Acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person’s property.\n\n**<a name=\"datingviolence\" id=\"datingviolence\"></a>Dating violence** – For the purposes of this definition, dating violence includes, but is not limited to, sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse, if involving individuals who are or have been dating as defined here, and violence means conduct that involves the use or threatened use of physical force against a person, or creates a reasonable belief that physical force may be used against a person in the course of the conduct.

Individuals who have experienced Title IX Sexual Harassment may be eligible to pursue Orders of Protection, Restraining Orders and/or Relief from Abuse Orders from courts in the United States or courts outside of the United States as applicable. Middlebury will offer its support to individuals if they request Middlebury’s assistance with making contact with law enforcement authorities and other external resources to seek such orders. Middlebury will respect such orders to the extent applicable.\n\nc. Assistance by Middlebury\n\nRequests for assistance with contacting law enforcement authorities or obtaining an Order of Protection, a Relief from Abuse Order, a Restraining Order or other lawful order may be made in person, via email, phone or teleconference to the CRTIX Coordinator, an HRO, or Public Safety For additional information regarding making reports to the police and/or obtaining an Order of Protection, Restraining Order, or Relief from Abuse Order.\n\n## 3.    What This Procedure Covers \n\nThis Non-Discrimination Investigations & Resolutions Procedure is intended to address instances of prohibited discrimination, including sexual harassment and other harassment, as defined in Middlebury’s Non-Discrimination Policy that are not required by the Department of Education to be handled under Middlebury’s Title IX Investigation & Resolutions Procedure.\n\nMiddlebury may, in exceptional circumstances, vary from this Procedure. So long as such a variation is consistent with relevant law and allows for fundamental fairness in the processes followed, variations from this process under those circumstances will not invalidate an outcome.\n\nMiddlebury complies with all applicable provisions of state and federal law which prohibit discrimination in employment, or in admission or access to its educational or extracurricular programs, activities, or facilities. With respect to Middlebury programs operating in states other than Vermont (e.g., California, New Mexico, and Washington D.C.), discrimination shall be defined as stated in the Non-Discrimination Policy unless the local law applicable to the program at issue mandates a broader definition, in which case such law will apply.\n\n## 4.    Retaliation\n\nRetaliation against an individual for raising an allegation of discrimination, for cooperating in an investigation of such a complaint, or for opposing discriminatory practices is prohibited under the Non-Discrimination Policy.\n\n## 5.    Confidentiality\n\nCertain Middlebury employees may maintain confidentiality, but most cannot. Although strict confidentiality may therefore not be guaranteed, in all cases Middlebury will handle information in a sensitive manner and will endeavor to protect the privacy of individuals and maintain confidentiality to the extent possible consistent with its obligations to respond to reports of discrimination, harassment and/or related retaliation.\n\nThis section is intended to inform students, faculty, and staff of the various reporting and confidential disclosure options available to them, so that they can make informed choices about where to go for help.\n\na. Confidential Resources\n\nA confidential resource is an individual who is legally and ethically bound to keep confidential all information shared with them in the course of providing counsel and support, except under the circumstances noted below. Middlebury respects that the decision to come forward may be difficult and that individuals may wish to seek assistance from someone who can provide confidential information and support, and who can provide assurances that what is disclosed will not be acted on except in the circumstances outlined below. (For a list of confidential resources, see the Civil Rights and Title IX website).\n\nIn general, the law recognizes and protects the confidentiality of communications between a person seeking care and a medical or mental health professional, religious advisor or MiddSafe Advocate. The medical, mental health, religious professionals and MiddSafe advocates at Middlebury and their off-campus counterparts respect and protect confidential communications from students, faculty, and staff to the extent they are legally able to do so. These professionals may have to breach a confidence, however, when they perceive a serious risk of danger or threat to any person or property. In addition, medical and mental health professionals may be required by law to report certain crimes (e.g., any allegation of sexual and/or physical abuse of a person under 18). These exceptions to confidentiality are governed by the law of the state in which the confidential resource is located.\n\nAn individual who speaks to a confidential resource must understand that, if they want to maintain confidentiality, Middlebury will be unable to conduct an investigation into the particular incident or pursue disciplinary action against the individual who is alleged to have violated this policy.\n\nb.Non-Confidential Resources\n\nNon-confidential resources are all faculty or staff members, including ombudpersons and residential life staff who are not medical or counseling professionals, clergy, or MiddSafe Advocates, and are therefore not permitted to honor requests for confidentiality. Non-confidential faculty or staff who learn of an incident of discrimination, harassment or related retaliation involving a student are required to report that information to the HRO. (See Section B.1\\. for more information).\n\nFaculty and staff who are “[Campus Security Authorities](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/csa)” are required to report certain crimes to the Department of Public Safety for the purpose of compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act.\n\nEmployees with supervisory responsibility are expected to report all incidents of harassment, discrimination and related retaliation involving employees to the HRO and/or to Human Resources.\n\nGeneral inquiries to Middlebury officials about policies or procedures, and conversations in which the alleged wrongdoer is not identified by name or by implication from the circumstances may remain private. Otherwise, individuals who want to maintain confidentiality should seek a confidential resource.\n\nc. Confidentiality\n\nMiddlebury is responsible for providing a safe and nondiscriminatory environment for students, faculty and staff.  Outside of the Confidential Resources outlined above, Middlebury will take reasonable steps to avoid disclosure of the identity of a complainant.  Depending on a number of factors including the specifics of a concern, the identity of a complainant may become readily apparent.  Middlebury will only disclose information regarding a concern of discrimination on a need to know basis or as required to by law.\n\nd. Other Disclosures Required by Law\n\nMiddlebury will not include the names of complainants or other identifying information in publicly available reports as required by the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. In certain circumstances, Middlebury may need to report an incident to law enforcement authorities. Such circumstances include but are not limited to incidents that warrant the undertaking of safety and security measures for the protection of the individual and/or the campus community, instances involving abuse of minors, or situations in which there is clear and imminent danger and/or a weapon may be involved.\n\n---\n\n## B. Procedures for Addressing Harassment, Discrimination and Related Retaliation\n\nMiddlebury encourages individuals to report incidents of discrimination, harassment and related retaliation so that they can obtain support and information and so that Middlebury can respond appropriately.  Individuals are encouraged to report their concerns to the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator.\n\n## 1.    Reporting Requirements for Staff and Faculty\n\nAll members of Middlebury’s community are expected to promote an environment free from prohibited discrimination, harassment, including sexual harassment, and related retaliation.\n\nAny faculty or staff member who learns of an incident of discrimination, harassment, or related retaliation involving a student must report this information to a Middlebury Human Relations Officer or the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator (see [Appendix A](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin#A) for contact information), or the appropriate dean or program director in cases involving the Language Schools, Schools Abroad, Bread Loaf, the Middlebury Institute, MiddCore, School of the Environment, or other Middlebury program, as applicable, unless their status as a confidential resource precludes this disclosure. Confidential resources include the staff of the Center for Health and Wellness, the staff of the Chaplain’s Office, MiddSafe Advocates, or other medical, counseling, support or religious personnel and volunteers who are required by law to maintain confidentiality. Please see Section A.5\\. Confidentiality for more information.\n\nEmployees with supervisory responsibility must report incidents of discrimination, harassment, including sexual harassment, or retaliation, and, if directed by HR or another appropriate official, take appropriate remedial action should such matters come to their attention. Supervisors should report any complaints or suspected acts of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation (even if they do not involve direct reports) to a HRO, Human Resources, or the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator in accordance with Section 2, below. Depending upon the circumstances of a given situation, supervisors may be responsible for taking steps such as, by way of example but not limitation, addressing issues directly with staff, faculty, or students whom they supervise, facilitating informal resolution or mediation of issues, providing information on avenues to address questions of harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation, or pursuing complaints under the complaint procedures described here.\n\nFailure to report or address harassment, discrimination, or retaliation complaints or suspected acts of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation appropriately in accordance with this section may be considered a violation of Middlebury’s policy.\n\n## 2.    Complaint Procedures\n\nAny Middlebury student, faculty member, staff member or applicant (for employment or to any Middlebury program) who has reasonable cause to believe that discrimination or harassment, including sexual harassment, has occurred or is occurring, or who believes that a student, faculty member, staff member or applicant has been subjected to retaliation for having brought or supported a complaint of discrimination or harassment, is encouraged to bring that information to the immediate attention of the official who is designated to receive such reports in the Middlebury program at issue (reports or complaints can be made verbally or in writing).<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" id=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Reports may also be made to the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator or any HRO (student, faculty and staff matters), or to Human Resources (employees).\n\nIf the designated HRO is unavailable, or if the HRO has a conflict of interest, the report should be made to the designated alternate HRO for the program at issue. The alternate shall have the same authority as the designated HRO to oversee investigations and adjudicate harassment, discrimination, and retaliation complaints. The names and contact information for offices and/or individuals serving as Human Relations Officers and alternate Human Relations Officers in Middlebury’s various programs and locations are listed on the Civil Rights and Title IX website.\n\nMiddlebury encourages students, faculty, staff and applicants to report instances of unwelcome protected-characteristic-related conduct (including unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature) even if the conduct is not sufficiently severe such that it undermines and detracts from or interferes with an individual’s education, work performance, or access to Middlebury resources, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive educational, work, or living environment. Middlebury encourages such reports, including through our online form, so that the behavior can be addressed before it creates a hostile environment for the affected individual. In such instances, the HRO and/or other Middlebury officials, to the extent appropriate, will address the conduct in a manner that is reasonably calculated to prevent its reoccurrence.\n\nWhen the HRO receives actual notice – i.e., a written or oral complaint or report directed to the HRO – of conduct that may constitute prohibited discrimination or harassment (including sexual harassment) or related retaliation that may be investigated and adjudicated under this Procedure, Middlebury will initiate the following process, except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, below:\n\na. The HRO will promptly determine initially whether the report or complaint alleges conduct that is prohibited by the [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy) and whether an investigation and adjudication should proceed under this Procedure.\n\nb. If the HRO determines that the report or complaint does fall within the scope of  the [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy) and that an investigation and adjudication should proceed, a copy of the [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy) and this Procedure will be provided to the complainant and the respondent and the parties will be notified that Middlebury is investigating the possibility that the respondent has violated the [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy) using this Procedure (absent extenuating circumstances). The HRO will then, individually or in conjunction with other Middlebury offices or individuals (including, if warranted, independent investigators), promptly and equitably conduct or supervise an investigation that is appropriate under the circumstances. The investigation will be conducted in a prompt, thorough, fair, timely, equitable, and impartial manner.\n\nThe investigator is authorized to contact any and all individuals; Middlebury recognizes, however, that individuals who are bound by legal privileges may not be able to disclose privileged information, unless an exception applies. The investigator is authorized to access relevant records, except those legally protected as confidential or privileged, and may collect any additional evidence relevant to the complaint. The nature and scope of the investigation is within the sole discretion of the investigator and/or the HRO.\n\nAll witnesses identified in connection with an investigation under this Procedure are expected to cooperate fully in the investigation by providing complete, accurate, and truthful information. Middlebury policy prohibits intentionally making a false report or providing false or misleading information in any investigation under this Procedure. Complainants will not be deemed to have provided false or misleading information under this policy if their factual allegations are intended to be truthful and are made in good faith, regardless of whether the conduct complained of is ultimately found to constitute a policy violation.\n\nWitnesses may be expected to sign statements or other documents memorializing the information provided in the course of the investigation and may be asked to keep the substance of the investigation interview confidential. Failure to cooperate fully with the investigator or other Middlebury official (including but not limited to providing false information, as described above) may subject the employee or student to the full range of disciplinary actions available to the supervising authority or responsible official in accordance with the program’s existing policies and/or contracts, as applicable, up to and including termination of employment or suspension or expulsion from Middlebury.\n\nThe parties may retain legal counsel at any time, although legal counsel is not permitted to participate in Middlebury’s investigation and adjudication process under this Procedure. Attorneys who wish to communicate about a case may contact Middlebury’s legal counsel directly.\n\nIn cases where the student is a respondent, if at any point prior to or during the investigation and adjudication process, the HRO becomes aware that other Middlebury policies may have been violated in relation to the matter under investigation, these alleged policy violations may, where appropriate, also be resolved through the investigation and adjudication process in this Procedure. The decision to investigate and adjudicate other alleged policy violations is within the sole discretion of the HRO. In all cases the parties will be notified if the HRO determines that additional alleged policy violations will be investigated and adjudicated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.\n\nc. The HROs, Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator, Vice President for Academic Affairs/Dean of Faculty (“VPAA”), Human Resources Department, Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students, Vice president for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Language Schools, Dean of International Programs, RDs, public safety staff, or other supervisory authority for the program at issue (or their designees) may also at any time take appropriate steps, including by way of example only, issuance of No Contact Orders, temporary changes in assignment of duties or housing, changes in class schedules or class requirements, or other accommodations, as appropriate, to protect complaining parties on an interim basis.\n\nd. After the investigation is completed, the investigator shall issue a report to the adjudicating HRO, together with recommended findings, based on a preponderance of the evidence standard, i.e., whether it was more likely than not that the [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy) (or other Middlebury policies, if applicable) was violated. The report may be issued orally or in writing depending on the nature and complexity of the information.\n\ne. The adjudicating HRO is not bound by the investigator’s report. Rather, it is advisory to the HRO. The adjudicating HRO may accept or reject the investigator’s recommended finding in whole or in part, and may request additional relevant information before making a determination. The HRO should avoid duplicating the efforts of the investigator, as well as accepting the investigator’s recommended finding without careful review of all of the evidence.\n\nf. Either party may choose to meet individually with the adjudicating HRO prior to the HRO’s determination. The HRO may also request an individual meeting with either party or any other person(s) as appropriate.\n\ng. After review of the investigator’s report and recommended finding, the HRO shall issue a determination as to whether a violation of the [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy) occurred. The HRO’s determination will be based on a preponderance of the evidence standard, and the HRO will reach a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence presented.\n\nh. If the HRO finds that a staff or faculty member has engaged in conduct that violates the [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy) the HRO will refer the matter to the appropriate supervisory authority  (e.g., the Middlebury College VPAA or designee, Provost, the Middlebury Institute’s Chief Academic Officer or designee [“the Middlebury Institute’s CAO”], Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Language Schools, Dean of International Programs, in the case of a faculty member, as applicable to the program at issue, and/or the Middlebury College Human Resources Department, or the Middlebury Institute’s Human Resources Department, as applicable, in the case of a staff member) to take appropriate remedial measures. The supervisory authority may impose disciplinary action under existing policies and/or contracts, as applicable (e.g., verbal warnings, written warnings, written reprimands, or termination of employment), or other action as deemed appropriate under the circumstances.\n\ni. If the HRO finds that a student has engaged in conduct that violates the [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy) (or other Middlebury policies under investigation, if applicable), the HRO will refer the matter to the supervisory authority for the program in which the student is enrolled at the time of the misconduct and the supervisory authority for any other Middlebury program in which the student is or will be enrolled (e.g., the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students,  Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Language Schools, Dean of International Programs, Dean of the Institute, Director of the Bread Loaf School of English, Director of the Bread Loaf Writer’s Conference, etc.), as applicable, for disciplinary action. Such disciplinary action could include warnings, written reprimands, probationary status, official college discipline, or suspension or expulsion from any or all Middlebury program(s) in which the student is or will be enrolled or participating, or other action as deemed appropriate under the circumstances (e.g. remedies applied to the respondent to address the needs of the complainant, including but not limited to room changes, class changes, building restrictions, extracurricular activity restrictions, modification of No Contact Orders to favor the complainant, and other actions to preserve the rights of the complainant to a discrimination-free environment). Additional non-disciplinary outcomes, such as extending and modifying mutual No Contact Orders, may also be imposed regardless of the finding.\n\nIf the conduct occurred during the course and scope of the student’s employment at Middlebury, the matter will be referred jointly to the Human Resources Department and the appropriate supervisory authority for the program(s) at issue, as applicable, for disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment and expulsion from Middlebury, or other action as deemed appropriate under the circumstances (see above).\n\nj. To the extent permitted by law, the complainant and respondent will be afforded the same rights and opportunities throughout the investigation and adjudication process, including the opportunity to present witnesses and other evidence. However, the decision to interview particular witnesses or consider evidence offered by the parties is within the sole discretion of the HRO and/or investigator.\n\nk. The complainant and respondent will ordinarily be notified of the HRO’s determination as to whether there was a policy violation. In sexual harassment cases involving student complainants, both parties will be notified of the HRO’s determination simultaneously in writing, to the extent permitted by law. However, information regarding discipline or sanctions will not be shared with any complainant under this policy except as permitted or required by law.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" id=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a>\n\n## 3.    Timely Investigation and Determination\n\nMiddlebury works to resolve all complaints handled under this Procedure in a timely manner. The investigation will be documented, and the HRO will track the investigation for reasonable and timely progress. Both the complainant and respondent will be informed when the investigation is complete, a determination has been issued, and, where appropriate, a sanction has been imposed.\n\nMiddlebury will not wait for the conclusion of a criminal investigation or proceeding to begin its own investigation and resolve complaints under this policy. Middlebury will, however, comply with valid requests by law enforcement for cooperation in a criminal investigation. As such, Middlebury may need to delay temporarily an investigation under this policy while law enforcement is in the process of gathering evidence. Once law enforcement has completed gathering evidence, Middlebury will promptly resume and complete its investigation. Middlebury may also take interim measures to ensure the safety and well-being of the complainant and the school community while law enforcement is gathering evidence.\n\n## 4.    Appeals \n\nIn cases where the respondent is a student, the complainant and respondent each has the right to appeal the outcome under the circumstances described below. The right of appeal is only available to a respondent or complainant who participated in the investigative process.\n\nThe purpose of an appeal is to review the adjudication process.\n\nAppeals are accepted on the basis of one or more of the following:\n\n- discovery of significant new factual material not available to the HRO that could have affected the original outcome; however, prior omission of factual information that the appealing party knew or reasonably should have known is not a ground for an appeal;\n- procedural error where the error prevented fundamental fairness;\n- The HRO, investigator(s), or another decision-maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally, or the individual complainant or respondent, that affected the outcome of the matter.\n\nAn appeal must be made in writing to the appellate officer for the program in connection with which the finding of responsibility was made. Therefore, an appeal must be directed to the VPAA (complaints against undergraduate students and complaints against MiddCore students), the Provost (complaints against Language Schools, Schools Abroad, Bread Loaf School of English, Bread Loaf Writers' Conference, and School of the Environment students) or the Middlebury Institute’s CAO (complaints against Institute students), as applicable.\n\nAppeals must be made within 5 days of receipt of notice of the HRO’s determination and must include the grounds for appeal and an outline of any supporting evidence.\n\nThe Middlebury official responsible for hearing the appeal (i.e., VPAA, Provost, or the Middlebury Institute’s CAO, as applicable) will invite an informational response to the appeal from the HRO and the other party (to the extent permitted by law), who may respond within 5 business days of the request. The Middlebury official may request assistance from the original investigator, or from a new investigator, or any other relevant individual, as necessary.\n\nThe Middlebury official may deny the appeal, or if one or more of the appeal grounds have been met, may:\n\n- return the case to the original HRO for reconsideration; or\n- appoint an alternate HRO  to review the case, which will ordinarily occur when the original outcome was deemed to be affected by an official's bias.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Middlebury official to determine which aspects of the case merit a new review, and to direct the HRO accordingly.\n\nAbsent extenuating circumstances, the Middlebury official will notify the complainant and respondent of the appeal decision simultaneously in writing within 15 days, to the extent permitted by law, and will notify the HRO in writing of instructions for any further action.\n\nAll decisions by the Middlebury official following a second review of the case are final.\n\n## 5.    Informal Resolutions/Disposition Prior to a Final Determination\n\nAt all stages of the investigation and determination processes, Middlebury officials, when appropriate, may make available to complainants informal resolution options for resolving complaints. In assessing whether alternative dispute resolution is appropriate, Middlebury officials may consider factors such as, for example, (1) the nature of the allegations, (2) the agreement of the complainant and the respondent, (3) other relevant factors such as any disability of the complainant or the respondent, or any history of misconduct or other policy violations by the respondent. A complainant will not be required to engage in alternative dispute resolution and may end the alternative dispute resolution process at any time. If the complainant ends the alternative resolution process or if the process is either not appropriate or is unsuccessful, Middlebury officials shall continue to respond to the allegations in accordance with this Procedure.\n\nIf at any point before or during the investigation, a student respondent chooses to accept responsibility under this policy, the HRO may issue a determination and refer the matter to the appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue in accordance with Section B.2.i., above. The supervisory authority may issue a sanction and/or take other action that is reasonably calculated to address the harassment or discriminatory conduct and prevent its recurrence.\n\n## 6.    Scope of Oversight (Students)\n\nStudents will be held accountable for the Scope of Oversight provision in section <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">II.</span>[B.2.a.iii.](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/a-introductory-matters) of the Handbook.\n\nMiddlebury retains sole discretion to determine whether to initiate an investigation and adjudication under this Procedure regardless of the outcome of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by a non-Middlebury institution or program and/or the outcome of any law enforcement investigation or court proceeding.\n\nIn cases where a student is found responsible for a policy violation while participating in any Middlebury program, the finding of responsibility may also be referred to the appropriate authority overseeing any additional Middlebury program or other school or program in which the student is or will also be enrolled for other action as deemed appropriate (see also Section B.2.i., above). This may include but is not limited to: further investigation; additional adjudication under existing policies (using only information gathered in the first disciplinary process, or using subsequently gathered information, or both, as deemed appropriate by the overseeing authority); disciplinary action; or other remedies or processes deemed appropriate by the authority overseeing the additional Middlebury and/or other program or school in which the student is or will be enrolled.\n\n## 7.    Emergency Removals\n\nMiddlebury’s Emergency Removals Policy is found at section [I.C.3](/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/emerg-removals) of the Handbook.\n\n## 8.    Plans or Directives Issued by the Human Relations Officer\n\nIn any case in which a finding of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation has been issued, violation of a plan or directive to address the harassment, discrimination, or retaliation may be grounds for further discipline.\n\n## 9.    Revisions & Complaints about the Civil Rights & TIX office\n\nThe [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy) and this Procedure may be amended from time to time; the policies and procedures published on Middlebury’s Website should be consulted for any updates. Amended policies and procedures, as published through Middlebury’s Website, shall supersede wholly any prior versions. Reasonable accommodations will be provided for persons with disabilities who need assistance in reviewing the [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy) and this Procedure and/or filing or pursuing a complaint under this Procedure, upon request.\n\nA student may file a complaint of discrimination, harassment, including sexual harassment, or related retaliation relating to the conduct of the HRO, Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator,  or investigator appointed under this policy with  Miguel Fernandez, Chief Diversity Officer (802.443.5792; [fernande@middlebury.edu](mailto:fernande@middlebury.edu)), or the appropriate supervisory authority for the Institute, as appropriate given the program at issue. Faculty and staff may file complaints relating to the conduct of the HRO, Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator, or investigator appointed under this policy with Miguel Fernandez, Chief Diversity Officer (802.443.5792; [fernande@middlebury.edu](mailto:fernande@middlebury.edu)). These officials may appoint an individual to serve as a special alternate HRO, as appropriate.\n\n## 10\\.    The Human Relations Officer and Record Keeping\n\nThe HRO may keep confidential records or reports developed under this Procedure and the actions taken in response to those reports, and use them for purposes such as to identify individuals or departments likely to benefit from training. Information about the HRO is available at several college offices: Human Relations Office, [Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator/Compliance Officer](https://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/hro), [Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/staff/node/508884), Commons deans, Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty, Public Safety, Human Resources, program directors, and the Middlebury Institute’s HROs.\n\n## 11\\.    Addendum (California Employees Only)\n\nCalifornia law has specific requirements for what must be set forth in a harassment/discrimination policy applicable to employees. In accordance with California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act Regulations (“FEHA”), and in addition to the policy provisions set forth above, this addendum applies to faculty, staff and other employees who are employed by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, Middlebury’s Language Schools at Mills College and any other Middlebury program that is located in California.\n\n**1\\. Definitions**\n\n_Employees_  \nWith respect to protections of individuals from unlawful harassment, the term “employee” shall include unpaid interns, volunteers, and persons providing services pursuant to a contract. With respect to protections of individuals from unlawful discrimination, the term “employee” shall include a person who serves in an unpaid internship or any other limited-duration program that provides work experience.\n\n_Discrimination_  \nDiscrimination is defined as conduct directed at an individual based on their perceived or actual race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex (includes pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, and related medical conditions), gender, gender identity, gender expression, age (over 40), sexual orientation, or military and veteran status of any person and/or any other status or characteristic as defined and to the extent protected by law.\n\nDiscrimination is established if a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that an enumerated basis (see above definition) was a substantial motivating factor in the denial of an employment benefit to that individual by the employer or other covered entity, and the denial is not justified by a permissible defense. This standard applies only to claims of discrimination on a basis above (see also Government Code Section 12940, subdivision (a)), and to claims of retaliation under Government Code section 12940 subdivision (h). A substantial factor motivating the denial of the employment benefit is a factor that a reasonable person would consider to have contributed to the denial. It must be more than a remote or trivial factor. It does not have to be the only cause of denial.\n\n_Harassment_  \nHarassment is defined as verbal, written, visual, or physical conduct based on or motivated by an individual's actual or perceived race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex (includes pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, and related medical conditions), gender, gender identity, gender expression, age (over 40), sexual orientation, or military and veteran status of any person and/or any other status or characteristic as defined and to the extent protected by law in the location where a particular program is operating, that has the purpose or effect, from the point of view of a reasonable person, of objectively and substantially:\n\n1.  undermining and detracting from or interfering with an individual's educational or work performance or access to Middlebury resources; or\n2.  creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive educational, work, or living environment.\n\nHarassment may include but is not limited to:\n\n1.  Verbal harassment, e.g., epithets, derogatory comments or slurs on a basis enumerated in the above;\n2.  Physical harassment, e.g., assault, impeding or blocking movement, or any physical interference with normal work or movement, when directed at an individual on a basis enumerated above;\n3.  Visual forms of harassment, e.g., derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings on a basis enumerated above; or\n4.  Sexual favors, e.g., unwanted sexual advances, which condition an employment benefit upon an exchange of sexual favors.\n\n_National Origin_  \n(a) National origin includes, but is not limited to, the individual’s or ancestors’ actual or perceived:\n\n(1)   Physical, cultural, or linguistic characteristics associated with a national origin group;\n\n(2)   marriage to or association with persons of a national origin group;\n\n(3)   tribal affiliation;\n\n(4)   membership in or association with an organization identified with or seeking to promote the interests of a national origin group;\n\n(5)   attendance or participation in schools, churches, temples, mosques, or other religious institutions generally used by persons of a national origin group; and\n\n(6)   name that is associated with a national origin group.\n\n(b) “National origin groups” include, but are not limited to, ethnic groups, geographic places of origin, and countries that are not presently in existence.\n\n(c) “Undocumented applicant or employee” means an applicant or employee who lacks legal authorization under federal law to be present and/or to work in the United States.\n\n_Retaliation_  \nRetaliation against any individual because the individual has opposed discrimination or harassment on the basis of any protected category, has participated in the filing of a complaint, or has testified, assisted, or participated in any other manner in a proceeding in which discrimination, harassment, or retaliation has been alleged is prohibited.\n\nRetaliation may include, but is not limited to:\n\n(1) threatening to contact or contacting immigration authorities or a law enforcement agency about the immigration status of the employee, former employee, applicant, or a family member (e.g., spouse, domestic partner, parent, sibling, child, uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, cousin, grandparent, great-grandparent, grandchild, or great-grandchild, by blood, adoption, marriage, or domestic partnership) of the employee, former employee, or applicant; or\n\n(2) taking adverse action against an employee because the employee updates or attempts to update personal information based on a change of name, social security number, or government-issued employment documents.\n\n_Prohibited Conduct (Coworkers, Third Parties, Supervisors and Managers)_  \nThe law prohibits coworkers and third parties, as well as supervisors and managers, with whom the employee comes in contact from engaging in unlawful harassment, discrimination, or retaliation.\n\n**2\\. Complaint Process**\n\nEmployees may complain orally or in writing. The complaint reporting process is described in more detail in Section B above. In addition to those procedures, the parties involved in a harassment, discrimination or related retaliation complaint will receive a designation of confidentiality, to the extent possible. Confidentiality will be kept by Middlebury to the extent possible, although Middlebury cannot promise absolute confidentiality.\n\nWhen Middlebury receives allegations of misconduct under this policy, it will conduct a fair, timely, and thorough investigation and reach reasonable conclusions based on the evidence presented.\n\nSupervisors must report any complaints of misconduct under this policy to a Human Relations Officer so that Middlebury can try to resolve the claim internally. (This provision does not preclude employees from filing complaints with external agencies. See the Civil Rights and Title IX website for more information.).\n\nIf at the end of the investigation misconduct under this policy is found, appropriate remedial measures shall be taken.\n\nThe investigation will be documented, and the Human Relations Officer will track the investigation for reasonable progress.\n\n**3\\. Dissemination of the Policy**\n\nThis addendum, along with the full text of Middlebury’s [Non-Discrimination](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Investigations & Resolutions Procedure</span>, will be disseminated to all California employees via email with an acknowledgement return form.\n\n---\n\n## C. Policy on Consensual Relationships Between Faculty and Staff Members and Students\n\nThe integrity and trust of the faculty-student relationship is central to Middlebury’s educational mission.  Amorous relationships, defined as any dating, sexual, or other romantic relationship of any length between a faculty member and a student, even if they are not directly in any advisory or teaching role, involve a power differential, and therefore raise serious questions about unfair grading or other imbalanced evaluation practices, conflicts of interest, favoritism and bias. These concerns have an adverse impact on the educational environment of other students, as well as the student directly involved.\n\nA seemingly consensual relationship between any employee with a student may meet the legal definition of sexual harassment, as lack of mutual consent may be inferred from the power differential between the employee – whether faculty or staff – and a student. Accordingly, amorous relationships between all Middlebury employees – faculty and staff – and all students enrolled in any Middlebury program are prohibited.\n\nIn exceptional cases falling outside of the anticipated scope of this policy, such as a relationship between an employee and a graduate student in an unrelated Middlebury program, exemptions to this policy may be granted by the Vice President for Academic Affairs/Dean of Faculty (“VPAA/DoF”), or their designee(s), for faculty members, and the Vice President of Human Resources (“VPHR”), or their designee(s), for staff members.  Any employee, whether faculty or staff, who wishes to request such an exemption, shall submit a written statement to the VPAA/DoF or the VPHR, as applicable, explaining the reasons for the request. The VPAA/DoF or the VPHR will consult with the student and then respond in writing to the faculty or staff member with their decision and any conditions of approval that may apply, as applicable.\n\nQuestions about this policy shall be directed to the VPAA/DoF for faculty, or the VPHR for staff.\n\nIf Middlebury receives information that a faculty or staff member has violated this policy, the procedures laid out in the applicable misconduct policy shall be followed. If the employee is found to have violated this policy, the faculty or staff member will be subject to all appropriate discipline, including termination, consistent with the procedures of the applicable policy.\n\n---\n\n## D. Intellectual Inquiry and Debate\n\nMiddlebury is a community of learners and as such recognizes and affirms that free intellectual inquiry, debate, and constructive dialogue are vital to Middlebury’s academic mission and must be protected even when the views expressed are unpopular or controversial. Middlebury’s [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy) and this Procedure are meant neither to proscribe nor to inhibit discussions, in or out of the classroom, of complex, controversial, or sensitive matters, including sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, race, color, ethnicity, religion, marital status, place of birth, ancestry, national origin, age, or disability, when in the judgment of a reasonable person they arise appropriately and with respect for the dignity of others. Middlebury also recognizes that verbal conduct can be used specifically to intimidate or coerce and to inhibit genuine discourse, free inquiry, and learning. Such abuses are unacceptable. The \"reasonable person standard\" is to be used in judging whether harassment has occurred.\n\n---\n\n## GLOSSARY\n\n**Human Relations Officer**\n\nThe Human Relations Officer (“HRO”) is the administrator responsible for overseeing investigations and adjudicating complaints under this policy.\n\n**Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator**  \nThe Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator is the administrator responsible for receiving initial complaints and concerns about any form of discrimination and/or harassment, as well as coordinating training, outreach, etc.\n\n**Complainant**\n\nA complainant is usually an individual who has alleged a violation(s) of Middlebury’s [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy) that can be investigated and adjudicated under this Procedure. In some cases (such as, e.g., cases in which a person involved in an incident of an alleged policy violation does not wish to participate in the process but Middlebury decides that the alleged misconduct needs to be addressed), Middlebury may serve as the complainant or may pursue an investigation and adjudication under this Procedure without a designated complainant. In these cases, Middlebury may extend the full rights of the complainant as defined in this Procedure to affected parties as deemed appropriate by the HRO.\n\n**Respondent**\n\nA respondent is an individual whose alleged conduct is being investigated to determine if it is in violation of the [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy) or other Middlebury policies, if applicable. See also B.6.Scope of Oversight of this policy for more information.\n\n**Confidential Resources**  \nConfidential resources include the staff of the Parton Center for Health and Wellness, the staff of the Chaplain’s office, Middlebury Safe and Confidential Advocates (“MiddSafe” <a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" id=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a>) or other medical, counseling, support or religious personnel and volunteers who are required by law to maintain confidentiality. For more information, see Section A.5\\. Confidentiality.\n\n**No Contact Order**\n\nWhen harassment or other forms of interpersonal misconduct have been alleged, or when otherwise deemed appropriate under the circumstances, the vice president for student affairs and dean of students, vice president for academic affairs and dean of language schools, dean of international programs, RDs, Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator, HRO, Public Safety staff, or appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue may issue No Contact Orders to the persons involved, whether or not disciplinary action is taken. A No Contact Order is used to restrict encounters between individuals. While a No Contact Order in and of itself does not constitute discipline and will not appear in an employee’s personnel file or on a student’s disciplinary record, refusal to adhere to the order after written or verbal notification of its terms is prohibited and may result in disciplinary action.\n\n**No Trespass Notice**\n\nA No Trespass Notice prohibits the presence of an individual on Middlebury property, or other properties on which Middlebury programs are occurring. No Trespass Notices are legally enforceable and may lead to the arrest of individuals in violation.\n\n**Days**\n\nUnless otherwise noted, “days” indicates calendar days, regardless of whether the majority of Middlebury’s administrative offices are open. “Business days” indicates days on which the majority of Middlebury’s administrative offices are open, and generally connotes Mondays through Fridays.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator\n\nInquiries concerning the application of Title IX may be referred to Middlebury’s [Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator](https://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/hro) or to the United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights.

Reasonable accommodations will be provided for persons with disabilities who need assistance in reviewing Middlebury’s [Nondiscrimination Statement](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/general/nondiscrimination) and its Non-Discrimination policies and procedures.\n\nThe [Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator](https://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/hro) is the administrator responsible for coordinating Middlebury’s efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Title IX. The Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator’s responsibilities include overseeing the process for handling all Title IX complaints and identifying and addressing any patterns or systemic problems that arise during the review of such complaints.\n\nMiddlebury’s Human Relations Officers serve as the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator’s designees for the purposes of overseeing investigations and adjudicating sexual harassment and related retaliation complaints under this policy and sexual misconduct and related retaliation complaints under Middlebury’s [Non-Discrimination Policy.](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy) Middlebury’s Alternate Human Relations Officers serve in a similar capacity as the Title IX Coordinator’s designee(s) when the Human Relations Officers are unavailable or have a conflict of interest.\n\n**Civil Rights & Title IX Coordinator**\n\nMarti J.

The policy also applies to volunteers, interns and persons providing services pursuant to a contract to the extent required by applicable local law.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin#Addendum\">Addendum</a> applicable to California employees only, in this document below.</p>\n<p>This Procedure is available online at go/antiharassment. Printed copies may be requested from the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator.</p>\n<p>There are many resources available to individuals who are involved in some way with an incident of discrimination, retaliation, or harassment, including sexual harassment. Please see Appendix <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin#A\">A</a> for contact information.</p>\n<h2>2.    Proceedings Outside of Middlebury</h2>\n<p>Any individual has the right to pursue discrimination and harassment complaints, including sexual harassment and related retaliation utilizing local, state, or federal enforcement agencies, including local and state police agencies, as appropriate, regardless of whether they choose to file a complaint with Middlebury (see contact information available on the Civil Rights and Title IX website). The agencies listed on the Civil Rights and Title IX website can conduct impartial investigations, and facilitate conciliation, and, if an agency finds that there is probable cause or reasonable grounds to believe that unlawful harassment, discrimination, or retaliation has occurred, it may take the case to court.</p>\n<p>a. Criminal Complaints</p>\n<p>Any student or employee may pursue criminal charges with local, state, or federal law enforcement agencies. Middlebury will offer and, upon request, provide assistance to individuals covered under this procedure with notifying law enforcement agencies. These options are available regardless of whether an individual chooses to file a complaint with Middlebury. Individuals have the option to notify such agencies with or without assistance from Middlebury, and have the option not to personally notify such authorities.</p>\n<p>b. Orders of Protection</p>\n<p>Middlebury does not have the authority to issue Relief From Abuse Orders, Orders of Protection or Restraining Orders as these are granted by the court system. Individuals who have experienced Title IX Sexual Harassment may be eligible to pursue Orders of Protection, Restraining Orders and/or Relief from Abuse Orders from courts in the United States or courts outside of the United States as applicable. Middlebury will offer its support to individuals if they request Middlebury’s assistance with making contact with law enforcement authorities and other external resources to seek such orders. Middlebury will respect such orders to the extent applicable.</p>\n<p>c. Assistance by Middlebury</p>\n<p>Requests for assistance with contacting law enforcement authorities or obtaining an Order of Protection, a Relief from Abuse Order, a Restraining Order or other lawful order may be made in person, via email, phone or teleconference to the CRTIX Coordinator, an HRO, or Public Safety For additional information regarding making reports to the police and/or obtaining an Order of Protection, Restraining Order, or Relief from Abuse Order.</p>\n<h2>3.    What This Procedure Covers </h2>\n<p>This Non-Discrimination Investigations &#x26; Resolutions Procedure is intended to address instances of prohibited discrimination, including sexual harassment and other harassment, as defined in Middlebury’s Non-Discrimination Policy that are not required by the Department of Education to be handled under Middlebury’s Title IX Investigation &#x26; Resolutions Procedure.</p>\n<p>Middlebury may, in exceptional circumstances, vary from this Procedure. So long as such a variation is consistent with relevant law and allows for fundamental fairness in the processes followed, variations from this process under those circumstances will not invalidate an outcome.</p>\n<p>Middlebury complies with all applicable provisions of state and federal law which prohibit discrimination in employment, or in admission or access to its educational or extracurricular programs, activities, or facilities. With respect to Middlebury programs operating in states other than Vermont (e.g., California, New Mexico, and Washington D.C.), discrimination shall be defined as stated in the Non-Discrimination Policy unless the local law applicable to the program at issue mandates a broader definition, in which case such law will apply.</p>\n<h2>4.    Retaliation</h2>\n<p>Retaliation against an individual for raising an allegation of discrimination, for cooperating in an investigation of such a complaint, or for opposing discriminatory practices is prohibited under the Non-Discrimination Policy.</p>\n<h2>5.    Confidentiality</h2>\n<p>Certain Middlebury employees may maintain confidentiality, but most cannot. Although strict confidentiality may therefore not be guaranteed, in all cases Middlebury will handle information in a sensitive manner and will endeavor to protect the privacy of individuals and maintain confidentiality to the extent possible consistent with its obligations to respond to reports of discrimination, harassment and/or related retaliation.</p>\n<p>This section is intended to inform students, faculty, and staff of the various reporting and confidential disclosure options available to them, so that they can make informed choices about where to go for help.</p>\n<p>a. Confidential Resources</p>\n<p>A confidential resource is an individual who is legally and ethically bound to keep confidential all information shared with them in the course of providing counsel and support, except under the circumstances noted below. Middlebury respects that the decision to come forward may be difficult and that individuals may wish to seek assistance from someone who can provide confidential information and support, and who can provide assurances that what is disclosed will not be acted on except in the circumstances outlined below. (For a list of confidential resources, see the Civil Rights and Title IX website).</p>\n<p>In general, the law recognizes and protects the confidentiality of communications between a person seeking care and a medical or mental health professional, religious advisor or MiddSafe Advocate. The medical, mental health, religious professionals and MiddSafe advocates at Middlebury and their off-campus counterparts respect and protect confidential communications from students, faculty, and staff to the extent they are legally able to do so. These professionals may have to breach a confidence, however, when they perceive a serious risk of danger or threat to any person or property. In addition, medical and mental health professionals may be required by law to report certain crimes (e.g., any allegation of sexual and/or physical abuse of a person under 18). These exceptions to confidentiality are governed by the law of the state in which the confidential resource is located.</p>\n<p>An individual who speaks to a confidential resource must understand that, if they want to maintain confidentiality, Middlebury will be unable to conduct an investigation into the particular incident or pursue disciplinary action against the individual who is alleged to have violated this policy.</p>\n<p>b.Non-Confidential Resources</p>\n<p>Non-confidential resources are all faculty or staff members, including ombudpersons and residential life staff who are not medical or counseling professionals, clergy, or MiddSafe Advocates, and are therefore not permitted to honor requests for confidentiality. Non-confidential faculty or staff who learn of an incident of discrimination, harassment or related retaliation involving a student are required to report that information to the HRO. (See Section B.1. for more information).</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff who are “<a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/csa\">Campus Security Authorities</a>” are required to report certain crimes to the Department of Public Safety for the purpose of compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act.</p>\n<p>Employees with supervisory responsibility are expected to report all incidents of harassment, discrimination and related retaliation involving employees to the HRO and/or to Human Resources.</p>\n<p>General inquiries to Middlebury officials about policies or procedures, and conversations in which the alleged wrongdoer is not identified by name or by implication from the circumstances may remain private. Otherwise, individuals who want to maintain confidentiality should seek a confidential resource.</p>\n<p>c. Confidentiality</p>\n<p>Middlebury is responsible for providing a safe and nondiscriminatory environment for students, faculty and staff.  Outside of the Confidential Resources outlined above, Middlebury will take reasonable steps to avoid disclosure of the identity of a complainant.  Depending on a number of factors including the specifics of a concern, the identity of a complainant may become readily apparent.  Middlebury will only disclose information regarding a concern of discrimination on a need to know basis or as required to by law.</p>\n<p>d. Other Disclosures Required by Law</p>\n<p>Middlebury will not include the names of complainants or other identifying information in publicly available reports as required by the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. In certain circumstances, Middlebury may need to report an incident to law enforcement authorities. Such circumstances include but are not limited to incidents that warrant the undertaking of safety and security measures for the protection of the individual and/or the campus community, instances involving abuse of minors, or situations in which there is clear and imminent danger and/or a weapon may be involved.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>B. Procedures for Addressing Harassment, Discrimination and Related Retaliation</h2>\n<p>Middlebury encourages individuals to report incidents of discrimination, harassment and related retaliation so that they can obtain support and information and so that Middlebury can respond appropriately.  Individuals are encouraged to report their concerns to the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator.</p>\n<h2>1.    Reporting Requirements for Staff and Faculty</h2>\n<p>All members of Middlebury’s community are expected to promote an environment free from prohibited discrimination, harassment, including sexual harassment, and related retaliation.</p>\n<p>Any faculty or staff member who learns of an incident of discrimination, harassment, or related retaliation involving a student must report this information to a Middlebury Human Relations Officer or the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator (see <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin#A\">Appendix A</a> for contact information), or the appropriate dean or program director in cases involving the Language Schools, Schools Abroad, Bread Loaf, the Middlebury Institute, MiddCore, School of the Environment, or other Middlebury program, as applicable, unless their status as a confidential resource precludes this disclosure. Confidential resources include the staff of the Center for Health and Wellness, the staff of the Chaplain’s Office, MiddSafe Advocates, or other medical, counseling, support or religious personnel and volunteers who are required by law to maintain confidentiality. Please see Section A.5. Confidentiality for more information.</p>\n<p>Employees with supervisory responsibility must report incidents of discrimination, harassment, including sexual harassment, or retaliation, and, if directed by HR or another appropriate official, take appropriate remedial action should such matters come to their attention. Supervisors should report any complaints or suspected acts of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation (even if they do not involve direct reports) to a HRO, Human Resources, or the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator in accordance with Section 2, below. Depending upon the circumstances of a given situation, supervisors may be responsible for taking steps such as, by way of example but not limitation, addressing issues directly with staff, faculty, or students whom they supervise, facilitating informal resolution or mediation of issues, providing information on avenues to address questions of harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation, or pursuing complaints under the complaint procedures described here.</p>\n<p>Failure to report or address harassment, discrimination, or retaliation complaints or suspected acts of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation appropriately in accordance with this section may be considered a violation of Middlebury’s policy.</p>\n<h2>2.    Complaint Procedures</h2>\n<p>Any Middlebury student, faculty member, staff member or applicant (for employment or to any Middlebury program) who has reasonable cause to believe that discrimination or harassment, including sexual harassment, has occurred or is occurring, or who believes that a student, faculty member, staff member or applicant has been subjected to retaliation for having brought or supported a complaint of discrimination or harassment, is encouraged to bring that information to the immediate attention of the official who is designated to receive such reports in the Middlebury program at issue (reports or complaints can be made verbally or in writing).<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" id=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Reports may also be made to the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator or any HRO (student, faculty and staff matters), or to Human Resources (employees).</p>\n<p>If the designated HRO is unavailable, or if the HRO has a conflict of interest, the report should be made to the designated alternate HRO for the program at issue. The alternate shall have the same authority as the designated HRO to oversee investigations and adjudicate harassment, discrimination, and retaliation complaints. The names and contact information for offices and/or individuals serving as Human Relations Officers and alternate Human Relations Officers in Middlebury’s various programs and locations are listed on the Civil Rights and Title IX website.</p>\n<p>Middlebury encourages students, faculty, staff and applicants to report instances of unwelcome protected-characteristic-related conduct (including unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature) even if the conduct is not sufficiently severe such that it undermines and detracts from or interferes with an individual’s education, work performance, or access to Middlebury resources, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive educational, work, or living environment. Middlebury encourages such reports, including through our online form, so that the behavior can be addressed before it creates a hostile environment for the affected individual. In such instances, the HRO and/or other Middlebury officials, to the extent appropriate, will address the conduct in a manner that is reasonably calculated to prevent its reoccurrence.</p>\n<p>When the HRO receives actual notice – i.e., a written or oral complaint or report directed to the HRO – of conduct that may constitute prohibited discrimination or harassment (including sexual harassment) or related retaliation that may be investigated and adjudicated under this Procedure, Middlebury will initiate the following process, except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, below:</p>\n<p>a. The HRO will promptly determine initially whether the report or complaint alleges conduct that is prohibited by the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy\">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> and whether an investigation and adjudication should proceed under this Procedure.</p>\n<p>b. If the HRO determines that the report or complaint does fall within the scope of  the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy\">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> and that an investigation and adjudication should proceed, a copy of the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy\">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> and this Procedure will be provided to the complainant and the respondent and the parties will be notified that Middlebury is investigating the possibility that the respondent has violated the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy\">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> using this Procedure (absent extenuating circumstances). The HRO will then, individually or in conjunction with other Middlebury offices or individuals (including, if warranted, independent investigators), promptly and equitably conduct or supervise an investigation that is appropriate under the circumstances. The investigation will be conducted in a prompt, thorough, fair, timely, equitable, and impartial manner.</p>\n<p>The investigator is authorized to contact any and all individuals; Middlebury recognizes, however, that individuals who are bound by legal privileges may not be able to disclose privileged information, unless an exception applies. The investigator is authorized to access relevant records, except those legally protected as confidential or privileged, and may collect any additional evidence relevant to the complaint. The nature and scope of the investigation is within the sole discretion of the investigator and/or the HRO.</p>\n<p>All witnesses identified in connection with an investigation under this Procedure are expected to cooperate fully in the investigation by providing complete, accurate, and truthful information. Middlebury policy prohibits intentionally making a false report or providing false or misleading information in any investigation under this Procedure. Complainants will not be deemed to have provided false or misleading information under this policy if their factual allegations are intended to be truthful and are made in good faith, regardless of whether the conduct complained of is ultimately found to constitute a policy violation.</p>\n<p>Witnesses may be expected to sign statements or other documents memorializing the information provided in the course of the investigation and may be asked to keep the substance of the investigation interview confidential. Failure to cooperate fully with the investigator or other Middlebury official (including but not limited to providing false information, as described above) may subject the employee or student to the full range of disciplinary actions available to the supervising authority or responsible official in accordance with the program’s existing policies and/or contracts, as applicable, up to and including termination of employment or suspension or expulsion from Middlebury.</p>\n<p>The parties may retain legal counsel at any time, although legal counsel is not permitted to participate in Middlebury’s investigation and adjudication process under this Procedure. Attorneys who wish to communicate about a case may contact Middlebury’s legal counsel directly.</p>\n<p>In cases where the student is a respondent, if at any point prior to or during the investigation and adjudication process, the HRO becomes aware that other Middlebury policies may have been violated in relation to the matter under investigation, these alleged policy violations may, where appropriate, also be resolved through the investigation and adjudication process in this Procedure. The decision to investigate and adjudicate other alleged policy violations is within the sole discretion of the HRO. In all cases the parties will be notified if the HRO determines that additional alleged policy violations will be investigated and adjudicated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.</p>\n<p>c. The HROs, Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator, Vice President for Academic Affairs/Dean of Faculty (“VPAA”), Human Resources Department, Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students, Vice president for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Language Schools, Dean of International Programs, RDs, public safety staff, or other supervisory authority for the program at issue (or their designees) may also at any time take appropriate steps, including by way of example only, issuance of No Contact Orders, temporary changes in assignment of duties or housing, changes in class schedules or class requirements, or other accommodations, as appropriate, to protect complaining parties on an interim basis.</p>\n<p>d. After the investigation is completed, the investigator shall issue a report to the adjudicating HRO, together with recommended findings, based on a preponderance of the evidence standard, i.e., whether it was more likely than not that the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy\">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> (or other Middlebury policies, if applicable) was violated. The report may be issued orally or in writing depending on the nature and complexity of the information.</p>\n<p>e. The adjudicating HRO is not bound by the investigator’s report. Rather, it is advisory to the HRO. The adjudicating HRO may accept or reject the investigator’s recommended finding in whole or in part, and may request additional relevant information before making a determination. The HRO should avoid duplicating the efforts of the investigator, as well as accepting the investigator’s recommended finding without careful review of all of the evidence.</p>\n<p>f. Either party may choose to meet individually with the adjudicating HRO prior to the HRO’s determination. The HRO may also request an individual meeting with either party or any other person(s) as appropriate.</p>\n<p>g. After review of the investigator’s report and recommended finding, the HRO shall issue a determination as to whether a violation of the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy\">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> occurred. The HRO’s determination will be based on a preponderance of the evidence standard, and the HRO will reach a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence presented.</p>\n<p>h. If the HRO finds that a staff or faculty member has engaged in conduct that violates the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy\">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> the HRO will refer the matter to the appropriate supervisory authority  (e.g., the Middlebury College VPAA or designee, Provost, the Middlebury Institute’s Chief Academic Officer or designee [“the Middlebury Institute’s CAO”], Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Language Schools, Dean of International Programs, in the case of a faculty member, as applicable to the program at issue, and/or the Middlebury College Human Resources Department, or the Middlebury Institute’s Human Resources Department, as applicable, in the case of a staff member) to take appropriate remedial measures. The supervisory authority may impose disciplinary action under existing policies and/or contracts, as applicable (e.g., verbal warnings, written warnings, written reprimands, or termination of employment), or other action as deemed appropriate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p>i. If the HRO finds that a student has engaged in conduct that violates the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy\">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> (or other Middlebury policies under investigation, if applicable), the HRO will refer the matter to the supervisory authority for the program in which the student is enrolled at the time of the misconduct and the supervisory authority for any other Middlebury program in which the student is or will be enrolled (e.g., the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students,  Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Language Schools, Dean of International Programs, Dean of the Institute, Director of the Bread Loaf School of English, Director of the Bread Loaf Writer’s Conference, etc.), as applicable, for disciplinary action. Such disciplinary action could include warnings, written reprimands, probationary status, official college discipline, or suspension or expulsion from any or all Middlebury program(s) in which the student is or will be enrolled or participating, or other action as deemed appropriate under the circumstances (e.g. remedies applied to the respondent to address the needs of the complainant, including but not limited to room changes, class changes, building restrictions, extracurricular activity restrictions, modification of No Contact Orders to favor the complainant, and other actions to preserve the rights of the complainant to a discrimination-free environment). Additional non-disciplinary outcomes, such as extending and modifying mutual No Contact Orders, may also be imposed regardless of the finding.</p>\n<p>If the conduct occurred during the course and scope of the student’s employment at Middlebury, the matter will be referred jointly to the Human Resources Department and the appropriate supervisory authority for the program(s) at issue, as applicable, for disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment and expulsion from Middlebury, or other action as deemed appropriate under the circumstances (see above).</p>\n<p>j. To the extent permitted by law, the complainant and respondent will be afforded the same rights and opportunities throughout the investigation and adjudication process, including the opportunity to present witnesses and other evidence. However, the decision to interview particular witnesses or consider evidence offered by the parties is within the sole discretion of the HRO and/or investigator.</p>\n<p>k. The complainant and respondent will ordinarily be notified of the HRO’s determination as to whether there was a policy violation. In sexual harassment cases involving student complainants, both parties will be notified of the HRO’s determination simultaneously in writing, to the extent permitted by law. However, information regarding discipline or sanctions will not be shared with any complainant under this policy except as permitted or required by law.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" id=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a></p>\n<h2>3.    Timely Investigation and Determination</h2>\n<p>Middlebury works to resolve all complaints handled under this Procedure in a timely manner. The investigation will be documented, and the HRO will track the investigation for reasonable and timely progress. Both the complainant and respondent will be informed when the investigation is complete, a determination has been issued, and, where appropriate, a sanction has been imposed.</p>\n<p>Middlebury will not wait for the conclusion of a criminal investigation or proceeding to begin its own investigation and resolve complaints under this policy. Middlebury will, however, comply with valid requests by law enforcement for cooperation in a criminal investigation. As such, Middlebury may need to delay temporarily an investigation under this policy while law enforcement is in the process of gathering evidence. Once law enforcement has completed gathering evidence, Middlebury will promptly resume and complete its investigation. Middlebury may also take interim measures to ensure the safety and well-being of the complainant and the school community while law enforcement is gathering evidence.</p>\n<h2>4.    Appeals </h2>\n<p>In cases where the respondent is a student, the complainant and respondent each has the right to appeal the outcome under the circumstances described below. The right of appeal is only available to a respondent or complainant who participated in the investigative process.</p>\n<p>The purpose of an appeal is to review the adjudication process.</p>\n<p>Appeals are accepted on the basis of one or more of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>discovery of significant new factual material not available to the HRO that could have affected the original outcome; however, prior omission of factual information that the appealing party knew or reasonably should have known is not a ground for an appeal;</li>\n<li>procedural error where the error prevented fundamental fairness;</li>\n<li>The HRO, investigator(s), or another decision-maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally, or the individual complainant or respondent, that affected the outcome of the matter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An appeal must be made in writing to the appellate officer for the program in connection with which the finding of responsibility was made. Therefore, an appeal must be directed to the VPAA (complaints against undergraduate students and complaints against MiddCore students), the Provost (complaints against Language Schools, Schools Abroad, Bread Loaf School of English, Bread Loaf Writers' Conference, and School of the Environment students) or the Middlebury Institute’s CAO (complaints against Institute students), as applicable.</p>\n<p>Appeals must be made within 5 days of receipt of notice of the HRO’s determination and must include the grounds for appeal and an outline of any supporting evidence.</p>\n<p>The Middlebury official responsible for hearing the appeal (i.e., VPAA, Provost, or the Middlebury Institute’s CAO, as applicable) will invite an informational response to the appeal from the HRO and the other party (to the extent permitted by law), who may respond within 5 business days of the request. The Middlebury official may request assistance from the original investigator, or from a new investigator, or any other relevant individual, as necessary.</p>\n<p>The Middlebury official may deny the appeal, or if one or more of the appeal grounds have been met, may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>return the case to the original HRO for reconsideration; or</li>\n<li>appoint an alternate HRO  to review the case, which will ordinarily occur when the original outcome was deemed to be affected by an official's bias.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is the responsibility of the Middlebury official to determine which aspects of the case merit a new review, and to direct the HRO accordingly.</p>\n<p>Absent extenuating circumstances, the Middlebury official will notify the complainant and respondent of the appeal decision simultaneously in writing within 15 days, to the extent permitted by law, and will notify the HRO in writing of instructions for any further action.</p>\n<p>All decisions by the Middlebury official following a second review of the case are final.</p>\n<h2>5.    Informal Resolutions/Disposition Prior to a Final Determination</h2>\n<p>At all stages of the investigation and determination processes, Middlebury officials, when appropriate, may make available to complainants informal resolution options for resolving complaints. In assessing whether alternative dispute resolution is appropriate, Middlebury officials may consider factors such as, for example, (1) the nature of the allegations, (2) the agreement of the complainant and the respondent, (3) other relevant factors such as any disability of the complainant or the respondent, or any history of misconduct or other policy violations by the respondent. A complainant will not be required to engage in alternative dispute resolution and may end the alternative dispute resolution process at any time. If the complainant ends the alternative resolution process or if the process is either not appropriate or is unsuccessful, Middlebury officials shall continue to respond to the allegations in accordance with this Procedure.</p>\n<p>If at any point before or during the investigation, a student respondent chooses to accept responsibility under this policy, the HRO may issue a determination and refer the matter to the appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue in accordance with Section B.2.i., above. The supervisory authority may issue a sanction and/or take other action that is reasonably calculated to address the harassment or discriminatory conduct and prevent its recurrence.</p>\n<h2>6.    Scope of Oversight (Students)</h2>\n<p>Students will be held accountable for the Scope of Oversight provision in section <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">II.</span><a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/a-introductory-matters\">B.2.a.iii.</a> of the Handbook.</p>\n<p>Middlebury retains sole discretion to determine whether to initiate an investigation and adjudication under this Procedure regardless of the outcome of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by a non-Middlebury institution or program and/or the outcome of any law enforcement investigation or court proceeding.</p>\n<p>In cases where a student is found responsible for a policy violation while participating in any Middlebury program, the finding of responsibility may also be referred to the appropriate authority overseeing any additional Middlebury program or other school or program in which the student is or will also be enrolled for other action as deemed appropriate (see also Section B.2.i., above). This may include but is not limited to: further investigation; additional adjudication under existing policies (using only information gathered in the first disciplinary process, or using subsequently gathered information, or both, as deemed appropriate by the overseeing authority); disciplinary action; or other remedies or processes deemed appropriate by the authority overseeing the additional Middlebury and/or other program or school in which the student is or will be enrolled.</p>\n<h2>7.    Emergency Removals</h2>\n<p>Middlebury’s Emergency Removals Policy is found at section <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/emerg-removals\">I.C.3</a> of the Handbook.</p>\n<h2>8.    Plans or Directives Issued by the Human Relations Officer</h2>\n<p>In any case in which a finding of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation has been issued, violation of a plan or directive to address the harassment, discrimination, or retaliation may be grounds for further discipline.</p>\n<h2>9.    Revisions &#x26; Complaints about the Civil Rights &#x26; TIX office</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy\">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> and this Procedure may be amended from time to time; the policies and procedures published on Middlebury’s Website should be consulted for any updates. Amended policies and procedures, as published through Middlebury’s Website, shall supersede wholly any prior versions. Reasonable accommodations will be provided for persons with disabilities who need assistance in reviewing the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy\">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> and this Procedure and/or filing or pursuing a complaint under this Procedure, upon request.</p>\n<p>A student may file a complaint of discrimination, harassment, including sexual harassment, or related retaliation relating to the conduct of the HRO, Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator,  or investigator appointed under this policy with  Miguel Fernandez, Chief Diversity Officer (802.443.5792; <a href=\"mailto:fernande@middlebury.edu\">fernande@middlebury.edu</a>), or the appropriate supervisory authority for the Institute, as appropriate given the program at issue. Faculty and staff may file complaints relating to the conduct of the HRO, Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator, or investigator appointed under this policy with Miguel Fernandez, Chief Diversity Officer (802.443.5792; <a href=\"mailto:fernande@middlebury.edu\">fernande@middlebury.edu</a>). These officials may appoint an individual to serve as a special alternate HRO, as appropriate.</p>\n<h2>10.    The Human Relations Officer and Record Keeping</h2>\n<p>The HRO may keep confidential records or reports developed under this Procedure and the actions taken in response to those reports, and use them for purposes such as to identify individuals or departments likely to benefit from training. Information about the HRO is available at several college offices: Human Relations Office, <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/hro\">Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator/Compliance Officer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/staff/node/508884\">Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students</a>, Commons deans, Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty, Public Safety, Human Resources, program directors, and the Middlebury Institute’s HROs.</p>\n<h2>11.    Addendum (California Employees Only)</h2>\n<p>California law has specific requirements for what must be set forth in a harassment/discrimination policy applicable to employees. In accordance with California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act Regulations (“FEHA”), and in addition to the policy provisions set forth above, this addendum applies to faculty, staff and other employees who are employed by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, Middlebury’s Language Schools at Mills College and any other Middlebury program that is located in California.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Definitions</strong></p>\n<p><em>Employees</em><br>\nWith respect to protections of individuals from unlawful harassment, the term “employee” shall include unpaid interns, volunteers, and persons providing services pursuant to a contract. With respect to protections of individuals from unlawful discrimination, the term “employee” shall include a person who serves in an unpaid internship or any other limited-duration program that provides work experience.</p>\n<p><em>Discrimination</em><br>\nDiscrimination is defined as conduct directed at an individual based on their perceived or actual race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex (includes pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, and related medical conditions), gender, gender identity, gender expression, age (over 40), sexual orientation, or military and veteran status of any person and/or any other status or characteristic as defined and to the extent protected by law.</p>\n<p>Discrimination is established if a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that an enumerated basis (see above definition) was a substantial motivating factor in the denial of an employment benefit to that individual by the employer or other covered entity, and the denial is not justified by a permissible defense. This standard applies only to claims of discrimination on a basis above (see also Government Code Section 12940, subdivision (a)), and to claims of retaliation under Government Code section 12940 subdivision (h). A substantial factor motivating the denial of the employment benefit is a factor that a reasonable person would consider to have contributed to the denial. It must be more than a remote or trivial factor. It does not have to be the only cause of denial.</p>\n<p><em>Harassment</em><br>\nHarassment is defined as verbal, written, visual, or physical conduct based on or motivated by an individual's actual or perceived race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex (includes pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, and related medical conditions), gender, gender identity, gender expression, age (over 40), sexual orientation, or military and veteran status of any person and/or any other status or characteristic as defined and to the extent protected by law in the location where a particular program is operating, that has the purpose or effect, from the point of view of a reasonable person, of objectively and substantially:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>undermining and detracting from or interfering with an individual's educational or work performance or access to Middlebury resources; or</li>\n<li>creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive educational, work, or living environment.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Harassment may include but is not limited to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Verbal harassment, e.g., epithets, derogatory comments or slurs on a basis enumerated in the above;</li>\n<li>Physical harassment, e.g., assault, impeding or blocking movement, or any physical interference with normal work or movement, when directed at an individual on a basis enumerated above;</li>\n<li>Visual forms of harassment, e.g., derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings on a basis enumerated above; or</li>\n<li>Sexual favors, e.g., unwanted sexual advances, which condition an employment benefit upon an exchange of sexual favors.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>National Origin</em><br>\n(a) National origin includes, but is not limited to, the individual’s or ancestors’ actual or perceived:</p>\n<p>(1)   Physical, cultural, or linguistic characteristics associated with a national origin group;</p>\n<p>(2)   marriage to or association with persons of a national origin group;</p>\n<p>(3)   tribal affiliation;</p>\n<p>(4)   membership in or association with an organization identified with or seeking to promote the interests of a national origin group;</p>\n<p>(5)   attendance or participation in schools, churches, temples, mosques, or other religious institutions generally used by persons of a national origin group; and</p>\n<p>(6)   name that is associated with a national origin group.</p>\n<p>(b) “National origin groups” include, but are not limited to, ethnic groups, geographic places of origin, and countries that are not presently in existence.</p>\n<p>(c) “Undocumented applicant or employee” means an applicant or employee who lacks legal authorization under federal law to be present and/or to work in the United States.</p>\n<p><em>Retaliation</em><br>\nRetaliation against any individual because the individual has opposed discrimination or harassment on the basis of any protected category, has participated in the filing of a complaint, or has testified, assisted, or participated in any other manner in a proceeding in which discrimination, harassment, or retaliation has been alleged is prohibited.</p>\n<p>Retaliation may include, but is not limited to:</p>\n<p>(1) threatening to contact or contacting immigration authorities or a law enforcement agency about the immigration status of the employee, former employee, applicant, or a family member (e.g., spouse, domestic partner, parent, sibling, child, uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, cousin, grandparent, great-grandparent, grandchild, or great-grandchild, by blood, adoption, marriage, or domestic partnership) of the employee, former employee, or applicant; or</p>\n<p>(2) taking adverse action against an employee because the employee updates or attempts to update personal information based on a change of name, social security number, or government-issued employment documents.</p>\n<p><em>Prohibited Conduct (Coworkers, Third Parties, Supervisors and Managers)</em><br>\nThe law prohibits coworkers and third parties, as well as supervisors and managers, with whom the employee comes in contact from engaging in unlawful harassment, discrimination, or retaliation.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Complaint Process</strong></p>\n<p>Employees may complain orally or in writing. The complaint reporting process is described in more detail in Section B above. In addition to those procedures, the parties involved in a harassment, discrimination or related retaliation complaint will receive a designation of confidentiality, to the extent possible. Confidentiality will be kept by Middlebury to the extent possible, although Middlebury cannot promise absolute confidentiality.</p>\n<p>When Middlebury receives allegations of misconduct under this policy, it will conduct a fair, timely, and thorough investigation and reach reasonable conclusions based on the evidence presented.</p>\n<p>Supervisors must report any complaints of misconduct under this policy to a Human Relations Officer so that Middlebury can try to resolve the claim internally. (This provision does not preclude employees from filing complaints with external agencies. See the Civil Rights and Title IX website for more information.).</p>\n<p>If at the end of the investigation misconduct under this policy is found, appropriate remedial measures shall be taken.</p>\n<p>The investigation will be documented, and the Human Relations Officer will track the investigation for reasonable progress.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Dissemination of the Policy</strong></p>\n<p>This addendum, along with the full text of Middlebury’s <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin\">Non-Discrimination</a> <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Investigations &#x26; Resolutions Procedure</span>, will be disseminated to all California employees via email with an acknowledgement return form.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>C. Policy on Consensual Relationships Between Faculty and Staff Members and Students</h2>\n<p>The integrity and trust of the faculty-student relationship is central to Middlebury’s educational mission.  Amorous relationships, defined as any dating, sexual, or other romantic relationship of any length between a faculty member and a student, even if they are not directly in any advisory or teaching role, involve a power differential, and therefore raise serious questions about unfair grading or other imbalanced evaluation practices, conflicts of interest, favoritism and bias. These concerns have an adverse impact on the educational environment of other students, as well as the student directly involved.</p>\n<p>A seemingly consensual relationship between any employee with a student may meet the legal definition of sexual harassment, as lack of mutual consent may be inferred from the power differential between the employee – whether faculty or staff – and a student. Accordingly, amorous relationships between all Middlebury employees – faculty and staff – and all students enrolled in any Middlebury program are prohibited.</p>\n<p>In exceptional cases falling outside of the anticipated scope of this policy, such as a relationship between an employee and a graduate student in an unrelated Middlebury program, exemptions to this policy may be granted by the Vice President for Academic Affairs/Dean of Faculty (“VPAA/DoF”), or their designee(s), for faculty members, and the Vice President of Human Resources (“VPHR”), or their designee(s), for staff members.  Any employee, whether faculty or staff, who wishes to request such an exemption, shall submit a written statement to the VPAA/DoF or the VPHR, as applicable, explaining the reasons for the request. The VPAA/DoF or the VPHR will consult with the student and then respond in writing to the faculty or staff member with their decision and any conditions of approval that may apply, as applicable.</p>\n<p>Questions about this policy shall be directed to the VPAA/DoF for faculty, or the VPHR for staff.</p>\n<p>If Middlebury receives information that a faculty or staff member has violated this policy, the procedures laid out in the applicable misconduct policy shall be followed. If the employee is found to have violated this policy, the faculty or staff member will be subject to all appropriate discipline, including termination, consistent with the procedures of the applicable policy.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>D. Intellectual Inquiry and Debate</h2>\n<p>Middlebury is a community of learners and as such recognizes and affirms that free intellectual inquiry, debate, and constructive dialogue are vital to Middlebury’s academic mission and must be protected even when the views expressed are unpopular or controversial. Middlebury’s <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy\">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> and this Procedure are meant neither to proscribe nor to inhibit discussions, in or out of the classroom, of complex, controversial, or sensitive matters, including sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, race, color, ethnicity, religion, marital status, place of birth, ancestry, national origin, age, or disability, when in the judgment of a reasonable person they arise appropriately and with respect for the dignity of others. Middlebury also recognizes that verbal conduct can be used specifically to intimidate or coerce and to inhibit genuine discourse, free inquiry, and learning. Such abuses are unacceptable. The \"reasonable person standard\" is to be used in judging whether harassment has occurred.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>GLOSSARY</h2>\n<p><strong>Human Relations Officer</strong></p>\n<p>The Human Relations Officer (“HRO”) is the administrator responsible for overseeing investigations and adjudicating complaints under this policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator</strong><br>\nThe Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator is the administrator responsible for receiving initial complaints and concerns about any form of discrimination and/or harassment, as well as coordinating training, outreach, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Complainant</strong></p>\n<p>A complainant is usually an individual who has alleged a violation(s) of Middlebury’s <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy\">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> that can be investigated and adjudicated under this Procedure. In some cases (such as, e.g., cases in which a person involved in an incident of an alleged policy violation does not wish to participate in the process but Middlebury decides that the alleged misconduct needs to be addressed), Middlebury may serve as the complainant or may pursue an investigation and adjudication under this Procedure without a designated complainant. In these cases, Middlebury may extend the full rights of the complainant as defined in this Procedure to affected parties as deemed appropriate by the HRO.</p>\n<p><strong>Respondent</strong></p>\n<p>A respondent is an individual whose alleged conduct is being investigated to determine if it is in violation of the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy\">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> or other Middlebury policies, if applicable. See also B.6.Scope of Oversight of this policy for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>Confidential Resources</strong><br>\nConfidential resources include the staff of the Parton Center for Health and Wellness, the staff of the Chaplain’s office, Middlebury Safe and Confidential Advocates (“MiddSafe” <a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" id=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a>) or other medical, counseling, support or religious personnel and volunteers who are required by law to maintain confidentiality. For more information, see Section A.5. Confidentiality.</p>\n<p><strong>No Contact Order</strong></p>\n<p>When harassment or other forms of interpersonal misconduct have been alleged, or when otherwise deemed appropriate under the circumstances, the vice president for student affairs and dean of students, vice president for academic affairs and dean of language schools, dean of international programs, RDs, Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator, HRO, Public Safety staff, or appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue may issue No Contact Orders to the persons involved, whether or not disciplinary action is taken. A No Contact Order is used to restrict encounters between individuals. While a No Contact Order in and of itself does not constitute discipline and will not appear in an employee’s personnel file or on a student’s disciplinary record, refusal to adhere to the order after written or verbal notification of its terms is prohibited and may result in disciplinary action.</p>\n<p><strong>No Trespass Notice</strong></p>\n<p>A No Trespass Notice prohibits the presence of an individual on Middlebury property, or other properties on which Middlebury programs are occurring. No Trespass Notices are legally enforceable and may lead to the arrest of individuals in violation.</p>\n<p><strong>Days</strong></p>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, “days” indicates calendar days, regardless of whether the majority of Middlebury’s administrative offices are open. “Business days” indicates days on which the majority of Middlebury’s administrative offices are open, and generally connotes Mondays through Fridays.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Appendix A: Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator</h2>\n<p>Inquiries concerning the application of Title IX may be referred to Middlebury’s <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/hro\">Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator</a> or to the United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights.

Pet Policy](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/commun-policies/pets)).\n\n**A.      <span>Service Animals</span>**\n\nThe Department of Justice defines service animals as **\"dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities.\"** Examples of such work or tasks include guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pulling a wheelchair, alerting and protecting a person who is having a seizure, reminding a person with mental illness to take prescribed medications, calming a person with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during an anxiety attack, or performing other duties. Service animals are working animals, not pets. The work or task a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person’s disability. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA. This definition does not affect or limit the broader definition of “assistance animal” under the Fair Housing Act [FHA].” (see policies for assistance animals in section B below)\n\nService animals need not have special certification or identification in order to qualify as such. They need only be required because of a disability and to be trained to work or perform a task. If it is not readily apparent what work an animal performs, Middlebury personnel will limit inquiries to only two questions, which are:\n\n1)      Is this animal a service animal required because of a disability?\n\n2)      What task or work has this animal been trained to perform?\n\nService animals shall be allowed into any area of the campus that students or other handlers may go including the classrooms, libraries, museums, dining halls, etc., but must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animal’s work or the individual’s disability prevents using these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or other effective controls.\n\nMiddlebury encourages students, faculty, and staff to register their service animals with the College.\n\n**B.      <span>Assistance Animals</span>**\n\nThe definition of assistance animals under the FHA (Fair Housing Act) and for the purposes of Middlebury’s policies is broader than the definition of \"service animal\" under the ADA, and may include animals that work, provide assistance, or perform tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability, but do not meet the ADA definition of \"service animal\" as defined above. Assistance animals can also provide emotional support that alleviates one or more identified symptoms of a person's disability. An assistance animal is not a pet.\n\nThe United States Department of Housing and Urban Development applies the FHA to numerous housing situations including dorms and residence halls on college and university campuses. It requires such entities to provide _reasonable accommodations_ for people with disabilities living in dorms and residence halls. Assistance animals are considered a reasonable accommodation under the FHA.\n\nBecause assistance animals do not qualify as service animals under the ADA, they are only allowed in the room and building of the student, faculty or staff member who has been approved for reasonable accommodation. They will be allowed in outdoor spaces under proper handling when appropriate, but they are not allowed in other rooms or buildings on campus.\n\n**i.  Reasonable Accommodation Request for Assistance Animals**\n\nIn order to request a reasonable accommodation to possess an assistance animal in residence halls on campus, a person must initiate the accommodation process by contacting the appropriate resource:\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span>Students</span></span>**\n\n<span>Jodi Litchfield, ADA Coordinator  \n</span><span>Disability Resource Center (DRC)  \n</span><span>[litchfie@middlebury.edu](mailto:litchfie@middlebury.edu)  \n</span><span>(802) 443-5936  \n</span><span>Service Building 222</span>\n\n<span></span>**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span>Faculty or Staff</span></span>**\n\n<span>Patty Saunders, Disability and Leave Specialist  \n</span><span>Human Resources  \n</span><span>[patricia@middlebury.edu](mailto:patricia@middlebury.edu)  \n</span><span>(802) 443-5338  \n</span><span>Marble Works 201</span>\n\nEach request to possess an assistance animal in residence halls will be evaluated on an individualized basis using the general policies applicable to all reasonable accommodation requests.\n\nIf reasonable accommodation of an assistance animal is approved by Middlebury, each academic year or every summer,  assistance animals must be registered with the College (SAS or Human Resources). A denial for reasonable accommodation may be appealed by following the procedures outlined in the [ADA policy](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/diversity-inclusivity/american-disability-act/policy#Appeals).

The vaccination tag and license must be worn by the animal at all times.\n\n**iii.  Removal of an Animal**\n\nMiddlebury maintains the right to remove an animal under certain circumstances if:\n\n-the animal is not housebroken,\n\n-is not under the direct care and supervision of the owner/handler,\n\n-the animal is out of control and the owner/handler does not take effective action to control it,\n\n-if it is not vaccinated or licensed,\n\n-if it causes disturbances such as noise, barking, or excessive odors, or\n\n-if it poses a direct threat to any member of the Middlebury community.\n\n_Updated: March 29, 2019_\n","excerpt":"This policy addresses Service Animals and Assistance Animals, as defined below, while they are on campus.

Definitions**\n\n**a. \"Students.\"** \"Students\" are defined as those individuals who have applied for admission to Middlebury, were admitted, and are or have been enrolled in classes for credit in a Middlebury program. FERPA does not apply to records of applicants for admission who are denied acceptance or, if accepted, do not enroll in classes for credit. In addition, rights are not given by FERPA to students enrolled in one component of Middlebury who seek to be admitted in another component (_e.g_., a student who is enrolled in the undergraduate College, but is denied admission to one of the graduate programs, has education records at the College but not the graduate program).\n\n**b. \"Education Records.\"** \"Education records\" are those records, in hard copy or digital form, that are directly related to a student and that are maintained by Middlebury or by an official who serves Middlebury in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research,  support staff or other position.\n\n\"Education records\" do not include:\n\ni. Records of personnel that are in the sole possession of the maker, _e.g._, a faculty member's grade book, or a dean's advising notes, or a temporary substitute. Shared information within an office or unit will be considered an \"education record\" subject to FERPA.\n\nii. Records relating to individuals who are employed by Middlebury that are made and maintained in the normal course of business and relate exclusively to individuals in their capacity as employees, and are not available for any other purpose.\n\niii. Records relating to a student that are (1) created or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional acting in his or her professional capacity or assisting in a paraprofessional capacity; (2) used solely in connection with the provision of treatment to the student; and (3) not disclosed to anyone other than individuals providing such treatment (or to a physician or other appropriate professional of the student's choice).\n\niv. Records that contain only information relating to a person after that person is no longer a student at Middlebury (_e.g_., information gathered on the accomplishments of alumni).\n\nv. Records created and maintained by the Middlebury College Department of Public Safety or the Middlebury Institute’s Campus Security Department for law enforcement purposes.\n\nvi. Attorney-client privileged records, such as communications for the purpose of seeking or receiving legal advice on behalf of Middlebury.\n\nvii. Any other records excluded from the definition of Education Records in FERPA.\n\n**c. \"Directory Information.\"** Middlebury determines the following to be student \"directory information,\" which may be available to the public if the student has not restricted its release:\n\nName   \nHome address (while enrolled at Middlebury)   \nCampus address (if applicable)  \nE-mail address  \nPhotograph  \nDates of attendance and graduation  \nClass standing, e.g., first-year student, sophomore, junior, or senior  \nMajor field(s) of study  \nDegrees received   \nHonors and awards received\n\n\"Directory information\" for purposes of FERPA is **not **the same as the information that is available in on-line Middlebury directories.\n\nStudents may opt out of any or all elements of “directory information” identified above, by contacting the Registrar (Vermont) or Records Office (California).\n\n**2\\. General Principles**\n\n**a. Confidentiality.** FERPA provides that education records and personally identifiable information about a student may not be disclosed without the student's written consent unless disclosure is permitted by certain exceptions under FERPA.\n\nThe student's written, signed consent must:\n\n-- Specify the records to be released;\n\n-- Identify the party or class of parties to whom the records should be released;\n\n-- Indicate the reason for the release.\n\n**b. Access.** FERPA provides that students are permitted to inspect their own education records. A student has the right to:\n\n-- Inspect and review his or her education records;\n\n-- Request an amendment to an education record if the student believes there is an inaccuracy;\n\n-- Restrict the release of his or her \"directory information\" from public access;\n\n-- File a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education if he or she feels Middlebury has failed to comply with FERPA.\n\n**c. Administering Office.** The <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">[Office of the Registrar](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/academic/records)</span> is responsible for the administration of this policy for all Middlebury programs other than the Institute. The Records Office is responsible for the administration of this policy at the Middlebury Institute. Students and others who have questions regarding the treatment of specific information in a specific circumstance should contact a staff member in the appropriate Office.\n\n**3\\. Confidentiality**\n\nFERPA generally prohibits the release of confidential personally identifiable student data from education records, with limited exceptions that include \"directory information\" (see below), without the student's written, signed consent.\n\nPersonally identifiable student data, other than \"directory information\" for students who have not restricted its release, are confidential. Examples of confidential information include, but are not limited to, social security number, date of birth, ethnicity, gender, country of citizenship, class schedules (including meeting times and locations), grades, grade point averages, and parents' or guardians' names and addresses.\n\nFERPA provides certain exceptions for the release of personally identifiable education record information without the student's written consent. These exceptions include:\n\n*Directory Information.* “Directory information,” as defined in section 1.c. above, may be made available to the public if the student has not restricted its release.\n\nMiddlebury will honor requests to withhold any one or more elements of “directory information.”\n\nStudents should consider very carefully the consequences of any decision to withhold <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">all</span> “directory information.” When a student instructs Middlebury not to release any “directory information,” any future requests for such information from persons or organizations outside Middlebury will be refused, unless a legal exception applies, or unless the student subsequently revokes the restriction.\n\nRequests for non-disclosure must be submitted in writing to the Office of the Registrar at Middlebury College or the Record Office at the Middlebury Institute. Forms for making such requests may be obtained from the appropriate Office.\n\n*Legitimate Educational Interest.* Personally identifiable education record information may be disclosed without the student's written consent to a Middlebury official with a legitimate educational interest in the record. A Middlebury official is a person employed by Middlebury in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, support staff, or other position (including public safety and health staff at the College and Campus Security staff at the Institute); a person or company with whom Middlebury has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. An employee has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.\n\n*Other Exceptions.* Education record information may be disclosed without the student's written consent in various instances, including:\n\na) To the student;\n\nb) If it is \"directory information\" and the student has not restricted its release;\n\nc) If properly subpoenaed pursuant to a judicial, legislative, or administrative proceeding, in which case Middlebury will make a reasonable attempt to notify the student of the subpoena, in cases where FERPA applies, prior to the release of the information, unless the subpoena specifically directs that the student is not to be notified;\n\nd) In connection with the student's application or receipt of financial aid as necessary to determine the eligibility, amount or conditions of the financial aid, or to enforce the terms or conditions of the aid;\n\ne) In connection with audits or evaluation of federal or state supported educational programs requiring disclosure of information;\n\nf) To effect collection of past due financial obligations to Middlebury;\n\ng) To authorized representatives of the Comptroller General of the United States, the Attorney General of the United States, the Secretary of the Department of Education, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services bureau of the Department of Homeland Security (with respect to international students), or state or local educational authorities;\n\nh) To the Veterans Administration to determine compliance with educational assistance;\n\ni) In connection with a health or safety emergency as determined by Middlebury;\n\nj) In certain circumstances to parents of financially-dependent students, at Middlebury’s discretion;\n\nk) To officials of another school or institution of postsecondary education where the student seeks or intends to enroll, or where the student is already enrolled provided the disclosure is for purposes related to the student's enrollment or transfer.\n\n**4\\. Access**\n\nA student has the right to inspect and review his or her education records within 45 days of submitting a written request to Middlebury for such access.\n\nMiddlebury College students wishing to review their records should submit to the Office of the Registrar a written notice to that effect. Registrar staff will notify the student of a convenient time for the review. Students at the Institute should submit to the Records Office a written notice to that effect. The Records Office will notify the student of a convenient time for the review.\n\nFERPA does not provide the student with the right to access certain records, including:\n\n-- Parents' financial records used for financial aid purposes.\n\n-- Confidential letters and statements of recommendation placed in the student's education record prior to January 1, 1975, or confidential recommendations to which the student has given prior written waiver of access and which are used for job placement, admission, or award purposes.\n\n-- Records that fall into one or more exclusion from the definition of “education records.”\n\n**5\\. Amendment of Records**\n\nA student may request amendment of the student's education records that the student believes are inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student's privacy rights.\n\nA request for amendment of a student's education record should be submitted in writing by the student. The request should state what record the student believes is inaccurate or identify the part of a record the student wants changed, and should state why the student believes the record is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student's privacy rights. If Middlebury decides not to amend a record as requested, Middlebury will notify the student of its decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the issue. Additional information regarding a hearing procedure will be provided to the student when notified of such decisions.\n\nFERPA was not intended to provide a process to be used by students to question substantive judgments that are correctly recorded. The FERPA rights of challenge are not intended to allow a student to contest, for example, a grade in a course because he or she felt a higher grade should have been assigned. FERPA is intended to ensure the factual and accurate nature of the information in the student's education records and the student's right to verify that information.\n\nIf Middlebury decides, as a result of a hearing, not to amend the education record in accordance with the student's request, the student may place a written statement in the record commenting upon the information therein, and/or setting forth any reason for disagreement with the institutional decision not to amend the record. Such a statement will become part of the student's education record and will be disclosed with it.\n\n**6\\. Complaints**\n\nA student has the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the College to comply with requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20202-5920.\n","excerpt":"The federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) ensures students can have access to education records maintained by Middlebury…","html":"<p>The federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) ensures students can have access to education records maintained by Middlebury and defines conditions under which those records may be disclosed to others.</p>\n<p><strong>1.

Administering Office.</strong> The <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/academic/records\">Office of the Registrar</a></span> is responsible for the administration of this policy for all Middlebury programs other than the Institute. The Records Office is responsible for the administration of this policy at the Middlebury Institute. Students and others who have questions regarding the treatment of specific information in a specific circumstance should contact a staff member in the appropriate Office.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Confidentiality</strong></p>\n<p>FERPA generally prohibits the release of confidential personally identifiable student data from education records, with limited exceptions that include \"directory information\" (see below), without the student's written, signed consent.</p>\n<p>Personally identifiable student data, other than \"directory information\" for students who have not restricted its release, are confidential. Examples of confidential information include, but are not limited to, social security number, date of birth, ethnicity, gender, country of citizenship, class schedules (including meeting times and locations), grades, grade point averages, and parents' or guardians' names and addresses.</p>\n<p>FERPA provides certain exceptions for the release of personally identifiable education record information without the student's written consent. These exceptions include:</p>\n<p><em>Directory Information.</em> “Directory information,” as defined in section 1.c. above, may be made available to the public if the student has not restricted its release.</p>\n<p>Middlebury will honor requests to withhold any one or more elements of “directory information.”</p>\n<p>Students should consider very carefully the consequences of any decision to withhold <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">all</span> “directory information.” When a student instructs Middlebury not to release any “directory information,” any future requests for such information from persons or organizations outside Middlebury will be refused, unless a legal exception applies, or unless the student subsequently revokes the restriction.</p>\n<p>Requests for non-disclosure must be submitted in writing to the Office of the Registrar at Middlebury College or the Record Office at the Middlebury Institute. Forms for making such requests may be obtained from the appropriate Office.</p>\n<p><em>Legitimate Educational Interest.</em> Personally identifiable education record information may be disclosed without the student's written consent to a Middlebury official with a legitimate educational interest in the record. A Middlebury official is a person employed by Middlebury in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, support staff, or other position (including public safety and health staff at the College and Campus Security staff at the Institute); a person or company with whom Middlebury has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. An employee has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.</p>\n<p><em>Other Exceptions.</em> Education record information may be disclosed without the student's written consent in various instances, including:</p>\n<p>a) To the student;</p>\n<p>b) If it is \"directory information\" and the student has not restricted its release;</p>\n<p>c) If properly subpoenaed pursuant to a judicial, legislative, or administrative proceeding, in which case Middlebury will make a reasonable attempt to notify the student of the subpoena, in cases where FERPA applies, prior to the release of the information, unless the subpoena specifically directs that the student is not to be notified;</p>\n<p>d) In connection with the student's application or receipt of financial aid as necessary to determine the eligibility, amount or conditions of the financial aid, or to enforce the terms or conditions of the aid;</p>\n<p>e) In connection with audits or evaluation of federal or state supported educational programs requiring disclosure of information;</p>\n<p>f) To effect collection of past due financial obligations to Middlebury;</p>\n<p>g) To authorized representatives of the Comptroller General of the United States, the Attorney General of the United States, the Secretary of the Department of Education, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services bureau of the Department of Homeland Security (with respect to international students), or state or local educational authorities;</p>\n<p>h) To the Veterans Administration to determine compliance with educational assistance;</p>\n<p>i) In connection with a health or safety emergency as determined by Middlebury;</p>\n<p>j) In certain circumstances to parents of financially-dependent students, at Middlebury’s discretion;</p>\n<p>k) To officials of another school or institution of postsecondary education where the student seeks or intends to enroll, or where the student is already enrolled provided the disclosure is for purposes related to the student's enrollment or transfer.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Access</strong></p>\n<p>A student has the right to inspect and review his or her education records within 45 days of submitting a written request to Middlebury for such access.</p>\n<p>Middlebury College students wishing to review their records should submit to the Office of the Registrar a written notice to that effect. Registrar staff will notify the student of a convenient time for the review. Students at the Institute should submit to the Records Office a written notice to that effect. The Records Office will notify the student of a convenient time for the review.</p>\n<p>FERPA does not provide the student with the right to access certain records, including:</p>\n<p>-- Parents' financial records used for financial aid purposes.</p>\n<p>-- Confidential letters and statements of recommendation placed in the student's education record prior to January 1, 1975, or confidential recommendations to which the student has given prior written waiver of access and which are used for job placement, admission, or award purposes.</p>\n<p>-- Records that fall into one or more exclusion from the definition of “education records.”</p>\n<p><strong>5. Amendment of Records</strong></p>\n<p>A student may request amendment of the student's education records that the student believes are inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student's privacy rights.</p>\n<p>A request for amendment of a student's education record should be submitted in writing by the student. The request should state what record the student believes is inaccurate or identify the part of a record the student wants changed, and should state why the student believes the record is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student's privacy rights. If Middlebury decides not to amend a record as requested, Middlebury will notify the student of its decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the issue. Additional information regarding a hearing procedure will be provided to the student when notified of such decisions.</p>\n<p>FERPA was not intended to provide a process to be used by students to question substantive judgments that are correctly recorded. The FERPA rights of challenge are not intended to allow a student to contest, for example, a grade in a course because he or she felt a higher grade should have been assigned. FERPA is intended to ensure the factual and accurate nature of the information in the student's education records and the student's right to verify that information.</p>\n<p>If Middlebury decides, as a result of a hearing, not to amend the education record in accordance with the student's request, the student may place a written statement in the record commenting upon the information therein, and/or setting forth any reason for disagreement with the institutional decision not to amend the record. Such a statement will become part of the student's education record and will be disclosed with it.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Complaints</strong></p>\n<p>A student has the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the College to comply with requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20202-5920.</p>"},"b7a67222-d49d-528e-8e16-13a224d658a4":{"id":"b7a67222-d49d-528e-8e16-13a224d658a4","slug":"/pages/i-policies-for-all/records","title":"E.

Hearings and Determinations of Responsibility  \nVI. Sanctioning  \nVII. Appeals  \nVIII. Admission of Responsibility  \nIX. Informal Resolution  \nX. Training of Individuals Conducting Investigations and Adjudications and Facilitating Informal Resolution Processes  \nXI. Record Keeping  \nAPPENDIX A\n\n## I. What This Procedure Covers\n\nThis Title IX Formal Grievance Procedure (“Procedure”) applies to instances of Sexual Harassment <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">(</span>as defined by May 2020 U.S. Department of Education Title IX regulation) which occur on or after August 14, 2020.  All references to Sexual Harassment within this Procedure are intended to apply to and comply with the definition of Sexual Harassment as defined by Department of Education in its Title IX regulation.\n\nMiddlebury may, in exceptional circumstances, vary from this Procedure.  So long as such a variation is consistent with Title IX regulations and allows for fundamental fairness in the processes followed, variations from this process under those circumstances will not invalidate an outcome.\n\nExcept as otherwise specified herein, this Procedure applies to faculty, staff and students, as well as to others who participate or attempt to participate in Middlebury’s programs and activities.  This includes the undergraduate college, the Language Schools, the School of the Environment, MiddCore, Bread Loaf School of English, Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference, and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey (\"the Institute\").<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" id=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>  Faculty and staff are, together, referred to as “Employee” or “Employees” in this Procedure.\n\nThis Procedure applies to Sexual Harassment as defined by the Department of Education and as set forth in the [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy \"Non-discrimination\") so long as the following conditions are met:\n\n(i) The alleged conduct was perpetrated against a person in the United States; and\n\n(ii) The alleged conduct took place within Middlebury’s programs and activities, meaning that the conduct occurred in a location, at an event, or in a circumstance where Middlebury exercises substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the conduct occurs, or in any building owned or controlled by a student organization recognized by Middlebury; <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">and</span>, the Complainant is participating in or attempting to participate in Middlebury’s programs or activities.\n\nConduct that occurs off campus in locations or at events without direction or control by Middlebury does not meet the definition of occurring in “a program or activity of Middlebury”.  Such conduct may be prohibited under other Middlebury policies, including the Non-Discrimination Policy provisions addressing forms of discrimination other than Title IX Sexual Harassment, and is addressed using different procedures.  Only behavior meeting the definitional requirements of this section will be addressed utilizing this Procedure.  Where a complaint alleges other Middlebury policy violations arising out of the same facts and circumstances as allegations that must be addressed utilizing this Procedure, Middlebury may, in its discretion, address those other alleged violations through this Procedure.\n\nConduct that occurred prior to August 14, 2020 will be investigated and adjudicated consistent with the procedures detailed in the [SMDVS Policy](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook_old/smdvs \"SMDVS\") and/or the [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin \"AHD\") in effect during Academic Year 2019-2020, prior to the August 14, 2020 effective date of the Department of Education’s May 2020 regulations.  However, informal or “adaptable” resolutions may be available to address concerns about alleged conduct under the [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy \"Non-discrimination\") regardless of the date it occurred.\n\n## II. Reporting Title IX Sexual Harassment\n\n**In order to fulfill its commitment to fostering a safe and inclusive learning environment, Middlebury values reporting of all types of sexual harassment, which includes sexual assault.** Any person who believes that they have been subject to Title IX Sexual Harassment, or who has reason to believe that Title IX Sexual Harassment has occurred or is occurring, should report this information to the immediate attention of the Civil Rights and Title IX (“CRTIX”) Coordinator.  The CRTIX Coordinator is:\n\nMarti McCaleb  \nCivil Rights and Title IX Coordinator  \nMiddlebury College  \n213 Service Building  \n84 S Service Rd  \nMiddlebury, VT 05753  \n(802) 443-2147  \n[mmccaleb@middlebury.edu](mailto:mmccaleb@middlebury.edu)\n\nA report or complaint may be made verbally (in person, by phone, or videoconferencing) during applicable business hours, or in writing (via mail or email) 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. You may also report using the online reporting tool at go/report. Please note that while a report may be made anonymously, this will limit Middlebury’s ability to take action to provide supportive measures or to address the situation.\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Which Middlebury Employees Must Report Sexual Harassment?</span>**\n\n**With the exception of certain persons designated as “Confidential Resources,” as described below, all Middlebury employees must report any incident that could constitute Sexual Harassment involving a Middlebury student, employee or other covered person, to the CRTIX Coordinator and/or an HRO**. The report should include relevant details about the incident of which they are aware, including the names of the parties, any witnesses, and any other relevant facts, including the date, time, and specific location of the alleged incident. To the extent possible, information reported will be shared with others only to the extent necessary to respond to the situation and support the parties and in accordance with state and federal law. Examples include individuals who are responsible for processing, investigating, adjudicating, and responding to sexual misconduct, domestic and dating violence and  misconduct, stalking and/or related retaliation reports; deans; program directors; supervisors; Human Resources staff; and Department of Public Safety or other campus security personnel who are responsible for reporting campus crime statistics and issuing timely warnings under the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act.\n\n## A. Who Are Confidential Resources?\n\nConfidential Resources include the staff of the Parton Center for Health and Wellness, the staff of the Chaplain’s office, Middlebury Safe and Confidential Advocates (“MiddSafe”)<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" id=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a> or other medical, counseling, support or religious personnel and volunteers who are required by law to maintain confidentiality.\n\nMiddlebury encourages individuals to use confidential services.  Individuals who seek those services should understand that confidentiality is not absolute and that those resources may have ethical or legal obligations to report certain information to others.  As one example, Confidential Resources are typically obligated under state law to report instances of child abuse.\n\n## B. Participation and Cooperation\n\nAll members of Middlebury’s community covered by the Non-Discrimination Policy and identified in connection with an investigation under this Procedure are expected to cooperate and provide complete, accurate, and truthful information. Middlebury prohibits intentionally making a false report or providing false or misleading information in any investigation under this Procedure. Complainants will not be deemed to have provided false or misleading information under this Procedure if their factual allegations are intended to be truthful and are made in good faith, regardless of whether the conduct complained of is ultimately found to constitute a policy violation.\n\nWitnesses may be expected to sign statements or other documents memorializing the information provided in the course of the investigation and may be asked to keep the substance of the investigation interview confidential.\n\n## C. Supportive Measures (Previously called “Interim Measures”)\n\n_Supportive measures_ are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to the complainant or the respondent before or after the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been filed. Such measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity without unreasonably burdening the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the recipient’s educational environment, or deter sexual harassment. Supportive measures may include but are not limited to:\n\n- counseling;\n- academic accommodations, such as extensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments, course changes or late drops, or other arrangements as appropriate (see the Academics: Course Registration and Conduct of Courses and Grades and Transcripts sections of the Handbook for more information);\n- modifications of work or class schedules;\n- campus escort services;\n- mutual restrictions on contact between the parties;\n- Residential accommodations, including but not limited to arranging for new housing, or providing temporary housing options, as appropriate;\n- changes in work locations;\n- leaves of absence;\n- increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus;\n- Changing transportation or working arrangements or providing other employment accommodations, as appropriate;\n- Assisting the individual in accessing support services, including, as available, victim advocacy, academic support, counseling, disability, health or mental health services, visa and immigration assistance, student financial aid services, and legal assistance both on and off campus, as applicable (see Appendix C for a list of resources);\n- No Trespass Notices prohibiting the presence of an individual on Middlebury property, and/or other properties on which Middlebury programs are occurring;\n- Informing the individual of the right to report a crime to local law enforcement and/or seek orders of protection, restraining orders, or relief from abuse orders from United States courts or courts outside of the United States as applicable, and providing assistance if the individual wishes to do so. Middlebury will also work with complainants and others as appropriate to respect and implement the requirements of such orders on premises that it owns or controls, as necessary and appropriate;\n- and other similar measures.\n\nIt is not necessary to file a complaint with Middlebury, participate in an adjudication process, or file a criminal complaint in order to request supportive measures from Middlebury.\n\nWhere a complainant reportedly subjected to Sexual Harassment makes a request for supportive measures like those described above, Middlebury will consider the request and provide those Supportive measures which are reasonably available and reasonably allow for the preservation or restoration of access to or participation in Middlebury programs.\n\nStudents or employees seeking supportive measures <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"></span> should direct their request to the CRTIX Coordinator, HROs, Human Resources, dean, or program director, as appropriate. The request will be evaluated and responded to by the CRTIX Coordinator or designee (e.g. HRO<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">s</span>, Commons dean, or program director) after consultation, as needed, with the appropriate authority or authorities for the school or program at issue. The CRTIX Coordinator is ultimately responsible for coordinating the effective implementation of supportive measures. Factors to be considered in determining whether to provide certain supportive measures may include the following:\n\n- the specific need expressed by the party;\n- the severity and/or pervasiveness of the allegations;\n- any continuing effects on the party;\n- whether the parties share the same residence hall, dining hall, class, extracurricular activities, transportation and/or job location;\n- whether other judicial measures have been taken to protect a party or the parties; and.\n- whether other measures are reasonably available to support the individual.\n\nMiddlebury will maintain as confidential any supportive measures provided to a party, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the ability of Middlebury to provide the supportive measures. As such, Middlebury may need to disclose some information about the individual to a third party to provide the supportive measures in a timely manner. The following individuals are typically responsible for determining what information should be disclosed and to whom it should be disclosed: CRTIX Coordinator, an HRO, dean, Public Safety officer or program director. The decision to disclose information will be made after careful consideration of possible alternatives to disclosure and/or limiting the information provided to the third party as much as possible without compromising Middlebury’s ability to provide the supportive measures.\n\n## D. Emergency Removal and Administrative Leave\n\nNothing in this Procedure limits Middlebury’s rights to terminate or suspend the employment of any staff or faculty member under otherwise-applicable Middlebury policies, practices, contracts, or procedures.\n\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">1. Emergency Removal&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n\nWhere there is an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment, Middlebury can remove a respondent from its education program or activity (which may include removing an employee respondent from their employment at Middlebury) and issue any necessary related no-trespass and no-contact orders.  Middlebury will make the decision to remove a respondent from its education program or activity based on an individualized assessment and risk analysis. If Middlebury makes such a decision, the respondent will be provided with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following the removal.\n\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">2. Administrative Leave for Employees&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n\nMiddlebury may place employee respondents (non-students) on paid administrative leave during the pendency of an investigation and resolution process as outlined below. Middlebury reserves the right to place an employee respondent (non-student) on unpaid administrative leave during the pendency of an investigation and resolution process. In those instances in which Middlebury determines that an administrative leave will be unpaid and the respondent was not offered the opportunity to challenge the suspension without pay before it was imposed through some other process, the respondent may present a written challenge regarding the need for or the adequacy of the unpaid administrative leave to the CRTIX Coordinator. Once a written challenge of unpaid administrative leave is received, the CRTIX Coordinator will involve the relevant Middlebury leadership, which may include Human Resources and/or department leaders, and schedule a virtual or in-person meeting with the respondent prior to making a determination.\n\n## E. Options to Pursue Criminal or Legal Actions (Reporting Outside of Middlebury)\n\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">1. Criminal Complaints</h3>\n\nAny student or employee may pursue criminal charges with local, state, or federal law enforcement agencies. Middlebury will offer and, upon request, provide assistance to individuals covered under this procedure with notifying law enforcement agencies. These options are available regardless of whether an individual chooses to file a complaint with Middlebury. Individuals have the option to notify such agencies with or without assistance from Middlebury, and have the option not to personally notify such authorities.\n\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">2. Orders of Protection</h3>\n\nMiddlebury does not have the authority to issue Relief From Abuse Orders, Orders of Protection or Restraining Orders as these are granted by the court system. Individuals who have experienced Title IX Sexual Harassment may be eligible to pursue Orders of Protection, Restraining Orders and/or Relief from Abuse Orders from courts in the United States or courts outside of the United States as applicable. Middlebury will offer its support to individuals if they request Middlebury’s assistance with making contact with law enforcement authorities and other external resources to seek such orders. Middlebury will respect such orders to the extent applicable.\n\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">3. Assistance by Middlebury</h3>\n\nRequests for assistance with contacting law enforcement authorities or obtaining an Order of Protection, a Relief from Abuse Order, a Restraining Order or other lawful order may be made in person, via email, phone or teleconference to the CRTIX Coordinator, an HRO, or Public Safety For additional information regarding making reports to the police and/or obtaining an Order of Protection, Restraining Order, or Relief from Abuse Order.\n\n## III. FORMAL COMPLAINTS/GRIEVANCES & PRE-INVESTIGATION\n\nIn addition to the reporting options and access to supportive measures addressed above, a complainant may file a formal written complaint alleging Title IX Sexual Harassment against a respondent and requesting that Middlebury investigate the allegation. At the time of filing a formal complaint, a complainant must be participating in or attempting to participate in Middlebury’s programs or activities. A formal complaint may be filed with the CRTIX Coordinator in person, by mail, or by electronic mail, by using the contact information contained in Section II, above.\n\n## A. Pre-Investigation: Determinations of Applicable Procedures, Dismissals, Transfers and Appeals of Such Determinations\n\n1\\. Middlebury will investigate alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment where a complainant submits a signed or electronically submitted formal complaint to the CRTIX coordinator, requests an investigation, and the signed written complaint meets the requirements of this section. In cases where the complainant does not wish to submit a formal complaint but the CRTIX Coordinator decides in their discretion to sign a complaint and initiate an investigation and resolution process, the CRTIX Coordinator will not be a complainant or otherwise a party to the matter.  Middlebury will terminate the Title IX Sexual Harassment Investigation if a complainant notifies the CRTIX Coordinator in writing that the complainant would like to withdraw the formal complaint.\n\n2\\. When a complainant requests an investigation,\n\n(a) the CRTIX Coordinator will, promptly upon receipt of a report, determine whether:\n\ni) the conduct alleged would, if proved, constitute Title IX Sexual Harassment (i.e., *Quid Pro Quo* Sexual Harassment, Severe, Pervasive and Objectively Offensive Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, or sex-based Domestic Violence, Dating Violence or Stalking) as defined in the Non-Discrimination Policy as Title IX Sexual Harassment;\n\nii) the conduct allegedly occurred in Middlebury’s education program or activity; and\n\niii)  the conduct allegedly occurred in the United States.\n\n(b) the CRTIX Coordinator/HRO or designee may gather additional information as appropriate before making the determinations required by part (a) of this subsection. During any such initial inquiry, all individuals are expected to cooperate.\n\n3\\. If some but not all of the conduct alleged in the complaint satisfies all 3 of these elements and a formal complaint is received from a complainant or signed by the CRTIX Coordinator, Middlebury may choose to address the entire matter through this Title IX Sexual Harassment Procedure (that is, it will as required by federal regulations follow Title IX Sexual Harassment procedures to address the alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment, and it may, to promote efficiency or for other compelling reasons, choose to follow this Title IX Sexual Harassment Procedure to address other prohibited conduct in such mixed cases, so that all related misconduct may be addressed through one investigation and resolution process).\n\n4\\. If it appears based upon initial review or upon information gathered during an investigation that the matter does not satisfy and/or no longer satisfies all 3 of these elements, Middlebury will, as required by Title IX regulations, dismiss the matter from the Title IX Sexual Harassment Procedure, and will transfer it for handling under the Non-Discrimination Investigation and Resolutions Procedure or other Middlebury procedures, as deemed appropriate by Middlebury.\n\n5\\. Even if the allegations of a matter fall within the definition of Title IX Sexual Harassment, Middlebury may (but is not required to) dismiss a formal complaint or any allegations therein if at any time during the investigation or resolution process:\n\n- A complainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the complainant would like to withdraw the formal complaint or any allegations therein;\n- The respondent is no longer enrolled or employed by Middlebury; or\n- Specific circumstances prevent Middlebury from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the formal complaint or allegations therein.\n\n6\\. If a formal complaint is dismissed by Middlebury under the circumstances described above, Middlebury will simultaneously provide to the parties written notice (by electronic or other means) of the dismissal and the reasons for the dismissal, and notice of the parties’ opportunity to appeal such dismissal through the Title IX Sexual Harassment appeal procedures outlined below.\n\n7\\. If the respondent is a Student and an Employee, the CRTIX Coordinator will determine which procedures apply based upon the facts and circumstances, such as whether the respondent’s status as a Student or an Employee predominates in the context of the Prohibited Conduct. If a Student-Employee is found to have engaged in Prohibited Conduct, the Student-Employee may be subject to sanctions both in connection with their employment and in connection with their student status, as appropriate under these and other applicable procedures.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Additional Policy Violations:</span>\n\n1\\. If the CRTIX Coordinator/HRO becomes aware, at any point prior to or during the investigation and adjudication process, of additional allegations against the respondent that, if proven, could constitute violations of other non-academic policies, including harassment or discrimination investigated under Middlebury’s Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy, these allegations may, at Middlebury’s discretion, be investigated and adjudicated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.  In matters involving Employees, where the CRTIX Coordinator/HRO becomes aware of additional allegations of violations of Middlebury Policy, those concerns will be reported to the Employee’s appropriate supervisory authority (e.g., VPAA/dean of the Faculty, VPAA/dean of the Institute, VPAA/dean of the Language Schools, Executive Vice President/Provost), who, in consultation with Human Resources,  will consider whether and how to proceed under the relevant Faculty Handbook or Employee Handbook procedures and/or applicable contracts or policies.\n\n2\\. If one party alleges that another party violated a No Contact Order (NCO) or No Trespass Notice (NTN) and makes the allegations at a time when they can be evaluated during an ongoing Title IX Sexual Harassment investigation/adjudication or after the Title IX Sexual Harassment investigation/adjudication process has been completed, the HRO or HRO’s designee will determine how to proceed.\n\n3\\. If the HRO does not assume jurisdiction, the allegations may be addressed through Middlebury's conduct process for the appropriate school or program, or through the appropriate employment process. Alternatively, the HRO may designate an appropriate Middlebury official(s) to oversee and/or conduct an investigation and adjudicate the matter.  If a violation of a NCO or NTN is found, the matter will be referred to the appropriate supervisory authority for discipline and/or other appropriate action in accordance with existing handbook policies.\n\n4\\. If the HRO assumes jurisdiction over the allegations and deems an investigation to be necessary, the HRO will determine the scope, process, and timeline of the NCO/NTN investigation and adjudication, which may not necessarily follow the procedures outlined in this Title IX Investigation & Resolutions Procedure, if the HRO determines that using other procedures is more appropriate. The HRO has the discretion to determine whether an advisor of choice may be present at any processes or meetings related to an NCO/NTN investigation, depending on the circumstances. Both parties will have an opportunity to review and respond to all evidence relevant to the NCO/NTN investigation according to a timeline established by the HRO. The HRO will make a finding and will refer the matter to the appropriate sanctioning authority if a violation is found. Should the HRO determine that an NCO/NTN violation may also constitute retaliation, the parties will be notified in writing that retaliation will be added to the policies under consideration in the Title IX Sexual Harassment investigation or be part of a subsequent investigation, as applicable.\n\n5\\. In all cases the parties will receive written notification if the CRTIX Coordinator/HRO determines that additional possible policy violations will be investigated and adjudicated in accordance with the Title IX procedures set forth herein or through a different set of procedures.\n\n## B. Bias\n\nIf either party is concerned that an official involved in the investigation or adjudication (such as, for example, an investigator, CRTIX Coordinator, or HRO) may be biased or have a conflict of interest, the party should share their concerns immediately. Concerns of this nature about the investigator should be shared with the CRTIX Coordinator; concerns about the CRTIX Coordinator or an HRO should be shared with the Chief Diversity Officer. The official with whom the concern is shared will consider the concern and inform the parties of a decision as to whether any related action is appropriate and whether an alternate will be appointed. If an alternate investigator, HRO, or CRTIX Coordinator is appointed, the alternate shall have the same authority as the originally designated official.\n\n## C. Additional Procedures for Dismissed Complaints.\n\nIf the CRTIX Coordinator dismisses a complaint under subsections (A)(1) or (A)(6) of this Part III, the CRTIX must promptly:\n\n1.  inform the parties that the dismissal is appealable in accordance with the appeal provisions described in this Procedure, below; and\n2.  consider whether the conduct alleged, if proved, would constitute a violation of Middlebury policy that should be investigated and adjudicated in accordance with another Middlebury policy, and initiate applicable procedures accordingly.\n\n## IV. INVESTIGATIONS\n\n## A. Investigations Procedure\n\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">1. General Investigation Provisions</h3>\n\nAs required by the 2020 Title IX regulations, in investigations conducted under this Procedure, the following provisions will apply:\n\n- The burden of proof and the burden of gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination regarding responsibility rest on Middlebury and not on the parties;\n- Parties will have an equal opportunity to present witnesses, including fact and expert witnesses, and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence;\n- Parties are not restricted in their ability to discuss the allegations under investigation or to gather and present relevant evidence; and\n- When a party is invited or expected to attend a hearing, investigative interview, or other meeting, they will receive written notice of the date, time location, participants, and purpose of such a hearing, investigative interview or meeting, with sufficient time for the party to prepare to participate.\n\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">2. Initial Notice of Investigation</h3>\n\nWhen Middlebury initiates an investigation under this Procedure it will provide to the parties a written notice (by electronic or other means) that includes:\n\n- Information about Middlebury’s formal and informal resolution processes;\n- A statement of the allegations of behavior potentially constituting Title IX Sexual Harassment, including sufficient details known at the time and with sufficient time to prepare a response before any initial post-intake interview. Sufficient details include the identities of the parties involved in the incident, if known, the conduct allegedly constituting Title IX Sexual Harassment, and the date and location of the alleged incident, if known;\n- A statement that the respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct and that a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the grievance process;\n- Information regarding Middlebury’s presumption of good faith reporting and a summary of false complaint information outlined below;\n- Notification that the parties may have an advisor of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney; and\n- Notification that the parties may inspect and review evidence during the investigation and resolution process, as provided below.\n\nIf, in the course of an investigation, Middlebury decides to investigate allegations about any party that are not included in the notice described above, it will provide notice of the additional allegations to the parties whose identities are known.\n\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">3. Consolidation of Formal Complaints</h3>\n\nMiddlebury may consolidate formal complaints of Title IX Sexual Harassment against more than one respondent, or by more than one complainant against one or more respondents, or by one party against the other party, where the allegations of such Title IX Sexual Harassment arise out of the same facts or circumstances. Where a grievance process involves more than one complainant or more than one respondent, references in this section to the singular “party,” “complainant,” or “respondent” include the plural, as applicable.\n\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">4. Disabilities</h3>\n\nStudents registered with the [Disability Resource Center ](https://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/ada)can request accommodations to ensure their full and equal participation in any conduct process and/or proceeding. Accommodation requests may be made directly to the CRTIX Coordinator. Accommodations are determined on an individual basis in consultation with the ADA Coordinators. Employees with disabilities may contact Human Resources.\n\n## B. Conduct of the Investigation\n\n1.  The CRTIX Coordinator will appoint an investigator. In selecting the investigator for a particular matter, the CRTIX Coordinator will take care to select an individual who does not have a conflict of interest or bias against complainants or respondents generally or an individual complainant or respondent. The CRTIX Coordinator will notify the parties of the identity of the investigator and parties may, within three calendar days of such notice, object to the appointment of the investigator by providing a written statement (which may be transmitted electronically) as to why the party believes that the investigator has a conflict of interest or bias. The CRTIX Coordinator will make decisions regarding such objections and the appointment of an alternate investigator, as necessary.\n2.  The investigator is authorized to contact any and all individuals who may have relevant information. The nature and scope of the investigation is within the discretion of the investigator.  The investigator is authorized to access relevant records, except those legally protected as confidential or privileged, and may collect any additional evidence relevant to the complaint. Middlebury recognizes, however, that individuals who are bound by legal privileges may not be able to disclose privileged information, unless an exception applies. The investigator will not access, consider, disclose or otherwise use a party’s privileged records without the party’s voluntary, written consent to do so, and such information will not be deemed relevant to an investigation or adjudication absent the voluntary, written consent of the party.\n3.  The complainant and respondent will be asked to identify, preserve and submit all evidence pertaining to the matter under investigation, and to identify witnesses they believe may have relevant testimony to share. The investigator is not required to consider particular evidence submitted or interview any particular witness, even if identified by one of the parties.\n4.  All participants in the investigation are expected to provide complete, accurate, and truthful information.\n\n## C. Preliminary Report\n\n1.  After the complainant and the respondent have had the opportunity to make their own statement and to identify witnesses and other potential information, and the investigator has completed witness interviews and the gathering of evidence, the investigator will prepare a preliminary report.\n2.  Middlebury will provide each party with an equal opportunity to inspect and review any evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the allegations raised, including the evidence upon which Middlebury does not intend to rely in reaching a determination regarding responsibility and/or which the investigator does not deem relevant, and inculpatory or exculpatory evidence whether obtained from a party or other source, so that each party can meaningfully respond to the evidence prior to conclusion of the investigation. Such evidence will not include privileged records or information that may have been gathered or received during the investigation, absent written consent from the party holding the privilege.\n3.  Middlebury will send to each party and the party’s advisor, if any, the evidence subject to inspection and review in an electronic format or a hard copy.\n4.  Parties and advisors are not permitted to download, print or copy such evidence subject to inspection and review, and are not permitted to re-disclose such evidence without Middlebury’s permission. Parties and advisors will be required to sign an acknowledgment form indicating that they understand these prohibitions. Violations of these prohibitions may subject parties to Middlebury discipline under applicable conduct codes.\n5.  The complainant and the respondent will have an opportunity to review the preliminary report within the same time period and provide written responses to the report.  The complainant and the respondent must submit any comments, feedback, additional documents, evidence, suggested questions for individuals interviewed, requests for additional investigation, names of additional witnesses, or any other information they deem relevant to the investigator, including additional documents or other evidence, within 10 calendar days after the preliminary report is sent to them for review.  The parties' written responses will be considered by the investigator prior to completion of the final investigative report, and some or all of the responses may be attached or otherwise incorporated into the final investigative report.\n6.  In the event that new, relevant information is provided or identified at this stage, the information will be incorporated into the preliminary report as deemed appropriate by the investigator, and the complainant and the respondent will be provided a second opportunity  to review and provide a written response regarding the new information, which the investigator will consider prior to completion of the final investigation report.  Identification of new and relevant information after the parties’ review of the preliminary report is likely to extend the time frame of the investigation.\n\n## D. Final Investigative Report \n\n1.  After considering any written response submitted by either party, or after the 10 calendar day comment period has lapsed without receiving a written response or responses, the investigator will address any relevant issues identified by the complainant and/or the respondent, and as appropriate, pursue any additional investigative steps as needed. The final investigative report will be reviewed for completeness by the CRTIX Coordinator or one HRO (not the hearing officer) before it is issued.\n2.  The final investigative report created by the investigator will fairly summarize relevant evidence and include as exhibits evidentiary materials as deemed appropriate by the investigator;\n3.  The final investigative report will include the investigator’s recommendation as to whether the respondent should be found responsible for violating the policy provisions at issue;\n4.  At least 10 days prior to the hearing referenced below, Middlebury will send to each party and the party’s advisor, if any, the final investigative report and exhibits in an electronic format or a hard copy, for their review and written response; and\n5.  The final investigative report and the parties’ written responses, if any, will be provided to the hearing officer in advance of the hearing.\n\n## V. Hearings and Determinations of Responsibility\n\n## A. In General\n\nLive hearings will be provided as required by the 2020 Title IX regulations. At the request of either party, Middlebury will provide for the hearing to occur with the parties located in separate rooms with technology enabling the hearing officer and parties to simultaneously see and hear the party or the witness answering questions. Live hearings may be conducted with all parties physically present in the same location or, at Middlebury’s discretion, any or all parties, witnesses, and other participants may appear at the live hearing virtually, with technology enabling participants simultaneously to see and hear each other.\n\n## B. Hearing Officers\n\nHearings will be presided over by a hearing officer, who will make the decision by a preponderance of the evidence as to whether or not the respondent violated the policy provisions at issue. The hearing officer has broad authority to determine the process, timing and conduct of a hearing. For example, the hearing officer will determine the order of presentation, timing and overall duration of the hearing, what information and evidence will be heard, what information and questions are relevant to the determination of the matter, and what cross-examination questions will or will not be permitted.\n\nHearing officers, ordinarily one of Middlebury’s HROs, will be appointed by the CRTIX Coordinator. In selecting a hearing officer for a particular matter, the CRTIX Coordinator will take care to select an individual who does not have a conflict of interest or bias against complainants or respondents generally or an individual complainant or respondent. Middlebury will notify the parties of the identity of the hearing officer in advance of the hearing, and parties may, within 3 calendar days of such notice, object to the service of the hearing officer by providing a written statement (which may be transmitted electronically) as to why the party believes that the hearing officer has a conflict of interest or bias. The CRTIX Coordinator or designee will make decisions regarding such objections and the appointment of an alternate hearing officer, as necessary.\n\n## C. Advisors\n\nEach party may have an advisor of their choice present at a hearing for the limited purpose of conducting cross-examination on behalf of that party. Advisors are not required to be attorneys, but attorneys are permitted to serve as advisors. If a party does not have an advisor of their choice present at a hearing, Middlebury will without fee or charge to the party provide an advisor of Middlebury’s choice, for the limited purpose of conducting cross-examination on behalf of that party. No later than 10 calendar days before the hearing, parties should inform the CRTIX Coordinator of the identity of any advisor of choice who will accompany them to the hearing, so that Middlebury will know whether or not it needs to arrange for the presence of a Middlebury-provided advisor, even if the party declines to attend the hearing.\n\nAt a time and manner deemed appropriate by the hearing officer, the advisor for each party will be permitted to ask the other party and any witnesses all relevant cross-examination questions and follow-up questions, including those challenging credibility. Advisors must comply with the conduct expectations for hearings. Except for the limited role of asking cross-examination questions, advisors may not participate actively in the hearing and may not speak or otherwise communicate on the part of the party that the advisor is advising. However, the advisor may consult privately in a non-disruptive manner with their advisee during and/or at a recess in the hearing. Scheduling accommodations generally will not be made for advisors if they unduly delay the process. Middlebury reserves the right to take appropriate action regarding any advisor who disrupts the process, or who does not abide by the restrictions on their participation as determined in the sole discretion of the hearing officer, which may include exclusion of the advisor from the hearing and the appointment of an alternate Middlebury-provided advisor.\n\n## D. Middlebury Faculty and Staff as Advisors \n\nA Middlebury faculty or staff member who agrees to serve as an advisor to a complainant or respondent is not an agent of Middlebury when acting in that capacity and does not speak or act on Middlebury’s behalf while serving as an advisor.  The relationship between a party and their advisor for the TIX Sexual Harassment hearing is not confidential (or privileged), and the faculty or staff member’s duties to Middlebury—including all reporting obligations—remain intact.  Before agreeing to serve as an advisor, faculty and staff members should evaluate whether any conflict or potential conflict of interest may warrant their declining the invitation to serve as an advisor. In addition, only licensed attorneys can provide legal advice. Parties seeking legal advice should consult their attorney.\n\n## E. Requests for Appearance of Witnesses\n\nIf a Party wishes to have an individual appear at the hearing as a witness, they must provide notice of the identity of the proposed witness and a brief description of the subject matter of the witnesses’ testimony to the CRTIX Coordinator or designee at least 10 calendar days before the date of the hearing. The CRTIX Coordinator or designee, in consultation with the hearing officer as necessary, will determine whether the witness is likely to have information that is relevant to the hearing, and if it is determined that the witness is likely to have relevant information, the CRTIX Coordinator or designee will inform the witness that their presence at the hearing is expected. These provisions apply equally to both fact and expert witnesses.\n\n## F. Conduct of Hearings and Relevance\n\nA) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Report to be provided to Hearing Officer</span>\n\nAt or before the hearing, the hearing officer will receive a copy of the investigative report, any attachments thereto, and copies of the parties’ written responses to the investigative report, if any, which will be part of the information of record to be considered by the hearing officer to the extent appropriate in light of the rules regarding evidence to be considered that are outlined below.\n\nB) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">General Order of the Hearing</span>\n\n(i) Subject to the discretion of the hearing officer, hearings will ordinarily begin with introductory remarks by the hearing officer to explain the process, followed by a brief opening statement from any party who wishes to provide one, followed by the hearing officer’s asking relevant initial questions of the parties as deemed appropriate by the hearing officer. During this portion of the hearing, advisors may confer privately and in a non-disruptive manner with their advisee, but they are not allowed to make opening statements or otherwise address the hearing officer or anyone else present at the hearing.\n\n(ii) After the hearing officer has asked their initial questions of the parties, the hearing officer will permit each party’s advisor to ask the other party all relevant questions and follow-up questions, including those challenging credibility. Subject to the discretion of the hearing officer, questioning of witnesses will generally follow a similar process, whereby the hearing officer will pose relevant questions to each witness, then the parties’ advisors will be permitted to ask relevant questions of witnesses. In accordance with the 2020 Title IX regulations, such cross-examination by advisors will be conducted orally, and in real time by the party’s advisor of choice and never by a party personally.\n\n(iii) Only relevant cross-examination and other questions may be asked of a party or witness. Before a complainant, respondent, or witness answers a cross-examination or other question, the hearing officer will first determine whether the question is relevant and explain any decision to exclude a question as not relevant. Advisors are not permitted to object to hearing officer decisions regarding relevance during a hearing.\n\n(iv) The evidence gathered throughout the investigation will be made available at the hearing, and each party and/or their advisor (as applicable) will have an equal opportunity to refer to such evidence during the hearing, including for purposes of cross-examination.\n\n(v) At the discretion of the hearing officer, parties (but not their advisors) will usually be given an opportunity to make a closing statement at the conclusion of the hearing.\n\nC) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Evidence</span>\n\n(i) Questions and evidence about the complainant’s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant and will not be permitted, except for the limited circumstance where such questions and evidence about the complainant’s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the respondent committed the conduct alleged by the complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the complainant’s prior sexual behavior with respect to the respondent and are offered to prove consent.\n\n(ii) Information protected under a legally recognized privilege (such as, for example, privileged communications between a party and their physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in a treatment capacity, or privileged communications between a party and their attorney), are not relevant unless the person holding the privilege has waived the privilege in writing and the hearing officer determines it is relevant.\n\n(iii) If a party or witness does not submit to cross-examination at the live hearing, the hearing officer will not rely on any statement of that party or witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility; provided, however, that the hearing officer will not draw an inference about the determination regarding responsibility based solely on a party’s or witness’s absence from the live hearing or refusal to answer cross-examination or other questions.\n\n## G. Record of Hearings\n\nMiddlebury will create an audio or audiovisual recording, or transcript, of any live hearing and make it available to the parties for inspection and review.\n\n## H. Determinations Regarding Responsibility\n\nWithin a reasonable time, the hearing officer (and if necessary the sanctioning authority, as provided below) will prepare and issue a written determination regarding responsibility and a recommendation on sanctions. In determining responsibility, the hearing officer will apply the preponderance of the evidence standard. The written determination will include:\n\n- Identification of the section(s) of Middlebury’s Non-Discrimination Policy alleged to have been violated\n- A description of the procedural steps taken from the receipt of the complaint through the determination, including but not limited to, as applicable, any notifications to the parties, interviews with parties and witnesses, site visits, methods used to gather other evidence, and hearings held\n- Findings of fact supporting the determination\n- Conclusions regarding the application of definitions of Title IX Sexual Harassment in Middlebury’s Non-Discrimination Policy to the facts;\n- A statement of, and rationale for, the result as to each allegation, including a determination regarding responsibility; and\n- Identification of Middlebury’s procedures and permissible bases for the Complainant and Respondent to appeal (as outlined below).\n\nThe determination regarding responsibility becomes final either on the date that Middlebury provides the parties with the written determination of the appeal, if an appeal is filed, or if an appeal is not filed, the date on which the appeal would no longer be considered timely.\n\nIf sanctions are necessary, they will be assigned in accordance with the Sanctions section below. The parties will receive notice simultaneously of the written determination and, if necessary, any sanctions as determined through the procedures outlined below.\n\n## VI. Sanctioning\n\n1\\. If the hearing officer finds that the respondent engaged in behavior that violates Middlebury policy, the CRTIX Coordinator will, in accordance with this Procedure, forward the case to the appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue (“sanctioning authority”), who will assign a sanction or sanctions, and other actions as appropriate. The hearing officer and the sanctioning authority will collaborate on the creation of a single written determination that will include the hearing officer’s statement and rationale regarding responsibility as described in more detail above, a statement of and rationale for any disciplinary action Middlebury is imposing on the respondent, and whether remedies designed to restore or preserve equal access to the educational program or activity of Middlebury will be provided by Middlebury to the complainant.\n\nIn determining the sanction or sanctions and/or other actions, the sanctioning authority will be guided by a number of considerations, including but not limited to the following:\n\n- The severity, pervasiveness and/or objective offensiveness of the behavior;\n- The nature of the Title IX Sexual Harassment;\n- The impact of the Title IX Sexual Harassment on the complainant;\n- The impact or implications of the Title IX Sexual Harassment within the Middlebury community;\n- Any prior misconduct by the respondent, including the respondent’s relevant prior conduct history, at Middlebury or elsewhere;\n- Whether the respondent has accepted responsibility for the Title IX Sexual Harassment;\n- The maintenance of a safe, nondiscriminatory and respectful environment conducive to living, learning, and/or working, as applicable; and\n- Any other mitigating, aggravating, or compelling factors.\n\nWhen a student respondent is found responsible for sexual assault, suspension or expulsion are the likely outcomes.\n\n2\\. Sanctions and other actions will go into effect at either the expiration of the deadline for the submission of an appeal where no appeal is submitted, or at the conclusion of the appeal process if applicable. This language does not preclude the possibility of emergency action as needed; please see Section II.D, Emergency Removals and Non-Student Administrative Leave.\n\n3\\. If the hearing officer finds conduct that violates the Non-Discrimination Policy (or other Middlebury policies under investigation), the CRTIX Coordinator will provide the case materials to the appropriate supervisory authority or authorities (e.g., for students: the Vice President for Student Affairs at the College,  the Dean of the Language Schools, the Dean of Enrollment, Advising and Student Services at the Institute, the Dean of the Bread Loaf School of English, etc.; for staff, that staff member’s supervisor, and for faculty, the Provost). When multiple supervisory authorities are involved in assigning sanctions, they may collaborate with each other as appropriate.\n\nAfter a review of the case materials and the hearing officer’s recommendation regarding sanctions, the supervisory authority may impose disciplinary sanctions.  Sanctioning and appeals for faculty whose primary appointment is in the undergraduate college will follow the procedures for Middlebury College faculty, regardless of the program for which the individual was employed at the time of the incident.\n\nSanctions for Prohibited Conduct could include written reprimands, probationary status, letters of official discipline, and/or suspension, expulsion, reassignment of duties, referral to other disciplinary processes, or termination from employment from any or all Middlebury program(s). Students should note that although sanctions for violation(s) of this policy can include any form of discipline as stated in this section, those found to have committed sexual assault will most likely receive a sanction of suspension or expulsion.  Middlebury may also take other non-disciplinary action as deemed appropriate under the circumstances (e.g., remedies applied to the respondent to address the needs of the complainant, including but not limited to room changes, class changes, building restrictions, extracurricular activity restrictions, modification of No Contact Orders to favor the complainant, and other actions designed to restore or preserve the complainant’s equal access to Middlebury’s educational program or activity). Middlebury may also provide notice of the matter to the appropriate supervisory authority of any Middlebury program in which the respondent intends to participate, who may consider this information in determining the respondent's admission to the program and/or other program participation parameters, as appropriate. Notification of a finding of responsibility, sanction, or other action under this policy may also be provided to the home institution of non-Middlebury undergraduate and graduate students or any other program in which the student is enrolled or to which the student is pursuing enrollment.\n\n4\\. If the hearing officer finds that a **faculty member** has engaged in conduct that violates this policy, or other Middlebury policies under investigation, if applicable (absent or following an appeal of that finding in accordance with paragraph G3, above, if an appeal was granted), the CRTIX Coordinator and/or HRO will provide the case materials to the appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue (e.g., the Middlebury College VPAA/Dean of Faculty, VPAA/Dean of the Institute, Vice President of the Language Schools, Dean of International Programs or Executive Vice President/Provost). The supervisory authority will refer the matter for separate procedures that may result in the imposition of appropriate disciplinary action according to the procedures in existing Faculty Handbook policies and/or contracts, as applicable. Disciplinary sanctions under this policy may therefore include written reprimands, salary freeze, termination of employment, reassignment or restriction of duties, and/or referral to separate procedures that govern employment status issues.\n\n5\\. In any case in which a finding of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking or related retaliation has been issued, violation of a plan or directive to address the prohibited conduct or related sanction may be grounds for further discipline.\n\n## VII. Appeals\n\nEither party may file an appeal from: 1) a determination regarding responsibility; and/or 2) the CRTIX Coordinator’s dismissal of a formal complaint or any allegations therein from the Title IX Sexual Harassment process, solely on the basis of one or more of the following circumstances:\n\n- Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;\n- New evidence that could  affect the outcome of the matter and that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility or dismissal was made has become available; and/or\n- The CRTIX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision-maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally, or the individual complainant or respondent, that affected the outcome of the matter.\n\nRegardless of which party appeals, both parties may participate in the appeals process. Middlebury will provide written notification to the complainant and the respondent of any applicable appeal procedures at the time they receive the written determination regarding responsibility and any sanctions.\n\nAn appeal must be made in writing to the appropriate appellate officer, which are:\n\n1\\. Students:\n\na. Undergraduate College students (including non-Middlebury students enrolled in Middlebury summer undergraduate courses): **VPAA/Dean of Faculty or designee**\n\nb. Middlebury Institute students: **VPAA/Dean of the Institute or designee**\n\nc. All other students in any other program:  **Executive Vice President/Provost or designee**\n\n2\\. Staff: **VP of HR**  \n3\\. Faculty: **Executive Vice President/Provost or designee**\n\nAn appeal must articulate one of the three bases above and provide information to support the appealing party’s argument. Appeals must be filed no later than 5 business days after the date on which Middlebury transmitted the hearing officer’s written determination to the parties. The CRTIX Coordinator or appellate officer may extend this deadline if warranted by the circumstances. Middlebury reserves the right to assign an alternate appellate officer to avoid a conflict of interest or bias.  The appellate officer will not be the same person as the hearing officer, the investigator, the CRTIX Coordinator, or a person who made a decision to dismiss a formal complaint.\n\nMiddlebury will notify the other party in writing when an appeal is filed and implement appeal procedures equally for both parties. The other party may then have a period of 5 business days to submit a statement in support of the written determination and/or in opposition to the appeal. Any such statement will be shared with the party who filed the appeal and their advisor.\n\nThe appellate officer will issue a written decision describing the result of the appeal and the rationale for the result; and Middlebury will provide the written decision simultaneously to both parties. The appellate officer’s decision on any appeal is the final step in the adjudication process, unless the appellate officer provides otherwise as discussed below.\n\nThe appellate officer may uphold the determination by the sanctioning authority, or modify the determination by the sanctioning authority or return the case to the original hearing officer (or an alternate, if warranted) in the event that the appellate officer concludes that either (1) a procedural irregularity affected the outcome of the matter;  (2) new evidence that could affect the outcome, and which was not available at the time of the determination, has become available; or (3) a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or the individual complainant or respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the appellate officer to determine which if any aspects of the case merit a new review, and to direct the CRTIX Coordinator accordingly.\n\nAbsent extenuating circumstances, the appellate officer will notify the complainant and respondent of the appeal decision simultaneously in writing within twenty business days of the appeal receipt deadline and will notify the CRTIX Coordinator in writing of any instructions for further action. This deadline may be extended if warranted by the circumstances. If this deadline is extended, the parties will be notified in writing at the time the extension is determined.\n\nThe decision to uphold or modify the determination by the appellate officer is final. If a case is returned for an additional hearing, the subsequent determination and/or sanction from that hearing are ordinarily final.\n\n**Pending Discipline (Students)**\n\nA student respondent will not be permitted to graduate from or otherwise be deemed to have officially completed a program in which they are enrolled while a disciplinary matter is pending; the student’s graduation or certification will be held in abeyance until the matter is resolved. If a respondent withdraws with a disciplinary matter, sanction, or appeal pending, the withdrawal will be considered a resignation from Middlebury, and the student will have given up the opportunity to return to Middlebury. The student’s official status at Middlebury will reflect the point in the process at which they withdrew, and the nature of the finding and sanction, as appropriate. Examples include but are not limited to \"Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Matter Pending,\" \"Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Sanction Pending,\" and \"Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Appeal Pending.\"\n\nIn extraordinary circumstances, the appropriate supervisory authority may, after appropriate consultation, a review of the case, and consideration of Middlebury’s best interests, grant permission for a respondent to withdraw from Middlebury when a disciplinary matter is pending. If the student is readmitted to Middlebury, the disciplinary matter must be resolved either before the student's return, or immediately upon the student's return (as determined by Middlebury).\n\n## VIII. Admission of Responsibility\n\nIf at any point a respondent chooses to accept responsibility for violating all policies under investigation, an official designated by the CRTIX Coordinator will issue a determination and refer the matter to the appropriate supervisory authority or authorities for the program at issue in accordance with this Procedure. The appropriate supervisory authority or authorities will issue a sanction and/or take other action that is designed to restore or preserve the complainant’s equal access to Middlebury’s education program or activity.\n\n## IX. Informal Resolution\n\n## A. General Information\n\nInformal resolution is a voluntary option that does not involve a hearing process. Informal resolution may be used in Title IX Sexual Harassment matters in which a formal complaint has been filed by a complainant or signed by the CRTIX Coordinator.\n\nThe CRTIX Coordinator will assess the request for informal resolution in light of factors such as, but not limited to, the severity of the alleged violation and the potential risks to campus community members posed by the reported misconduct. Middlebury will only proceed with an informal resolution process if both parties provide their voluntary, written consent to initiate the informal resolution process. Middlebury will not offer or facilitate an informal resolution process in matters that involve allegations that an employee committed Title IX Sexual Harassment against a student.\n\nAt any time prior to reaching a determination regarding responsibility, Middlebury may facilitate an informal resolution process (e.g., mediation or restorative justice) where requested by one party and agreed to by the other party. If a party requests the initiation of an informal resolution process and the CRTIX Coordinator agrees that the matter is appropriate for informal resolution, Middlebury will provide to each party a written notice that discloses:\n\n- The allegations;\n- The requirements of the informal resolution process, including the circumstances under which it precludes the parties from resuming a formal complaint arising from the same allegations-\n\n  - As noted below, Middlebury generally permits parties to withdraw from the informal resolution process and initiate or re-initiate a formal investigation and hearing process at any time before the informal resolution process is completed and any informal resolution is agreed to in writing by the parties); and\n\n- Any consequences resulting from participating in the informal resolution process, including the records that will be maintained or could be shared.\n\nThe matter will be deemed resolved if and when the parties expressly agree in writing to an outcome that is acceptable to them and which is approved by the CRTIX Coordinator (in consultation with other Middlebury administrators as deemed necessary).  A party may withdraw from the informal resolution process at any time prior to their execution of a written informal resolution agreement. After an informal resolution is agreed to in writing between the parties, neither party may initiate a formal resolution process regarding substantially the same factual allegations.\n\nAt any time before a matter is resolved through informal resolution, the CRTIX Coordinator may terminate an informal resolution process and initiate or re-initiate a formal investigation and hearing process at any time, as they deem appropriate in their discretion.\n\n## X. Training of Individuals Conducting Investigations and Adjudications and Facilitating Informal Resolution Processes \n\nThe CRTIX Coordinator, investigators, decision-makers, sanctioning authorities, appellate authorities, and individuals facilitating informal resolution processes (collectively, “Middlebury Officials”) receive training on the definition of Title IX Sexual Harassment in this policy, the scope of Middlebury’s education programs or activities, how to serve impartially (including by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at issue, conflicts of interest, and bias), and on issues of relevance of evidence as well as questions, including when questions and evidence about the complainant’s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant. Any materials used to train Middlebury Officials will not rely on sex stereotypes and will promote impartial adjudications of formal complaints. Middlebury will ensure that all Middlebury Officials comply with the standards on serving impartially that are outlined in this paragraph.\n\n## XI. Record Keeping \n\nThe HROs and the CRTIX Coordinator will maintain as required by the May 2020 Title IX regulations any records related to Title IX Title IX Sexual Harassment cases, and will keep confidential records and/or reports under this policy and the actions taken in response to those reports.\n\n## APPENDIX A\n\n## A. DEFINITIONS\n\n**1.** **Complainant**\n\nA complainant is an individual who is reported to have experienced conduct that could constitute Prohibited Conduct, regardless of whether the individual makes a report or seeks disciplinary action\n\n**2\\.** **Respondent**\n\nA respondent is an individual who has been reported to have engaged in conduct that could constitute Prohibited Conduct and whose alleged conduct is being investigated to determine if it is in violation of Middlebury’s policies.\n\n**3\\.** **Report**\n\nA Report is any information received by Middlebury College that a complainant has allegedly been subjected to conduct  which could constitute Title IX Sexual Harassment.  A Report is not a Formal Complaint and does not trigger a formal investigation or adjudication. Instead, reports serve as a basis for statistical reporting under the Jeanne Clery Act, and allow Middlebury to provide Supportive Measures to those who have experienced Title IX Sexual Harassment. Any Complainant who reports Title IX Sexual Harassment will receive information about the Formal Complaint and Investigation Process.\n\n**4\\.** **Formal Complaint**\n\nFormal complaint means a document filed by a complainant or signed by the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator alleging Title IX Sexual Harassment against a respondent and requesting that the recipient investigate the allegation of Title IX Sexual Harassment. At the time of filing a formal complaint, a complainant must be participating in or attempting to participate in the education program or activity of the recipient with which the formal complaint is filed. A formal complaint may be filed with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, or by electronic mail, by using the contact information required to be listed for the Title IX Coordinator under § 106.8(a), and by any additional method designated by the recipient.\n\n**5\\.** **Human Relations Officer**\n\nA Human Relations Officer (“HRO”) is an administrator responsible for overseeing investigations and adjudicating complaints under this Procedure. HROs are also the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator’s designees responsible for overseeing investigations and adjudicating sexual misconduct complaints in accordance with this Procedure.\n\n**6\\.** **Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator**\n\nThe Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator (\"CRTIX Coordinator\") is the administrator designated and authorized to coordinate Middlebury’s efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Title IX. The CRTIX Coordinator’s responsibilities include overseeing the process for handling and responding to all complaints of possible sex discrimination and identifying and addressing any patterns or systemic problems that arise during the review of such complaints.\n\nMiddlebury’s CRTIX Coordinator also participates in Middlebury’s handling and responding to complaints of sexual misconduct, domestic and dating violence and misconduct, and stalking, as defined in this policy.\n\nReferences throughout this Procedure to the CRTIX should be read as including individuals to whom the CRTIX has designated certain duties either in general or in the context of a particular case or situation.\n\n**7\\.** **Days**\n\nUnless otherwise noted, “days” indicates calendar days, regardless of whether the majority of Middlebury’s administrative offices are open. “Business days” indicates days on which the majority of Middlebury’s administrative offices are open, and generally connotes Mondays through Fridays. In computing any period of time referenced in this Procedure, the day of the act or event (e.g., provision of evidence for review and response, issuance of a determination or sanction) from which the designated time period begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included if it is a business day; when not a business day, the period will conclude at the end of the next business day.\n\n**8\\.** **Parties**\n\nOnly the complainant and respondent are considered a “party” or “parties” as that term is used within this policy.\n\nPublished: August 14, 2020\n\n---\n\n<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" id=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> Note that Schools Abroad are covered under AHD\n\n<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\" id=\"_ftn2\">[2]</a> Middlebury’s Vermont undergraduate campus program includes a confidential resource called MiddSafe; for more information, see [https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/health-wellness-education-and-saf...](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/health-wellness-education-and-safety/education/middsafe).\n","excerpt":"I.

What This Procedure Covers</h2>\n<p>This Title IX Formal Grievance Procedure (“Procedure”) applies to instances of Sexual Harassment <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">(</span>as defined by May 2020 U.S. Department of Education Title IX regulation) which occur on or after August 14, 2020.  All references to Sexual Harassment within this Procedure are intended to apply to and comply with the definition of Sexual Harassment as defined by Department of Education in its Title IX regulation.</p>\n<p>Middlebury may, in exceptional circumstances, vary from this Procedure.  So long as such a variation is consistent with Title IX regulations and allows for fundamental fairness in the processes followed, variations from this process under those circumstances will not invalidate an outcome.</p>\n<p>Except as otherwise specified herein, this Procedure applies to faculty, staff and students, as well as to others who participate or attempt to participate in Middlebury’s programs and activities.  This includes the undergraduate college, the Language Schools, the School of the Environment, MiddCore, Bread Loaf School of English, Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference, and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey (\"the Institute\").<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" id=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>  Faculty and staff are, together, referred to as “Employee” or “Employees” in this Procedure.</p>\n<p>This Procedure applies to Sexual Harassment as defined by the Department of Education and as set forth in the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy\" title=\"Non-discrimination\">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> so long as the following conditions are met:</p>\n<p>(i) The alleged conduct was perpetrated against a person in the United States; and</p>\n<p>(ii) The alleged conduct took place within Middlebury’s programs and activities, meaning that the conduct occurred in a location, at an event, or in a circumstance where Middlebury exercises substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the conduct occurs, or in any building owned or controlled by a student organization recognized by Middlebury; <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">and</span>, the Complainant is participating in or attempting to participate in Middlebury’s programs or activities.</p>\n<p>Conduct that occurs off campus in locations or at events without direction or control by Middlebury does not meet the definition of occurring in “a program or activity of Middlebury”.  Such conduct may be prohibited under other Middlebury policies, including the Non-Discrimination Policy provisions addressing forms of discrimination other than Title IX Sexual Harassment, and is addressed using different procedures.  Only behavior meeting the definitional requirements of this section will be addressed utilizing this Procedure.  Where a complaint alleges other Middlebury policy violations arising out of the same facts and circumstances as allegations that must be addressed utilizing this Procedure, Middlebury may, in its discretion, address those other alleged violations through this Procedure.</p>\n<p>Conduct that occurred prior to August 14, 2020 will be investigated and adjudicated consistent with the procedures detailed in the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook_old/smdvs\" title=\"SMDVS\">SMDVS Policy</a> and/or the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin\" title=\"AHD\">Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy</a> in effect during Academic Year 2019-2020, prior to the August 14, 2020 effective date of the Department of Education’s May 2020 regulations.  However, informal or “adaptable” resolutions may be available to address concerns about alleged conduct under the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy\" title=\"Non-discrimination\">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> regardless of the date it occurred.</p>\n<h2>II. Reporting Title IX Sexual Harassment</h2>\n<p><strong>In order to fulfill its commitment to fostering a safe and inclusive learning environment, Middlebury values reporting of all types of sexual harassment, which includes sexual assault.</strong> Any person who believes that they have been subject to Title IX Sexual Harassment, or who has reason to believe that Title IX Sexual Harassment has occurred or is occurring, should report this information to the immediate attention of the Civil Rights and Title IX (“CRTIX”) Coordinator.  The CRTIX Coordinator is:</p>\n<p>Marti McCaleb<br>\nCivil Rights and Title IX Coordinator<br>\nMiddlebury College<br>\n213 Service Building<br>\n84 S Service Rd<br>\nMiddlebury, VT 05753<br>\n(802) 443-2147<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:mmccaleb@middlebury.edu\">mmccaleb@middlebury.edu</a></p>\n<p>A report or complaint may be made verbally (in person, by phone, or videoconferencing) during applicable business hours, or in writing (via mail or email) 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. You may also report using the online reporting tool at go/report. Please note that while a report may be made anonymously, this will limit Middlebury’s ability to take action to provide supportive measures or to address the situation.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Which Middlebury Employees Must Report Sexual Harassment?</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>With the exception of certain persons designated as “Confidential Resources,” as described below, all Middlebury employees must report any incident that could constitute Sexual Harassment involving a Middlebury student, employee or other covered person, to the CRTIX Coordinator and/or an HRO</strong>. The report should include relevant details about the incident of which they are aware, including the names of the parties, any witnesses, and any other relevant facts, including the date, time, and specific location of the alleged incident. To the extent possible, information reported will be shared with others only to the extent necessary to respond to the situation and support the parties and in accordance with state and federal law. Examples include individuals who are responsible for processing, investigating, adjudicating, and responding to sexual misconduct, domestic and dating violence and  misconduct, stalking and/or related retaliation reports; deans; program directors; supervisors; Human Resources staff; and Department of Public Safety or other campus security personnel who are responsible for reporting campus crime statistics and issuing timely warnings under the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act.</p>\n<h2>A. Who Are Confidential Resources?</h2>\n<p>Confidential Resources include the staff of the Parton Center for Health and Wellness, the staff of the Chaplain’s office, Middlebury Safe and Confidential Advocates (“MiddSafe”)<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" id=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a> or other medical, counseling, support or religious personnel and volunteers who are required by law to maintain confidentiality.</p>\n<p>Middlebury encourages individuals to use confidential services.  Individuals who seek those services should understand that confidentiality is not absolute and that those resources may have ethical or legal obligations to report certain information to others.  As one example, Confidential Resources are typically obligated under state law to report instances of child abuse.</p>\n<h2>B. Participation and Cooperation</h2>\n<p>All members of Middlebury’s community covered by the Non-Discrimination Policy and identified in connection with an investigation under this Procedure are expected to cooperate and provide complete, accurate, and truthful information. Middlebury prohibits intentionally making a false report or providing false or misleading information in any investigation under this Procedure. Complainants will not be deemed to have provided false or misleading information under this Procedure if their factual allegations are intended to be truthful and are made in good faith, regardless of whether the conduct complained of is ultimately found to constitute a policy violation.</p>\n<p>Witnesses may be expected to sign statements or other documents memorializing the information provided in the course of the investigation and may be asked to keep the substance of the investigation interview confidential.</p>\n<h2>C. Supportive Measures (Previously called “Interim Measures”)</h2>\n<p><em>Supportive measures</em> are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to the complainant or the respondent before or after the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been filed. Such measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity without unreasonably burdening the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the recipient’s educational environment, or deter sexual harassment. Supportive measures may include but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>counseling;</li>\n<li>academic accommodations, such as extensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments, course changes or late drops, or other arrangements as appropriate (see the Academics: Course Registration and Conduct of Courses and Grades and Transcripts sections of the Handbook for more information);</li>\n<li>modifications of work or class schedules;</li>\n<li>campus escort services;</li>\n<li>mutual restrictions on contact between the parties;</li>\n<li>Residential accommodations, including but not limited to arranging for new housing, or providing temporary housing options, as appropriate;</li>\n<li>changes in work locations;</li>\n<li>leaves of absence;</li>\n<li>increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus;</li>\n<li>Changing transportation or working arrangements or providing other employment accommodations, as appropriate;</li>\n<li>Assisting the individual in accessing support services, including, as available, victim advocacy, academic support, counseling, disability, health or mental health services, visa and immigration assistance, student financial aid services, and legal assistance both on and off campus, as applicable (see Appendix C for a list of resources);</li>\n<li>No Trespass Notices prohibiting the presence of an individual on Middlebury property, and/or other properties on which Middlebury programs are occurring;</li>\n<li>Informing the individual of the right to report a crime to local law enforcement and/or seek orders of protection, restraining orders, or relief from abuse orders from United States courts or courts outside of the United States as applicable, and providing assistance if the individual wishes to do so. Middlebury will also work with complainants and others as appropriate to respect and implement the requirements of such orders on premises that it owns or controls, as necessary and appropriate;</li>\n<li>and other similar measures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is not necessary to file a complaint with Middlebury, participate in an adjudication process, or file a criminal complaint in order to request supportive measures from Middlebury.</p>\n<p>Where a complainant reportedly subjected to Sexual Harassment makes a request for supportive measures like those described above, Middlebury will consider the request and provide those Supportive measures which are reasonably available and reasonably allow for the preservation or restoration of access to or participation in Middlebury programs.</p>\n<p>Students or employees seeking supportive measures <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"></span> should direct their request to the CRTIX Coordinator, HROs, Human Resources, dean, or program director, as appropriate. The request will be evaluated and responded to by the CRTIX Coordinator or designee (e.g. HRO<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">s</span>, Commons dean, or program director) after consultation, as needed, with the appropriate authority or authorities for the school or program at issue. The CRTIX Coordinator is ultimately responsible for coordinating the effective implementation of supportive measures. Factors to be considered in determining whether to provide certain supportive measures may include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the specific need expressed by the party;</li>\n<li>the severity and/or pervasiveness of the allegations;</li>\n<li>any continuing effects on the party;</li>\n<li>whether the parties share the same residence hall, dining hall, class, extracurricular activities, transportation and/or job location;</li>\n<li>whether other judicial measures have been taken to protect a party or the parties; and.</li>\n<li>whether other measures are reasonably available to support the individual.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Middlebury will maintain as confidential any supportive measures provided to a party, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the ability of Middlebury to provide the supportive measures. As such, Middlebury may need to disclose some information about the individual to a third party to provide the supportive measures in a timely manner. The following individuals are typically responsible for determining what information should be disclosed and to whom it should be disclosed: CRTIX Coordinator, an HRO, dean, Public Safety officer or program director. The decision to disclose information will be made after careful consideration of possible alternatives to disclosure and/or limiting the information provided to the third party as much as possible without compromising Middlebury’s ability to provide the supportive measures.</p>\n<h2>D. Emergency Removal and Administrative Leave</h2>\n<p>Nothing in this Procedure limits Middlebury’s rights to terminate or suspend the employment of any staff or faculty member under otherwise-applicable Middlebury policies, practices, contracts, or procedures.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">1. Emergency Removal&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Where there is an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment, Middlebury can remove a respondent from its education program or activity (which may include removing an employee respondent from their employment at Middlebury) and issue any necessary related no-trespass and no-contact orders.  Middlebury will make the decision to remove a respondent from its education program or activity based on an individualized assessment and risk analysis. If Middlebury makes such a decision, the respondent will be provided with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following the removal.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">2. Administrative Leave for Employees&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Middlebury may place employee respondents (non-students) on paid administrative leave during the pendency of an investigation and resolution process as outlined below. Middlebury reserves the right to place an employee respondent (non-student) on unpaid administrative leave during the pendency of an investigation and resolution process. In those instances in which Middlebury determines that an administrative leave will be unpaid and the respondent was not offered the opportunity to challenge the suspension without pay before it was imposed through some other process, the respondent may present a written challenge regarding the need for or the adequacy of the unpaid administrative leave to the CRTIX Coordinator. Once a written challenge of unpaid administrative leave is received, the CRTIX Coordinator will involve the relevant Middlebury leadership, which may include Human Resources and/or department leaders, and schedule a virtual or in-person meeting with the respondent prior to making a determination.</p>\n<h2>E. Options to Pursue Criminal or Legal Actions (Reporting Outside of Middlebury)</h2>\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">1. Criminal Complaints</h3>\n<p>Any student or employee may pursue criminal charges with local, state, or federal law enforcement agencies. Middlebury will offer and, upon request, provide assistance to individuals covered under this procedure with notifying law enforcement agencies. These options are available regardless of whether an individual chooses to file a complaint with Middlebury. Individuals have the option to notify such agencies with or without assistance from Middlebury, and have the option not to personally notify such authorities.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">2. Orders of Protection</h3>\n<p>Middlebury does not have the authority to issue Relief From Abuse Orders, Orders of Protection or Restraining Orders as these are granted by the court system. Individuals who have experienced Title IX Sexual Harassment may be eligible to pursue Orders of Protection, Restraining Orders and/or Relief from Abuse Orders from courts in the United States or courts outside of the United States as applicable. Middlebury will offer its support to individuals if they request Middlebury’s assistance with making contact with law enforcement authorities and other external resources to seek such orders. Middlebury will respect such orders to the extent applicable.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">3. Assistance by Middlebury</h3>\n<p>Requests for assistance with contacting law enforcement authorities or obtaining an Order of Protection, a Relief from Abuse Order, a Restraining Order or other lawful order may be made in person, via email, phone or teleconference to the CRTIX Coordinator, an HRO, or Public Safety For additional information regarding making reports to the police and/or obtaining an Order of Protection, Restraining Order, or Relief from Abuse Order.</p>\n<h2>III. FORMAL COMPLAINTS/GRIEVANCES &#x26; PRE-INVESTIGATION</h2>\n<p>In addition to the reporting options and access to supportive measures addressed above, a complainant may file a formal written complaint alleging Title IX Sexual Harassment against a respondent and requesting that Middlebury investigate the allegation. At the time of filing a formal complaint, a complainant must be participating in or attempting to participate in Middlebury’s programs or activities. A formal complaint may be filed with the CRTIX Coordinator in person, by mail, or by electronic mail, by using the contact information contained in Section II, above.</p>\n<h2>A. Pre-Investigation: Determinations of Applicable Procedures, Dismissals, Transfers and Appeals of Such Determinations</h2>\n<p>1. Middlebury will investigate alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment where a complainant submits a signed or electronically submitted formal complaint to the CRTIX coordinator, requests an investigation, and the signed written complaint meets the requirements of this section. In cases where the complainant does not wish to submit a formal complaint but the CRTIX Coordinator decides in their discretion to sign a complaint and initiate an investigation and resolution process, the CRTIX Coordinator will not be a complainant or otherwise a party to the matter.  Middlebury will terminate the Title IX Sexual Harassment Investigation if a complainant notifies the CRTIX Coordinator in writing that the complainant would like to withdraw the formal complaint.</p>\n<p>2. When a complainant requests an investigation,</p>\n<p>(a) the CRTIX Coordinator will, promptly upon receipt of a report, determine whether:</p>\n<p>i) the conduct alleged would, if proved, constitute Title IX Sexual Harassment (i.e., <em>Quid Pro Quo</em> Sexual Harassment, Severe, Pervasive and Objectively Offensive Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, or sex-based Domestic Violence, Dating Violence or Stalking) as defined in the Non-Discrimination Policy as Title IX Sexual Harassment;</p>\n<p>ii) the conduct allegedly occurred in Middlebury’s education program or activity; and</p>\n<p>iii)  the conduct allegedly occurred in the United States.</p>\n<p>(b) the CRTIX Coordinator/HRO or designee may gather additional information as appropriate before making the determinations required by part (a) of this subsection. During any such initial inquiry, all individuals are expected to cooperate.</p>\n<p>3. If some but not all of the conduct alleged in the complaint satisfies all 3 of these elements and a formal complaint is received from a complainant or signed by the CRTIX Coordinator, Middlebury may choose to address the entire matter through this Title IX Sexual Harassment Procedure (that is, it will as required by federal regulations follow Title IX Sexual Harassment procedures to address the alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment, and it may, to promote efficiency or for other compelling reasons, choose to follow this Title IX Sexual Harassment Procedure to address other prohibited conduct in such mixed cases, so that all related misconduct may be addressed through one investigation and resolution process).</p>\n<p>4. If it appears based upon initial review or upon information gathered during an investigation that the matter does not satisfy and/or no longer satisfies all 3 of these elements, Middlebury will, as required by Title IX regulations, dismiss the matter from the Title IX Sexual Harassment Procedure, and will transfer it for handling under the Non-Discrimination Investigation and Resolutions Procedure or other Middlebury procedures, as deemed appropriate by Middlebury.</p>\n<p>5. Even if the allegations of a matter fall within the definition of Title IX Sexual Harassment, Middlebury may (but is not required to) dismiss a formal complaint or any allegations therein if at any time during the investigation or resolution process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the complainant would like to withdraw the formal complaint or any allegations therein;</li>\n<li>The respondent is no longer enrolled or employed by Middlebury; or</li>\n<li>Specific circumstances prevent Middlebury from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the formal complaint or allegations therein.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>6. If a formal complaint is dismissed by Middlebury under the circumstances described above, Middlebury will simultaneously provide to the parties written notice (by electronic or other means) of the dismissal and the reasons for the dismissal, and notice of the parties’ opportunity to appeal such dismissal through the Title IX Sexual Harassment appeal procedures outlined below.</p>\n<p>7. If the respondent is a Student and an Employee, the CRTIX Coordinator will determine which procedures apply based upon the facts and circumstances, such as whether the respondent’s status as a Student or an Employee predominates in the context of the Prohibited Conduct. If a Student-Employee is found to have engaged in Prohibited Conduct, the Student-Employee may be subject to sanctions both in connection with their employment and in connection with their student status, as appropriate under these and other applicable procedures.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Additional Policy Violations:</span></p>\n<p>1. If the CRTIX Coordinator/HRO becomes aware, at any point prior to or during the investigation and adjudication process, of additional allegations against the respondent that, if proven, could constitute violations of other non-academic policies, including harassment or discrimination investigated under Middlebury’s Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy, these allegations may, at Middlebury’s discretion, be investigated and adjudicated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.  In matters involving Employees, where the CRTIX Coordinator/HRO becomes aware of additional allegations of violations of Middlebury Policy, those concerns will be reported to the Employee’s appropriate supervisory authority (e.g., VPAA/dean of the Faculty, VPAA/dean of the Institute, VPAA/dean of the Language Schools, Executive Vice President/Provost), who, in consultation with Human Resources,  will consider whether and how to proceed under the relevant Faculty Handbook or Employee Handbook procedures and/or applicable contracts or policies.</p>\n<p>2. If one party alleges that another party violated a No Contact Order (NCO) or No Trespass Notice (NTN) and makes the allegations at a time when they can be evaluated during an ongoing Title IX Sexual Harassment investigation/adjudication or after the Title IX Sexual Harassment investigation/adjudication process has been completed, the HRO or HRO’s designee will determine how to proceed.</p>\n<p>3. If the HRO does not assume jurisdiction, the allegations may be addressed through Middlebury's conduct process for the appropriate school or program, or through the appropriate employment process. Alternatively, the HRO may designate an appropriate Middlebury official(s) to oversee and/or conduct an investigation and adjudicate the matter.  If a violation of a NCO or NTN is found, the matter will be referred to the appropriate supervisory authority for discipline and/or other appropriate action in accordance with existing handbook policies.</p>\n<p>4. If the HRO assumes jurisdiction over the allegations and deems an investigation to be necessary, the HRO will determine the scope, process, and timeline of the NCO/NTN investigation and adjudication, which may not necessarily follow the procedures outlined in this Title IX Investigation &#x26; Resolutions Procedure, if the HRO determines that using other procedures is more appropriate. The HRO has the discretion to determine whether an advisor of choice may be present at any processes or meetings related to an NCO/NTN investigation, depending on the circumstances. Both parties will have an opportunity to review and respond to all evidence relevant to the NCO/NTN investigation according to a timeline established by the HRO. The HRO will make a finding and will refer the matter to the appropriate sanctioning authority if a violation is found. Should the HRO determine that an NCO/NTN violation may also constitute retaliation, the parties will be notified in writing that retaliation will be added to the policies under consideration in the Title IX Sexual Harassment investigation or be part of a subsequent investigation, as applicable.</p>\n<p>5. In all cases the parties will receive written notification if the CRTIX Coordinator/HRO determines that additional possible policy violations will be investigated and adjudicated in accordance with the Title IX procedures set forth herein or through a different set of procedures.</p>\n<h2>B. Bias</h2>\n<p>If either party is concerned that an official involved in the investigation or adjudication (such as, for example, an investigator, CRTIX Coordinator, or HRO) may be biased or have a conflict of interest, the party should share their concerns immediately. Concerns of this nature about the investigator should be shared with the CRTIX Coordinator; concerns about the CRTIX Coordinator or an HRO should be shared with the Chief Diversity Officer. The official with whom the concern is shared will consider the concern and inform the parties of a decision as to whether any related action is appropriate and whether an alternate will be appointed. If an alternate investigator, HRO, or CRTIX Coordinator is appointed, the alternate shall have the same authority as the originally designated official.</p>\n<h2>C. Additional Procedures for Dismissed Complaints.</h2>\n<p>If the CRTIX Coordinator dismisses a complaint under subsections (A)(1) or (A)(6) of this Part III, the CRTIX must promptly:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>inform the parties that the dismissal is appealable in accordance with the appeal provisions described in this Procedure, below; and</li>\n<li>consider whether the conduct alleged, if proved, would constitute a violation of Middlebury policy that should be investigated and adjudicated in accordance with another Middlebury policy, and initiate applicable procedures accordingly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>IV. INVESTIGATIONS</h2>\n<h2>A. Investigations Procedure</h2>\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">1. General Investigation Provisions</h3>\n<p>As required by the 2020 Title IX regulations, in investigations conducted under this Procedure, the following provisions will apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The burden of proof and the burden of gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination regarding responsibility rest on Middlebury and not on the parties;</li>\n<li>Parties will have an equal opportunity to present witnesses, including fact and expert witnesses, and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence;</li>\n<li>Parties are not restricted in their ability to discuss the allegations under investigation or to gather and present relevant evidence; and</li>\n<li>When a party is invited or expected to attend a hearing, investigative interview, or other meeting, they will receive written notice of the date, time location, participants, and purpose of such a hearing, investigative interview or meeting, with sufficient time for the party to prepare to participate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">2. Initial Notice of Investigation</h3>\n<p>When Middlebury initiates an investigation under this Procedure it will provide to the parties a written notice (by electronic or other means) that includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information about Middlebury’s formal and informal resolution processes;</li>\n<li>A statement of the allegations of behavior potentially constituting Title IX Sexual Harassment, including sufficient details known at the time and with sufficient time to prepare a response before any initial post-intake interview. Sufficient details include the identities of the parties involved in the incident, if known, the conduct allegedly constituting Title IX Sexual Harassment, and the date and location of the alleged incident, if known;</li>\n<li>A statement that the respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct and that a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the grievance process;</li>\n<li>Information regarding Middlebury’s presumption of good faith reporting and a summary of false complaint information outlined below;</li>\n<li>Notification that the parties may have an advisor of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney; and</li>\n<li>Notification that the parties may inspect and review evidence during the investigation and resolution process, as provided below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If, in the course of an investigation, Middlebury decides to investigate allegations about any party that are not included in the notice described above, it will provide notice of the additional allegations to the parties whose identities are known.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">3. Consolidation of Formal Complaints</h3>\n<p>Middlebury may consolidate formal complaints of Title IX Sexual Harassment against more than one respondent, or by more than one complainant against one or more respondents, or by one party against the other party, where the allegations of such Title IX Sexual Harassment arise out of the same facts or circumstances. Where a grievance process involves more than one complainant or more than one respondent, references in this section to the singular “party,” “complainant,” or “respondent” include the plural, as applicable.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #660000;\">4. Disabilities</h3>\n<p>Students registered with the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/ada\">Disability Resource Center </a>can request accommodations to ensure their full and equal participation in any conduct process and/or proceeding. Accommodation requests may be made directly to the CRTIX Coordinator. Accommodations are determined on an individual basis in consultation with the ADA Coordinators. Employees with disabilities may contact Human Resources.</p>\n<h2>B. Conduct of the Investigation</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The CRTIX Coordinator will appoint an investigator. In selecting the investigator for a particular matter, the CRTIX Coordinator will take care to select an individual who does not have a conflict of interest or bias against complainants or respondents generally or an individual complainant or respondent. The CRTIX Coordinator will notify the parties of the identity of the investigator and parties may, within three calendar days of such notice, object to the appointment of the investigator by providing a written statement (which may be transmitted electronically) as to why the party believes that the investigator has a conflict of interest or bias. The CRTIX Coordinator will make decisions regarding such objections and the appointment of an alternate investigator, as necessary.</li>\n<li>The investigator is authorized to contact any and all individuals who may have relevant information. The nature and scope of the investigation is within the discretion of the investigator.  The investigator is authorized to access relevant records, except those legally protected as confidential or privileged, and may collect any additional evidence relevant to the complaint. Middlebury recognizes, however, that individuals who are bound by legal privileges may not be able to disclose privileged information, unless an exception applies. The investigator will not access, consider, disclose or otherwise use a party’s privileged records without the party’s voluntary, written consent to do so, and such information will not be deemed relevant to an investigation or adjudication absent the voluntary, written consent of the party.</li>\n<li>The complainant and respondent will be asked to identify, preserve and submit all evidence pertaining to the matter under investigation, and to identify witnesses they believe may have relevant testimony to share. The investigator is not required to consider particular evidence submitted or interview any particular witness, even if identified by one of the parties.</li>\n<li>All participants in the investigation are expected to provide complete, accurate, and truthful information.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>C. Preliminary Report</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>After the complainant and the respondent have had the opportunity to make their own statement and to identify witnesses and other potential information, and the investigator has completed witness interviews and the gathering of evidence, the investigator will prepare a preliminary report.</li>\n<li>Middlebury will provide each party with an equal opportunity to inspect and review any evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the allegations raised, including the evidence upon which Middlebury does not intend to rely in reaching a determination regarding responsibility and/or which the investigator does not deem relevant, and inculpatory or exculpatory evidence whether obtained from a party or other source, so that each party can meaningfully respond to the evidence prior to conclusion of the investigation. Such evidence will not include privileged records or information that may have been gathered or received during the investigation, absent written consent from the party holding the privilege.</li>\n<li>Middlebury will send to each party and the party’s advisor, if any, the evidence subject to inspection and review in an electronic format or a hard copy.</li>\n<li>Parties and advisors are not permitted to download, print or copy such evidence subject to inspection and review, and are not permitted to re-disclose such evidence without Middlebury’s permission. Parties and advisors will be required to sign an acknowledgment form indicating that they understand these prohibitions. Violations of these prohibitions may subject parties to Middlebury discipline under applicable conduct codes.</li>\n<li>The complainant and the respondent will have an opportunity to review the preliminary report within the same time period and provide written responses to the report.  The complainant and the respondent must submit any comments, feedback, additional documents, evidence, suggested questions for individuals interviewed, requests for additional investigation, names of additional witnesses, or any other information they deem relevant to the investigator, including additional documents or other evidence, within 10 calendar days after the preliminary report is sent to them for review.  The parties' written responses will be considered by the investigator prior to completion of the final investigative report, and some or all of the responses may be attached or otherwise incorporated into the final investigative report.</li>\n<li>In the event that new, relevant information is provided or identified at this stage, the information will be incorporated into the preliminary report as deemed appropriate by the investigator, and the complainant and the respondent will be provided a second opportunity  to review and provide a written response regarding the new information, which the investigator will consider prior to completion of the final investigation report.  Identification of new and relevant information after the parties’ review of the preliminary report is likely to extend the time frame of the investigation.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>D. Final Investigative Report </h2>\n<ol>\n<li>After considering any written response submitted by either party, or after the 10 calendar day comment period has lapsed without receiving a written response or responses, the investigator will address any relevant issues identified by the complainant and/or the respondent, and as appropriate, pursue any additional investigative steps as needed. The final investigative report will be reviewed for completeness by the CRTIX Coordinator or one HRO (not the hearing officer) before it is issued.</li>\n<li>The final investigative report created by the investigator will fairly summarize relevant evidence and include as exhibits evidentiary materials as deemed appropriate by the investigator;</li>\n<li>The final investigative report will include the investigator’s recommendation as to whether the respondent should be found responsible for violating the policy provisions at issue;</li>\n<li>At least 10 days prior to the hearing referenced below, Middlebury will send to each party and the party’s advisor, if any, the final investigative report and exhibits in an electronic format or a hard copy, for their review and written response; and</li>\n<li>The final investigative report and the parties’ written responses, if any, will be provided to the hearing officer in advance of the hearing.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>V. Hearings and Determinations of Responsibility</h2>\n<h2>A. In General</h2>\n<p>Live hearings will be provided as required by the 2020 Title IX regulations. At the request of either party, Middlebury will provide for the hearing to occur with the parties located in separate rooms with technology enabling the hearing officer and parties to simultaneously see and hear the party or the witness answering questions. Live hearings may be conducted with all parties physically present in the same location or, at Middlebury’s discretion, any or all parties, witnesses, and other participants may appear at the live hearing virtually, with technology enabling participants simultaneously to see and hear each other.</p>\n<h2>B. Hearing Officers</h2>\n<p>Hearings will be presided over by a hearing officer, who will make the decision by a preponderance of the evidence as to whether or not the respondent violated the policy provisions at issue. The hearing officer has broad authority to determine the process, timing and conduct of a hearing. For example, the hearing officer will determine the order of presentation, timing and overall duration of the hearing, what information and evidence will be heard, what information and questions are relevant to the determination of the matter, and what cross-examination questions will or will not be permitted.</p>\n<p>Hearing officers, ordinarily one of Middlebury’s HROs, will be appointed by the CRTIX Coordinator. In selecting a hearing officer for a particular matter, the CRTIX Coordinator will take care to select an individual who does not have a conflict of interest or bias against complainants or respondents generally or an individual complainant or respondent. Middlebury will notify the parties of the identity of the hearing officer in advance of the hearing, and parties may, within 3 calendar days of such notice, object to the service of the hearing officer by providing a written statement (which may be transmitted electronically) as to why the party believes that the hearing officer has a conflict of interest or bias. The CRTIX Coordinator or designee will make decisions regarding such objections and the appointment of an alternate hearing officer, as necessary.</p>\n<h2>C. Advisors</h2>\n<p>Each party may have an advisor of their choice present at a hearing for the limited purpose of conducting cross-examination on behalf of that party. Advisors are not required to be attorneys, but attorneys are permitted to serve as advisors. If a party does not have an advisor of their choice present at a hearing, Middlebury will without fee or charge to the party provide an advisor of Middlebury’s choice, for the limited purpose of conducting cross-examination on behalf of that party. No later than 10 calendar days before the hearing, parties should inform the CRTIX Coordinator of the identity of any advisor of choice who will accompany them to the hearing, so that Middlebury will know whether or not it needs to arrange for the presence of a Middlebury-provided advisor, even if the party declines to attend the hearing.</p>\n<p>At a time and manner deemed appropriate by the hearing officer, the advisor for each party will be permitted to ask the other party and any witnesses all relevant cross-examination questions and follow-up questions, including those challenging credibility. Advisors must comply with the conduct expectations for hearings. Except for the limited role of asking cross-examination questions, advisors may not participate actively in the hearing and may not speak or otherwise communicate on the part of the party that the advisor is advising. However, the advisor may consult privately in a non-disruptive manner with their advisee during and/or at a recess in the hearing. Scheduling accommodations generally will not be made for advisors if they unduly delay the process. Middlebury reserves the right to take appropriate action regarding any advisor who disrupts the process, or who does not abide by the restrictions on their participation as determined in the sole discretion of the hearing officer, which may include exclusion of the advisor from the hearing and the appointment of an alternate Middlebury-provided advisor.</p>\n<h2>D. Middlebury Faculty and Staff as Advisors </h2>\n<p>A Middlebury faculty or staff member who agrees to serve as an advisor to a complainant or respondent is not an agent of Middlebury when acting in that capacity and does not speak or act on Middlebury’s behalf while serving as an advisor.  The relationship between a party and their advisor for the TIX Sexual Harassment hearing is not confidential (or privileged), and the faculty or staff member’s duties to Middlebury—including all reporting obligations—remain intact.  Before agreeing to serve as an advisor, faculty and staff members should evaluate whether any conflict or potential conflict of interest may warrant their declining the invitation to serve as an advisor. In addition, only licensed attorneys can provide legal advice. Parties seeking legal advice should consult their attorney.</p>\n<h2>E. Requests for Appearance of Witnesses</h2>\n<p>If a Party wishes to have an individual appear at the hearing as a witness, they must provide notice of the identity of the proposed witness and a brief description of the subject matter of the witnesses’ testimony to the CRTIX Coordinator or designee at least 10 calendar days before the date of the hearing. The CRTIX Coordinator or designee, in consultation with the hearing officer as necessary, will determine whether the witness is likely to have information that is relevant to the hearing, and if it is determined that the witness is likely to have relevant information, the CRTIX Coordinator or designee will inform the witness that their presence at the hearing is expected. These provisions apply equally to both fact and expert witnesses.</p>\n<h2>F. Conduct of Hearings and Relevance</h2>\n<p>A) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Report to be provided to Hearing Officer</span></p>\n<p>At or before the hearing, the hearing officer will receive a copy of the investigative report, any attachments thereto, and copies of the parties’ written responses to the investigative report, if any, which will be part of the information of record to be considered by the hearing officer to the extent appropriate in light of the rules regarding evidence to be considered that are outlined below.</p>\n<p>B) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">General Order of the Hearing</span></p>\n<p>(i) Subject to the discretion of the hearing officer, hearings will ordinarily begin with introductory remarks by the hearing officer to explain the process, followed by a brief opening statement from any party who wishes to provide one, followed by the hearing officer’s asking relevant initial questions of the parties as deemed appropriate by the hearing officer. During this portion of the hearing, advisors may confer privately and in a non-disruptive manner with their advisee, but they are not allowed to make opening statements or otherwise address the hearing officer or anyone else present at the hearing.</p>\n<p>(ii) After the hearing officer has asked their initial questions of the parties, the hearing officer will permit each party’s advisor to ask the other party all relevant questions and follow-up questions, including those challenging credibility. Subject to the discretion of the hearing officer, questioning of witnesses will generally follow a similar process, whereby the hearing officer will pose relevant questions to each witness, then the parties’ advisors will be permitted to ask relevant questions of witnesses. In accordance with the 2020 Title IX regulations, such cross-examination by advisors will be conducted orally, and in real time by the party’s advisor of choice and never by a party personally.</p>\n<p>(iii) Only relevant cross-examination and other questions may be asked of a party or witness. Before a complainant, respondent, or witness answers a cross-examination or other question, the hearing officer will first determine whether the question is relevant and explain any decision to exclude a question as not relevant. Advisors are not permitted to object to hearing officer decisions regarding relevance during a hearing.</p>\n<p>(iv) The evidence gathered throughout the investigation will be made available at the hearing, and each party and/or their advisor (as applicable) will have an equal opportunity to refer to such evidence during the hearing, including for purposes of cross-examination.</p>\n<p>(v) At the discretion of the hearing officer, parties (but not their advisors) will usually be given an opportunity to make a closing statement at the conclusion of the hearing.</p>\n<p>C) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Evidence</span></p>\n<p>(i) Questions and evidence about the complainant’s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant and will not be permitted, except for the limited circumstance where such questions and evidence about the complainant’s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the respondent committed the conduct alleged by the complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the complainant’s prior sexual behavior with respect to the respondent and are offered to prove consent.</p>\n<p>(ii) Information protected under a legally recognized privilege (such as, for example, privileged communications between a party and their physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in a treatment capacity, or privileged communications between a party and their attorney), are not relevant unless the person holding the privilege has waived the privilege in writing and the hearing officer determines it is relevant.</p>\n<p>(iii) If a party or witness does not submit to cross-examination at the live hearing, the hearing officer will not rely on any statement of that party or witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility; provided, however, that the hearing officer will not draw an inference about the determination regarding responsibility based solely on a party’s or witness’s absence from the live hearing or refusal to answer cross-examination or other questions.</p>\n<h2>G. Record of Hearings</h2>\n<p>Middlebury will create an audio or audiovisual recording, or transcript, of any live hearing and make it available to the parties for inspection and review.</p>\n<h2>H. Determinations Regarding Responsibility</h2>\n<p>Within a reasonable time, the hearing officer (and if necessary the sanctioning authority, as provided below) will prepare and issue a written determination regarding responsibility and a recommendation on sanctions. In determining responsibility, the hearing officer will apply the preponderance of the evidence standard. The written determination will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identification of the section(s) of Middlebury’s Non-Discrimination Policy alleged to have been violated</li>\n<li>A description of the procedural steps taken from the receipt of the complaint through the determination, including but not limited to, as applicable, any notifications to the parties, interviews with parties and witnesses, site visits, methods used to gather other evidence, and hearings held</li>\n<li>Findings of fact supporting the determination</li>\n<li>Conclusions regarding the application of definitions of Title IX Sexual Harassment in Middlebury’s Non-Discrimination Policy to the facts;</li>\n<li>A statement of, and rationale for, the result as to each allegation, including a determination regarding responsibility; and</li>\n<li>Identification of Middlebury’s procedures and permissible bases for the Complainant and Respondent to appeal (as outlined below).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The determination regarding responsibility becomes final either on the date that Middlebury provides the parties with the written determination of the appeal, if an appeal is filed, or if an appeal is not filed, the date on which the appeal would no longer be considered timely.</p>\n<p>If sanctions are necessary, they will be assigned in accordance with the Sanctions section below. The parties will receive notice simultaneously of the written determination and, if necessary, any sanctions as determined through the procedures outlined below.</p>\n<h2>VI. Sanctioning</h2>\n<p>1. If the hearing officer finds that the respondent engaged in behavior that violates Middlebury policy, the CRTIX Coordinator will, in accordance with this Procedure, forward the case to the appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue (“sanctioning authority”), who will assign a sanction or sanctions, and other actions as appropriate. The hearing officer and the sanctioning authority will collaborate on the creation of a single written determination that will include the hearing officer’s statement and rationale regarding responsibility as described in more detail above, a statement of and rationale for any disciplinary action Middlebury is imposing on the respondent, and whether remedies designed to restore or preserve equal access to the educational program or activity of Middlebury will be provided by Middlebury to the complainant.</p>\n<p>In determining the sanction or sanctions and/or other actions, the sanctioning authority will be guided by a number of considerations, including but not limited to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The severity, pervasiveness and/or objective offensiveness of the behavior;</li>\n<li>The nature of the Title IX Sexual Harassment;</li>\n<li>The impact of the Title IX Sexual Harassment on the complainant;</li>\n<li>The impact or implications of the Title IX Sexual Harassment within the Middlebury community;</li>\n<li>Any prior misconduct by the respondent, including the respondent’s relevant prior conduct history, at Middlebury or elsewhere;</li>\n<li>Whether the respondent has accepted responsibility for the Title IX Sexual Harassment;</li>\n<li>The maintenance of a safe, nondiscriminatory and respectful environment conducive to living, learning, and/or working, as applicable; and</li>\n<li>Any other mitigating, aggravating, or compelling factors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a student respondent is found responsible for sexual assault, suspension or expulsion are the likely outcomes.</p>\n<p>2. Sanctions and other actions will go into effect at either the expiration of the deadline for the submission of an appeal where no appeal is submitted, or at the conclusion of the appeal process if applicable. This language does not preclude the possibility of emergency action as needed; please see Section II.D, Emergency Removals and Non-Student Administrative Leave.</p>\n<p>3. If the hearing officer finds conduct that violates the Non-Discrimination Policy (or other Middlebury policies under investigation), the CRTIX Coordinator will provide the case materials to the appropriate supervisory authority or authorities (e.g., for students: the Vice President for Student Affairs at the College,  the Dean of the Language Schools, the Dean of Enrollment, Advising and Student Services at the Institute, the Dean of the Bread Loaf School of English, etc.; for staff, that staff member’s supervisor, and for faculty, the Provost). When multiple supervisory authorities are involved in assigning sanctions, they may collaborate with each other as appropriate.</p>\n<p>After a review of the case materials and the hearing officer’s recommendation regarding sanctions, the supervisory authority may impose disciplinary sanctions.  Sanctioning and appeals for faculty whose primary appointment is in the undergraduate college will follow the procedures for Middlebury College faculty, regardless of the program for which the individual was employed at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p>Sanctions for Prohibited Conduct could include written reprimands, probationary status, letters of official discipline, and/or suspension, expulsion, reassignment of duties, referral to other disciplinary processes, or termination from employment from any or all Middlebury program(s). Students should note that although sanctions for violation(s) of this policy can include any form of discipline as stated in this section, those found to have committed sexual assault will most likely receive a sanction of suspension or expulsion.  Middlebury may also take other non-disciplinary action as deemed appropriate under the circumstances (e.g., remedies applied to the respondent to address the needs of the complainant, including but not limited to room changes, class changes, building restrictions, extracurricular activity restrictions, modification of No Contact Orders to favor the complainant, and other actions designed to restore or preserve the complainant’s equal access to Middlebury’s educational program or activity). Middlebury may also provide notice of the matter to the appropriate supervisory authority of any Middlebury program in which the respondent intends to participate, who may consider this information in determining the respondent's admission to the program and/or other program participation parameters, as appropriate. Notification of a finding of responsibility, sanction, or other action under this policy may also be provided to the home institution of non-Middlebury undergraduate and graduate students or any other program in which the student is enrolled or to which the student is pursuing enrollment.</p>\n<p>4. If the hearing officer finds that a <strong>faculty member</strong> has engaged in conduct that violates this policy, or other Middlebury policies under investigation, if applicable (absent or following an appeal of that finding in accordance with paragraph G3, above, if an appeal was granted), the CRTIX Coordinator and/or HRO will provide the case materials to the appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue (e.g., the Middlebury College VPAA/Dean of Faculty, VPAA/Dean of the Institute, Vice President of the Language Schools, Dean of International Programs or Executive Vice President/Provost). The supervisory authority will refer the matter for separate procedures that may result in the imposition of appropriate disciplinary action according to the procedures in existing Faculty Handbook policies and/or contracts, as applicable. Disciplinary sanctions under this policy may therefore include written reprimands, salary freeze, termination of employment, reassignment or restriction of duties, and/or referral to separate procedures that govern employment status issues.</p>\n<p>5. In any case in which a finding of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking or related retaliation has been issued, violation of a plan or directive to address the prohibited conduct or related sanction may be grounds for further discipline.</p>\n<h2>VII. Appeals</h2>\n<p>Either party may file an appeal from: 1) a determination regarding responsibility; and/or 2) the CRTIX Coordinator’s dismissal of a formal complaint or any allegations therein from the Title IX Sexual Harassment process, solely on the basis of one or more of the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;</li>\n<li>New evidence that could  affect the outcome of the matter and that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility or dismissal was made has become available; and/or</li>\n<li>The CRTIX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision-maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally, or the individual complainant or respondent, that affected the outcome of the matter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regardless of which party appeals, both parties may participate in the appeals process. Middlebury will provide written notification to the complainant and the respondent of any applicable appeal procedures at the time they receive the written determination regarding responsibility and any sanctions.</p>\n<p>An appeal must be made in writing to the appropriate appellate officer, which are:</p>\n<p>1. Students:</p>\n<p>a. Undergraduate College students (including non-Middlebury students enrolled in Middlebury summer undergraduate courses): <strong>VPAA/Dean of Faculty or designee</strong></p>\n<p>b. Middlebury Institute students: <strong>VPAA/Dean of the Institute or designee</strong></p>\n<p>c. All other students in any other program:  <strong>Executive Vice President/Provost or designee</strong></p>\n<p>2. Staff: <strong>VP of HR</strong><br>\n3. Faculty: <strong>Executive Vice President/Provost or designee</strong></p>\n<p>An appeal must articulate one of the three bases above and provide information to support the appealing party’s argument. Appeals must be filed no later than 5 business days after the date on which Middlebury transmitted the hearing officer’s written determination to the parties. The CRTIX Coordinator or appellate officer may extend this deadline if warranted by the circumstances. Middlebury reserves the right to assign an alternate appellate officer to avoid a conflict of interest or bias.  The appellate officer will not be the same person as the hearing officer, the investigator, the CRTIX Coordinator, or a person who made a decision to dismiss a formal complaint.</p>\n<p>Middlebury will notify the other party in writing when an appeal is filed and implement appeal procedures equally for both parties. The other party may then have a period of 5 business days to submit a statement in support of the written determination and/or in opposition to the appeal. Any such statement will be shared with the party who filed the appeal and their advisor.</p>\n<p>The appellate officer will issue a written decision describing the result of the appeal and the rationale for the result; and Middlebury will provide the written decision simultaneously to both parties. The appellate officer’s decision on any appeal is the final step in the adjudication process, unless the appellate officer provides otherwise as discussed below.</p>\n<p>The appellate officer may uphold the determination by the sanctioning authority, or modify the determination by the sanctioning authority or return the case to the original hearing officer (or an alternate, if warranted) in the event that the appellate officer concludes that either (1) a procedural irregularity affected the outcome of the matter;  (2) new evidence that could affect the outcome, and which was not available at the time of the determination, has become available; or (3) a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or the individual complainant or respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.</p>\n<p>It is the responsibility of the appellate officer to determine which if any aspects of the case merit a new review, and to direct the CRTIX Coordinator accordingly.</p>\n<p>Absent extenuating circumstances, the appellate officer will notify the complainant and respondent of the appeal decision simultaneously in writing within twenty business days of the appeal receipt deadline and will notify the CRTIX Coordinator in writing of any instructions for further action. This deadline may be extended if warranted by the circumstances. If this deadline is extended, the parties will be notified in writing at the time the extension is determined.</p>\n<p>The decision to uphold or modify the determination by the appellate officer is final. If a case is returned for an additional hearing, the subsequent determination and/or sanction from that hearing are ordinarily final.</p>\n<p><strong>Pending Discipline (Students)</strong></p>\n<p>A student respondent will not be permitted to graduate from or otherwise be deemed to have officially completed a program in which they are enrolled while a disciplinary matter is pending; the student’s graduation or certification will be held in abeyance until the matter is resolved. If a respondent withdraws with a disciplinary matter, sanction, or appeal pending, the withdrawal will be considered a resignation from Middlebury, and the student will have given up the opportunity to return to Middlebury. The student’s official status at Middlebury will reflect the point in the process at which they withdrew, and the nature of the finding and sanction, as appropriate. Examples include but are not limited to \"Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Matter Pending,\" \"Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Sanction Pending,\" and \"Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Appeal Pending.\"</p>\n<p>In extraordinary circumstances, the appropriate supervisory authority may, after appropriate consultation, a review of the case, and consideration of Middlebury’s best interests, grant permission for a respondent to withdraw from Middlebury when a disciplinary matter is pending. If the student is readmitted to Middlebury, the disciplinary matter must be resolved either before the student's return, or immediately upon the student's return (as determined by Middlebury).</p>\n<h2>VIII. Admission of Responsibility</h2>\n<p>If at any point a respondent chooses to accept responsibility for violating all policies under investigation, an official designated by the CRTIX Coordinator will issue a determination and refer the matter to the appropriate supervisory authority or authorities for the program at issue in accordance with this Procedure. The appropriate supervisory authority or authorities will issue a sanction and/or take other action that is designed to restore or preserve the complainant’s equal access to Middlebury’s education program or activity.</p>\n<h2>IX. Informal Resolution</h2>\n<h2>A. General Information</h2>\n<p>Informal resolution is a voluntary option that does not involve a hearing process. Informal resolution may be used in Title IX Sexual Harassment matters in which a formal complaint has been filed by a complainant or signed by the CRTIX Coordinator.</p>\n<p>The CRTIX Coordinator will assess the request for informal resolution in light of factors such as, but not limited to, the severity of the alleged violation and the potential risks to campus community members posed by the reported misconduct. Middlebury will only proceed with an informal resolution process if both parties provide their voluntary, written consent to initiate the informal resolution process. Middlebury will not offer or facilitate an informal resolution process in matters that involve allegations that an employee committed Title IX Sexual Harassment against a student.</p>\n<p>At any time prior to reaching a determination regarding responsibility, Middlebury may facilitate an informal resolution process (e.g., mediation or restorative justice) where requested by one party and agreed to by the other party. If a party requests the initiation of an informal resolution process and the CRTIX Coordinator agrees that the matter is appropriate for informal resolution, Middlebury will provide to each party a written notice that discloses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The allegations;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The requirements of the informal resolution process, including the circumstances under which it precludes the parties from resuming a formal complaint arising from the same allegations-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As noted below, Middlebury generally permits parties to withdraw from the informal resolution process and initiate or re-initiate a formal investigation and hearing process at any time before the informal resolution process is completed and any informal resolution is agreed to in writing by the parties); and</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any consequences resulting from participating in the informal resolution process, including the records that will be maintained or could be shared.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The matter will be deemed resolved if and when the parties expressly agree in writing to an outcome that is acceptable to them and which is approved by the CRTIX Coordinator (in consultation with other Middlebury administrators as deemed necessary).  A party may withdraw from the informal resolution process at any time prior to their execution of a written informal resolution agreement. After an informal resolution is agreed to in writing between the parties, neither party may initiate a formal resolution process regarding substantially the same factual allegations.</p>\n<p>At any time before a matter is resolved through informal resolution, the CRTIX Coordinator may terminate an informal resolution process and initiate or re-initiate a formal investigation and hearing process at any time, as they deem appropriate in their discretion.</p>\n<h2>X. Training of Individuals Conducting Investigations and Adjudications and Facilitating Informal Resolution Processes </h2>\n<p>The CRTIX Coordinator, investigators, decision-makers, sanctioning authorities, appellate authorities, and individuals facilitating informal resolution processes (collectively, “Middlebury Officials”) receive training on the definition of Title IX Sexual Harassment in this policy, the scope of Middlebury’s education programs or activities, how to serve impartially (including by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at issue, conflicts of interest, and bias), and on issues of relevance of evidence as well as questions, including when questions and evidence about the complainant’s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant. Any materials used to train Middlebury Officials will not rely on sex stereotypes and will promote impartial adjudications of formal complaints. Middlebury will ensure that all Middlebury Officials comply with the standards on serving impartially that are outlined in this paragraph.</p>\n<h2>XI. Record Keeping </h2>\n<p>The HROs and the CRTIX Coordinator will maintain as required by the May 2020 Title IX regulations any records related to Title IX Title IX Sexual Harassment cases, and will keep confidential records and/or reports under this policy and the actions taken in response to those reports.</p>\n<h2>APPENDIX A</h2>\n<h2>A. DEFINITIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Complainant</strong></p>\n<p>A complainant is an individual who is reported to have experienced conduct that could constitute Prohibited Conduct, regardless of whether the individual makes a report or seeks disciplinary action</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Respondent</strong></p>\n<p>A respondent is an individual who has been reported to have engaged in conduct that could constitute Prohibited Conduct and whose alleged conduct is being investigated to determine if it is in violation of Middlebury’s policies.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Report</strong></p>\n<p>A Report is any information received by Middlebury College that a complainant has allegedly been subjected to conduct  which could constitute Title IX Sexual Harassment.  A Report is not a Formal Complaint and does not trigger a formal investigation or adjudication. Instead, reports serve as a basis for statistical reporting under the Jeanne Clery Act, and allow Middlebury to provide Supportive Measures to those who have experienced Title IX Sexual Harassment. Any Complainant who reports Title IX Sexual Harassment will receive information about the Formal Complaint and Investigation Process.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Formal Complaint</strong></p>\n<p>Formal complaint means a document filed by a complainant or signed by the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator alleging Title IX Sexual Harassment against a respondent and requesting that the recipient investigate the allegation of Title IX Sexual Harassment. At the time of filing a formal complaint, a complainant must be participating in or attempting to participate in the education program or activity of the recipient with which the formal complaint is filed. A formal complaint may be filed with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, or by electronic mail, by using the contact information required to be listed for the Title IX Coordinator under § 106.8(a), and by any additional method designated by the recipient.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Human Relations Officer</strong></p>\n<p>A Human Relations Officer (“HRO”) is an administrator responsible for overseeing investigations and adjudicating complaints under this Procedure. HROs are also the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator’s designees responsible for overseeing investigations and adjudicating sexual misconduct complaints in accordance with this Procedure.</p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator</strong></p>\n<p>The Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator (\"CRTIX Coordinator\") is the administrator designated and authorized to coordinate Middlebury’s efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Title IX. The CRTIX Coordinator’s responsibilities include overseeing the process for handling and responding to all complaints of possible sex discrimination and identifying and addressing any patterns or systemic problems that arise during the review of such complaints.</p>\n<p>Middlebury’s CRTIX Coordinator also participates in Middlebury’s handling and responding to complaints of sexual misconduct, domestic and dating violence and misconduct, and stalking, as defined in this policy.</p>\n<p>References throughout this Procedure to the CRTIX should be read as including individuals to whom the CRTIX has designated certain duties either in general or in the context of a particular case or situation.</p>\n<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Days</strong></p>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, “days” indicates calendar days, regardless of whether the majority of Middlebury’s administrative offices are open. “Business days” indicates days on which the majority of Middlebury’s administrative offices are open, and generally connotes Mondays through Fridays. In computing any period of time referenced in this Procedure, the day of the act or event (e.g., provision of evidence for review and response, issuance of a determination or sanction) from which the designated time period begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included if it is a business day; when not a business day, the period will conclude at the end of the next business day.</p>\n<p><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Parties</strong></p>\n<p>Only the complainant and respondent are considered a “party” or “parties” as that term is used within this policy.</p>\n<p>Published: August 14, 2020</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" id=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> Note that Schools Abroad are covered under AHD</p>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\" id=\"_ftn2\">[2]</a> Middlebury’s Vermont undergraduate campus program includes a confidential resource called MiddSafe; for more information, see <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/health-wellness-education-and-safety/education/middsafe\">https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/health-wellness-education-and-saf...</a>.</p>"},"1a14e853-cded-5ab2-b6f6-ee93d102eb54":{"id":"1a14e853-cded-5ab2-b6f6-ee93d102eb54","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies","title":"II.

The CBRT will involve other members of the community in its response when appropriate. The CBRT’s goal is to take appropriate measures in responding to bias incidents and to provide educational interventions to the Middlebury community.\n\nThe CBRT does not have the authority to conduct disciplinary proceedings or impose discipline on students, staff or faculty. Disciplinary matters will be referred and handled in accordance with Middlebury’s policies, as applicable. Accordingly, complaints of misconduct should be addressed as follows:\n\n- Complaints of misconduct related to the behavior of students should be directed to a [Judicial Affairs Officer](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/judicial-affairs);\n- Complaints of misconduct related to the behavior of staff members should be directed to [Human Resources](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/business/hr);\n- Complaints of misconduct related to the behavior of faculty members should be directed to the [Dean of the Faculty](https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/administration/aa_staff/node/481277).\n\nConcerns of potential harassment or discrimination prohibited by Middlebury’s Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy should be directed to a [Human Relations Officer and/or the Title IX Coordinator](https://www.middlebury.edu/college/student-life) for review. When the CBRT is informed of conduct that could potentially violate Middlebury’s Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy, the CBRT will so inform the Title IX office.\n\nAdditional information about the CBRT and its members can be found [here](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/community-bias-response-team).\n\n## <a name=\"What\" id=\"What\"></a>What is bias?\n\nMiddlebury defines a bias incident as a single act or multiple acts directed toward an individual or group on the basis of actual or perceived race, creed, color, place of birth, ancestry, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, service in the armed forces of the United States, positive-HIV-related blood test results, disability, culture, socio-economic status, spirituality or any combination of these or other related factors, with the purpose or effect, from the point of view of a reasonable person, of negatively impacting another. Bias incidents include, but are not limited to: slurs, degrading language, epithets, graffiti, vandalism, intimidation, symbols, and harassment; that are directed toward or affect the targeted individual or team.  Incidents of bias may contribute to a hostile campus environment and can occur even if the act itself is unintentional or delivered as a joke, prank, or having humorous intent.\n\nThis definition is meant neither to proscribe nor to inhibit discussions in or out of the classroom of complex, controversial, or sensitive matters such as those listed above.\n\nNote: This definition of a bias incident is intentionally broad to reflect our values to create and sustain an inclusive, safe, and productive community for all of our members.\n\n## <a name=\"Other\" id=\"Other\"></a>Other Applicable Information\n\n**<span><a name=\"Harassment\" id=\"Harassment\"></a>Harassment</span>**\n\nIn accordance with Middlebury’s Anti-Harrassment/Discrimination policy, harassment is defined as verbal, written, visual, or physical conduct based on or motivated by an individual's actual or perceived sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, race, creed, color, place of birth, ancestry, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, disability, marital status, or other characteristics as defined and protected by law in the location where a particular program is operating, that has the purpose or effect, from the point of view of a reasonable person, of objectively and substantially:\n\na. undermining and detracting from or interfering with an individual's educational or work performance or access to Middlebury resources; or\n\nb. creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive educational, work, or living environment.\n\nHarassment may include repeated slurs, or taunts in the guise of jokes, or disparaging references to others, use of epithets, stereotypes, comments, gestures, threats, graffiti, display or circulation of written or visual materials, taunts on manner of speech, and negative reference to customs when such conduct is based on or motivated by one or more of the protected characteristics identified above, or other characteristics as defined and protected by applicable law.\n\nIn Middlebury’s Vermont programs, harassment may also include conduct of the type described above that is based on or motivated by a student's family member's actual or perceived race, creed, color, national origin, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, which has the type of purpose or effect described above.\n\nSee also “[Sexual Harassment](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/antiharassment#Definitions)” as defined by Middlebury’s Anti-Harassment/Discrimination policy.\n\nPossible incidents of harassment should be directed to the [Title IX Coordinator, a Human Relations Officer](https://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/hro/node/285479) or [Public Safety](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety).\n\n**<span><a name=\"Hate\" id=\"Hate\"></a>Hate Crime</span>**\n\nVermont law defines a hate crime as any crime maliciously motivated by the victim’s actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, ancestry, age, service in the armed forces of the United States, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity (13 V.S.A Sec. 1455).  Hate crimes may include attempted crimes. Common hate crimes include:\n\n- Assaults (hitting, punching, spitting)\n- Disorderly Conduct (public threatening behavior)\n- Unlawful Mischief (property crime)\n- Harassment by telephone (including repeated hang up calls)\n\nPossible incidents of hate crimes should be directed to the [Title IX Coordinator, a Human Relations Officer](https://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/hro/node/285479) or [Public Safety](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety).\n\n**<span><a name=\"Community\" id=\"Community\"></a>Community Standards</span>**\n\nPlease see the full text of Middlebury's [Community Standards](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/a-introductory-matters#community-standards).\n\n**<span><a name=\"Anti\" id=\"Anti\"></a>Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy; Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic and Dating Violence and Misconduct, and Stalking</span>**\n\nFor information on filing reports under these policies, please refer to the following links:\n\n[Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin)\n\n[Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic and Dating Violence and Misconduct, and Stalking](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October)\n\n**<span><a name=\"Non\" id=\"Non\"></a>Non-Discrimination Statement</span>**\n\nMiddlebury College (\"Middlebury\") complies with applicable provisions of state and federal law which prohibit discrimination in employment, or in admission or access to its educational or extracurricular programs, activities, or facilities, on the basis of race, creed, color, place of birth, ancestry, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, service in the armed forces of the United States, positive HIV-related blood test results, genetic information, or against qualified individuals with disabilities on the basis of disability and/or any other status or characteristic as defined and to the extent protected by applicable law. Middlebury also complies with all other anti-discrimination protections that might be provided by particular states in which it operates educational programs; questions about the scope of any such protections should be addressed to the [Compliance Officer/Title IX Coordinator](https://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/hro) and/or the on-site administrative representative for the particular program at issue. The Compliance Officer/Title IX Coordinator coordinates Middlebury's efforts to comply with any and all federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of one or more of the protected characteristics listed above. Discrimination complaints are processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Middlebury's [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](https://www.middlebury.edu/middlebury_google_custom_search/go/anti-harassment).\n\n**<span><a name=\"Notice\" id=\"Notice\"></a>Notice</span>**\n\nNothing in this policy alters, amends, or modifies Middlebury’s Student Life Policies, the College Handbook (including but not limited to Middlebury’s Anti-Harassment/Discrimination policy and Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic and Dating Violence and Misconduct, and Stalking), and/or other applicable Middlebury policies. If any conflict or apparent conflict exists, Middlebury’s Student Life Policy, College Handbook, and/or other applicable Middlebury policy controls.\n\n**<span><a name=\"Confidentiality\" id=\"Confidentiality\"></a>Confidentiality</span>**\n\nAll reports under this policy will be handled in a sensitive manner. Information will be shared with others only to the extent necessary to assess and manage the situation in compliance with Middlebury policies, or state and federal law.\n\nIn general, the law recognizes and protects the confidentiality of communications between a person seeking care and a medical or mental health professional, religious advisor or MiddSafe advocate. The medical, mental health, religious professionals and MiddSafe advocates at Middlebury and their off-campus counterparts respect and protect confidential communications from students, faculty, and staff to the extent they are legally able to do so. These professionals may have to disclose information when they perceive a serious risk of danger or threat to any person or property. In addition, medical and mental health professionals may be required by law to report certain crimes (e.g., any allegation of sexual and/or physical abuse of a person under 18). These exceptions to confidentiality are governed by the law of the state in which the confidential resource is located.\n\nAn individual who exclusively reports allegations to a confidential resource must understand that Middlebury may be unable to evaluate the allegations and/or pursue disciplinary action against any individual who may have engaged in prohibited behavior.\n\nThe CBRT will handle information with sensitivity and discretion. However, the CBRT may need to disclose allegations and/or other information (including the identity of parties and/or witnesses) to the extent necessary to allow Middlebury to proceed with an investigation and/or adjudication under applicable policies.\n\n**<span><a name=\"disclosure_req\" id=\"disclosure_req\"></a>Disclosure Required by Law</span>**<span></span>\n\nMiddlebury will not include the names of complainants or other identifying information in publicly available reports that are compiled as required by the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. Middlebury is part of a larger community, and a variety of additional factors and/or legal requirements may apply.  As an example, if there is an investigation, lawsuit, or criminal proceeding related to a bias incident or hate crime, the parties, witnesses, and/or Middlebury officials may be required by law to provide testimony or documents (e.g., investigation reports, witness statements, and any other information gathered or obtained in the course of a particular matter).\n\n**<span><a name=\"DisTo\" id=\"DisTo\"></a>Disclosure to Law Enforcement</span>**<span></span>\n\nIn certain circumstances, Middlebury may report an incident to law enforcement authorities. Such circumstances include but are not limited to incidents that warrant the undertaking of safety and security measures for the protection of the individual and/or the campus community, or situations in which there is clear and imminent danger and/or a weapon may be involved. Complainants may always choose to notify authorities directly with or without Middlebury’s assistance, or may choose not to notify such authorities.\n\n**<span><a name=\"Retaliation\" id=\"Retaliation\"></a>Retaliation</span>**<span></span>\n\nRetaliating directly or indirectly against a person who has in good faith made a report under this policy or who has supported or participated in an investigation related to a bias incident is prohibited. Retaliation includes but is not limited to ostracizing the person, pressuring the person to drop the report or not participate in the investigation, or to provide false or misleading information, or engaging in conduct that may reasonably be perceived to affect adversely that person’s educational, living, or work environment. Depending on the circumstances, retaliation may be unlawful, whether or not the report is ultimately found to have merit. An individual who engages in retaliation under this policy will be subject to discipline in accordance with the College’s Handbook, Student Life Policies/General Disciplinary Processes, Anti-Harassment/Discrimination policy, or other policies applicable to the program at issue.\n\n**<span><a name=\"Additional\" id=\"Additional\"></a>Additional Resources</span>**\n\nFor additional resources for targeted persons of bias incidents or hate crimes, please click [here](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin#B).\n","excerpt":"In effect as of September 1, 2016 Overview What is Bias?

They need to be fair and principled in their official interactions and to act in good faith in these matters with others both within and outside the Middlebury community. They should act with due recognition of their position of trust and loyalty with respect to the College and its students, fellow employees, research sponsors, and donors. When in doubt about the propriety of a proposed course of action, they should seek counsel from those colleagues, supervisors, or administrators who can assist in determining the right and appropriate course of conduct.\n\n**Proper Use of College Property and Funds**\n\nMiddlebury faculty and staff must see to it that College resources are not used for other than their intended purposes.  College employees have an obligation to manage the institution's resources prudently, with a responsibility to those who provide those resources, including students, parents, alumni, foundations, other donors, and government agencies. Faculty and staff are responsible for safeguarding the tangible and intangible assets of the College that are under their control. College resources may not be converted to personal use, either for oneself or another person. College funds may not be used to make contributions to candidates for public office, to political parties, or to other political organizations that are organized and operated primarily to accept contributions and make expenditures for the purpose of influencing the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to federal, state, or local public office or office in a political organization, or the election of Presidential electors. College funds may not be used to support defamation.\n\n**Accuracy of Records and Reporting**\n\nThe records, data, and information owned, used, and managed by the College must be accurate and complete. The accuracy and reliability of financial reports is of the utmost importance to the business operations of the College. Faculty and staff must record, allocate, and charge costs accurately and maintain supporting documentation as required by established policies and procedures. All reports, vouchers, bills, invoices, payroll information, personnel records, and other essential business records must be prepared with care and honesty.\n\n**Grants and Contracts**\n\nMembers of the faculty and staff requesting funding from government agencies, corporations, foundations, and other granting organizations have an affirmative obligation to make full, accurate, and honest representations concerning all relevant information submitted to or requested by the granting organization. Accurate and complete records, including supporting documentation as required by the granting organization, of the uses to which grant funds are put must be maintained.\n\n**Confidential Information**\n\nMembers of the faculty and staff may be privy to confidential information in the course of their daily work. This information may relate to, among others, students, parents, alumni, donors, employees, and candidates for positions on the faculty or staff. All College employees must safeguard confidential information. This includes ensuring that confidential documents, in either paper or electronic form, are not left unattended; refraining from engaging in discussion of confidential information in forums where the information may be overheard; and protecting the privacy of past and present students, faculty, and staff by maintaining the confidentiality of student and employee records.\n\n**Conflicts of Interest**\n\nMembers of the faculty and staff should avoid improper conflicts of interest that might compromise the integrity and objectivity of the College. Examples of situations involving potential conflicts of interest include working for the College as an outside vendor; using information that the College considers privileged or confidential for the benefit of a person or entity outside the College; utilizing discounts allowed to the College for personal gain; and soliciting for oneself or for a third party anything of value from any person or entity in return for any business or service provided by the College.\n\nFinancial conflicts of interest (for example, an employee's participating in the ownership or management of an entity that regularly does business with the College) should be disclosed, reviewed, and appropriately managed or eliminated.  No member of the faculty or staff may approve, recommend, or promote a business transaction with a firm in which that person is an officer or senior management employee, or holds more than a 5 percent equity interest, unless such person first discloses in writing the business relationship and the circumstances of the contemplated activity to the Office of the Executive Vice President and Treasurer.\n\nNo member of the faculty and staff shall solicit anything of value in return for influencing or exercising his or her discretion in a particular way on a College matter.  Faculty and staff should not accept any material gift, gratuity, or other payment, in cash or in kind, from a vendor currently doing business with the College or seeking to do so. Members of the faculty and staff may not solicit or receive discounts or rebates on goods and services offered to them in their private capacity by vendors to the College that exceed those generally available to other customers.

Middlebury Staff Council (MSC) Constitution","body":"\n**Article I. Name**\n\nThe name of this organization is the Middlebury Staff Council (hereinafter referred to as MSC).\n\n**Article II. Purpose**\n\nThe purpose of the MSC is to help make Middlebury a great place to work. The MSC is elected by the staff employees, and acknowledged by the Board of Trustees, to establish priorities for the staff. The MSC's responsibilities include, but are not limited to:\n\n**A.** Listen and respond to the ideas, opinions, problems, concerns, and consider other matters;\n\n**B**. Organize data, staff views, and other information into reports, and formulate recommendations for actions, changes, and solutions, as required;\n\n**C.** Convey reports and recommendations to Middlebury’s administration;\n\n**D.** Meet with the Middlebury administration on a regular basis to communicate reports and recommendations;\n\n**Article III. Members, Officers, and Elections**\n\n**A. Membership**\n\nVoting membership of the MSC consists of one Middlebury staff employee for each District and At-Large position. A staff member from Human Resources serves as a non-voting member. Voting members of the MSC serve two-year terms, which begin on the first Monday after their election. Expiring terms are refilled by election. Each voting member serves on at least one MSC committee and/or the MSC Executive Committee.\n\nThe Staff Council will be charged with dividing the staff into up to 12 group districts. Thirty days prior to redistricting, staff will be notified of any changes. \n\nThe current assignment of positions to an employee work group or campus district is attached as Appendix A. These assignments can be changed from time to time by the MSC Election Committee subject to the approval of the MSC. Composition of campus districts is monitored by the MSC to assure balanced representation.\n\nBenefits-eligible employees working in the United States (full-time and part-time) whose primary designation is not faculty, are eligible to participate in MSC meetings, to vote in MSC elections and to serve as elected MSC representatives.  \n\n**B. Officers**\n\nA president, vice president, and co-secretaries are elected from among the voting members of the MSC by its voting members. Each officer serves for one year and may be reelected. The four officers of the MSC make up the MSC Executive Committee.\n\n**a.** The MSC president presides at meetings of the MSC, prepares the agenda for MSC meetings, and casts a vote in case of a tie vote. In addition, the MSC president is the official representative of the staff and the MSC to the Middlebury president and the Middlebury community at large. The MSC president also serves as the budget administrator for the MSC budget, which is a regular Middlebury budget account. The president may choose to appoint any MSC member to serve as budget administrator. The MSC president serves as an_ ex officio_ member of all MSC committees.\n\n**b.** The MSC vice president presides at MSC meetings in the absence of the MSC president, provides general assistance to the MSC president, and serves as the MSC representative to the Community Council.\n\n**c.** The MSC secretaries share responsibility for the secretarial duties of the MSC. Those duties include but are not limited to: taking minutes of each MSC meeting and distributing these minutes to all MSC members and to appropriate locations on campus; informing MSC members and staff employees of the date, time, location, and agenda of MSC meetings; maintaining the records of the MSC. Allocation of secretarial duties is determined by the secretaries and the MSC.\n\nThe MSC meets annually with the senior representative from Human Resources and the senior financial officer or their designee to review general guidelines and practices for staff salaries and benefits for the purpose of recommending improvements in these areas. The MSC meets periodically with representatives of the Board of Trustees and with the Middlebury president to communicate staff issues.\n\nWhen necessary, the MSC Executive Committee may reassign duties among the executive officers. In the event that a member of the MSC Executive Committee is unable to attend a meeting, another member of the MSC may be appointed by the MSC president to serve at that meeting. If a member of the Executive Committee resigns or is unable to continue in office, MSC representatives will elect a new officer to complete the unexpired term.  \n\n**C. Elections**\n\nMSC elections are held annually in May.\n\nThe MSC Election Committee, under the direction of the MSC, develops election procedures, establishes election deadlines, recruits candidates, and conducts nominations and elections for MSC representatives, validates the results, and resolves any problems that arise from the election process.\n\nAll voting is by secret ballot.\n\n**Nomination Procedure**\n\n**a.** Four weeks before the final election date, election procedures, including deadlines and nomination forms, are sent to all staff employees whose representatives are up for election.\n\n**b.** The nomination forms for representatives of specific employee work groups or campus districts list the names of all eligible employees in that group or district and are distributed to members of that group or district only.\n\n**c.** Staff employees may nominate one person from their specific employee work group or campus district.\n\n**d.** In the case of the member-at-large, the nomination form provides space for one write-in candidate. A list of all staff employees eligible for nomination will be distributed. Nominations must be made from that list.\n\n**e.** Nomination by official ballot takes place at least three weeks before the date of the final election.\n\nf. A nominee may decline to run for office.\n\n**Election Procedure**\n\n**a.** At least two weeks in advance of the final election date, the Election Committee sends out ballots to voting staff employees.\n\n**b.** The staff employees who received the most nominations and agree<span>d</span> to run are listed on the ballot for each vacant representative's seat.<span> </span>In any given election, the Election Committee, with the approval of the MSC, may choose to limit the number of nominees who will be listed on the election ballot (although the same limitation will apply to all positions in a given year). The ballots also contain space for write-in candidates.\n\n**c.** Staff employees may vote once within their employee work group or campus district and once for the member-at-large representative.\n\n**d.** The candidate who receives the most votes for each vacant representative's seat in which they are eligible to serve is elected to the MSC. In case of a tie, a run-off election will be held within a month between the highest vote-getters to determine a winner.\n\nIf an MSC representative resigns or is unable to continue in office, another staff employee from the representative's employee group or campus district will be appointed by the MSC to serve.

In the case of the member-at-large, a petition must be signed by 100 eligible staff employees.\n\n**b.** Upon receipt of the petition, the MSC will conduct a recall vote within 30 days.\n\n**c.** The recall vote will be taken among the staff employees represented by the MSC member for whom the recall has been petitioned.\n\n**d.** A simple majority of those voting in favor of a recall is required for the recall to take effect. If the required number of votes is not achieved, the MSC member will remain in office.  \n\n**e.** No MSC member will undergo a recall vote more than once a year during his/her term of office.\n\n**f.** If the required number of votes for a recall is achieved, the MSC will appoint a replacement in the same manner as provided for above.\n\n**Article IV. Committees**\n\n**A. Standing Committees**\n\nEach standing committee operates under the authority of the MSC and makes recommendations for action to the MSC.

Exceptions for \"dogs at work\" are described below.\n\nAnimals visiting campus grounds shall be on a leash at all times. Animals may not be left unattended or tied to any objects (e.g., structures, trees, or vehicles). All damages caused by an animal are the responsibility of the owner or guardian of the animal at the time of the damage; repairs will be billed accordingly.\n\nAdministrative offices open to the public are considered public spaces, and no animals may be brought into them, except Service Animals.\n\n2. Exception for \"Dogs at Work\"\n\nMiddlebury employees on the College campus in Vermont may bring dogs to work in accordance with the requirements of this Policy, detailed below.  Dogs demonstrating any aggressive behavior will not be allowed on campus. Bringing a dog to work is a privilege and when other individuals’ health or participation are negatively impacted, this Policy places greater importance on the well-being and full participation of all members of our community than on the preference for bringing a dog to work.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Dogs May Not Be Registered In These Buildings (this list is subject to change at any time)</span>\n\n- Peterson Family Athletic Complex\n- McCardell Bicentennial Hall (dogs are not allowed in this building at any time)\n- The Marble Works\n- Emma Willard House\n- The Mahaney Center for the Arts (exceptions may be made for specific locations)\n- 700 Exchange Street (exceptions may be made for specific locations)\n- Davis Library (exceptions may be made for specific locations)\n\nFaculty and staff with private offices or faculty and staff who share an office may bring dogs to work during business hours only so long as they comply with all of the following requirements:\n\na.

With the approval of a supervisor or department chair, two employees who share a single office may be permitted to register their dog. However, only one dog is permitted in a single office at any given time.\n\nb. Register their dog with the Department of Public Safety by completing Part II of the form and emailing a scanned copy of the completed form (Parts I and II), plus a digital photograph of their dog, to the Department of Public Safety at [publicsafety@middlebury.edu](mailto:publicsafety@middlebury.edu) (please write “Dog Registration” in the subject line). Note that the registration process requires that your dog have a current dog license in the owner’s hometown, and that the dog tag or town dog license number be provided to Public Safety.\n\nc. When the dog is on campus, the faculty or staff member is responsible for ensuring that the Conduct Requirements spelled out below are followed.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Conduct Requirements for Dogs At Work Program</span>\n\ni.  Owners must register any participating dog with the Department of Public Safety.\n\nii.  Owners must post a sign on the office door when a dog is present.

Owners must ensure that dogs are appropriately cleaned and groomed while on campus.\n\niv.  Owners are required to clean up after their dogs, both inside and outside the office, and building.\n\nv.  Owners must keep dogs on leashes at all times when not in their office. Owners are strongly encouraged to crate their dogs if/when they leave them unattended in their office.  Dogs may not be off-leash outside of the owner’s office, including in public areas of a building. Dogs running freely through hallways and buildings is a direct violation of this policy.\n\nvi.  Owners will be financially responsible for any damage or cleaning costs resulting from the dog.\n\nvii. Custodians will not clean offices where dogs are registered, regardless of how often the dog is present in the office. Owners are responsible for cleaning their own offices.\n\nviii.  Owners must make alternate arrangements to meet with students, co-workers, visitors and/or vendors who are allergic to or uncomfortable when dogs are present in the office. It is the responsibility of the owner to notify visitors beforehand that a dog will be present in the office.\n\nd.  Enforcement.  Concerns about Dogs at Work should be directed to the Vice-President or Dean for the office or program where the dog owner works.  Violation of any of the Conduct Requirements is a basis for terminating the registration of a dog.  Failure to comply with the Conduct Requirements may result in fines, in addition to termination of registration, and repeated violations may be subject to additional sanctions.\n","excerpt":"Pet Policy and Requirements for “Dogs at Work” Pets are not allowed in Middlebury buildings including residence halls.

Appeal Procedures","body":"\n**a. Appeal of Non-reappointment**\n\n_i. Grounds for Appeal_ A faculty member who has received notice of non-reappointment may appeal that judgment on the basis of either procedural errors or violation of academic freedom that may have influenced the academic department or program, and/or the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee, and/or the provost (in the case of first and contract reviews) or the president (in the case of tenure reviews).\n\n_ii. Procedures for All Appeals_ The faculty member must notify the secretary of the Appeals Council of intent to appeal in writing within 10 days of receipt of notification of non-reappointment.\n\nThe secretary informs the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty (VPAA/DoF) and the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee of the intent to appeal.\n\nThe faculty member must submit his or her appeal and the grounds for the appeal (academic freedom or procedural error) to the secretary of the Appeals Council within 20 days after receipt of notification of non-reappointment.\n\nThe Appeals Council will select an Appeal Committee to evaluate the grounds of the appeal. The Appeal Committee does not reconsider or judge the reappointment decision itself, which remains the charge of the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee, and the provost or the president. The Appeal Committee will be composed of three members of the Appeals Council. In no case will a member of the Appeal Committee be a member of the appellant's department or someone who was involved in the reappointment review in another capacity.\n\nThe appellant is informed of the composition of the Appeal Committee by the secretary of the Appeals Council, and may request, for good cause, within a week of notification, that any member selected be disqualified from serving on the committee. Individual panel members may also request, for good cause, such disqualification. The Appeals Council decides on the validity of any such requests.\n\nThe Appeal Committee meets with the appellant, the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee, and with any other persons it deems appropriate over the course of its investigation of the appeal. The Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee explains to the Appeal Committee the procedures followed in arriving at its recommendation and the reasons for the recommendation. The provost (in the case of first and contract reviews) or the president (in the case of tenure reviews) explains to the Appeal Committee the procedures followed in reaching their decision and the reasons for the decision. The committee has access to all written documents pertaining to the reappointment decision. The contents of those documents, and all other substantive matters pertaining to the committee's investigation, are held strictly confidential. The burden of proof rests with the faculty member. At the conclusion of the investigation, the chair of the Appeal Committee submits the committee's findings, in writing, to the provost (in the case of first and contract reviews), the president (in the case of tenure reviews), members of the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee, the VPAA/DoF, and the appellant. The appellant may request meetings with the Appeal Committee before its investigation begins and at its conclusion.\n\nThe Appeal Committee will inform the appellant of its findings within 60 days of the date the appeal was submitted to the Committee. In the case of an appeal submitted after April 15, the Appeal Committee may determine that the appeal will be considered at the beginning of the subsequent fall. In such cases, the Appeal Committee will inform the appellant of its findings within 60 days of the beginning of the fall term, no later than November 10.\n\n_iii. Appeal on the Grounds of Violation of Academic Freedom_ If the Appeal Committee concludes that the appeal on grounds of a violation of academic freedom lacks adequate foundation, the provost or the president (as appropriate) will dismiss the appeal.\n\nIf the Appeal Committee concludes that there are grounds for appeal on the basis of academic freedom, the provost or the president (as appropriate) will notify the Board of Trustees and ask that the board conduct a hearing.\n\nThe board designates one of its standing committees, or appoints a committee, to hold the hearing. The hearing will be conducted in a manner that will afford the faculty member fair opportunity to present their case and to permit the committee to inquire into it. Should the faculty member so request, a portion of the hearing will be conducted with the provost (in the case of first and contract reviews) or the president (in the case of tenure reviews) not present. The VPAA/DoF will remain present throughout the appeal and maintain a record of the proceedings. The decision of the trustees is final.  \n\nIf the final decision is to reject the appeal, the non-reappointment of the faculty member will stand, and the provost (in the case of first and contract reviews) or the president (in the case of tenure reviews) will so inform the appellant. If the decision is to uphold the appeal, reappointment will be offered to the faculty member on terms no less favorable than the terms of his or her current appointment.\n\n_iv. Appeal on the Grounds of Procedural Error_ If the Appeal Committee concludes that there are grounds for an appeal on the basis of procedural errors, the chair of the Appeal Committee will direct the relevant parties to correct all of the errors cited in its report within a specified timeline, and will direct the parties to notify the chair in writing when the procedural errors have been corrected. The Appeal Committee's findings with regard to matters of procedure are binding on all parties. When notifications of all corrections has been submitted to the Appeal Committee, the chair of the Committee will forward this information to the provost (in the case of first and contract reviews) or the president (in the case of tenure reviews), the VPAA/DoF, and the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee. The VPAA/DoF will then charge the committee that made the original recommendation with reconsidering its recommendation while avoiding procedural violations. If the Appeal Committee determines that a procedural error occurred, but was immaterial to the outcome of the review, the fact that an error occurred is not in itself grounds for upholding the appeal. The Appeal Committee may note the error in its report, but conclude that it does not warrant a reconsideration of the recommendation.\n\nIf after reconsideration as the result of an appeal the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee recommends reappointment, the provost or the president (as appropriate) will reconsider their decision.\n\nIf the Appeal Committee concludes that the appeal on the grounds of procedure lacks adequate foundation, the Appeal Committee will dismiss the appeal. Upon completion of its deliberations, the Appeal Committee will prepare a confidential report to be used by future appeal committees summarizing the nature of each proposed procedural error and the Committee's decision. All information identifying individuals or departments will be excluded from the report. Copies of the section of the handbook on the rules of appointment and tenure from the year of the appeal will be filed with the report. Copies of past reports and correspondent handbook sections will be deposited with the office of the Administrative Coordinator of Faculty Affairs.","excerpt":"a. Appeal of Non-reappointment i.

Faculty Extra Service Pay policy","body":"\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nFaculty at Middlebury’s undergraduate college (hereafter, the College) have regular responsibilities for teaching, research, and service, and they are compensated for these responsibilities with their 9 month institutional base salary (IBS). The regular responsibilities encompassed in IBS are described in appointment letters, job descriptions as posted in original advertisements, and the _[Middlebury Handbook](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/faculty/faculty-rules#principles)_. At times, faculty members at the College assume various additional responsibilities that are not directly related to their regular responsibilities, or that are in addition to their regular responsibilities; these responsibilities include serving as department chairs or program directors, serving as administrative directors, as well as other additional responsibilities as determined by the VPAA/DoF. Extra service pay is made to faculty as acknowledgement of the additional responsibilities when certain conditions are met. In addition, it is important to ensure extra service pay paid from federally funded awards complies with requirements in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circular 2 CFR 200 Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards.\n\n**POLICY STATEMENT**\n\nExtra service pay is incremental to the faculty member’s 9 month academic year IBS. The extra service pay is considered benefits-eligible taxable income, but the extra service pay itself is not considered part of the faculty member’s 9 month IBS.\n\nThe VPAA/DoF determines whether an additional responsibility assumed by a faculty member falls within the terms of his/her appointment and is thus included in institutional base salary (IBS) or whether the additional responsibility is eligible for extra service pay.\n\nExtra service pay amounts are set by the VPAA/DoF taking into consideration the IBS rate of pay, amount of additional work performed, and/or consistency with payment for comparable work. For extra service pay charged to federal awards, charges cannot exceed the proportionate share of the IBS for that period, irrespective of the basis of computation.\n\nIntra-institution consulting by faculty is assumed to be undertaken as an obligation under the terms of a faculty member’s appointment and requires no compensation in addition to IBS. Extra compensation for intra-institution consulting is only paid in unusual cases, regardless of the funding source. Similar to external consulting, intra-institution consulting requires prior notification and approval by the VPAA.\n\nExtra service pay from a sponsored award from any source should be identified and justified in the original proposal if the circumstances are known at the time. Extra service pay that is paid from a sponsored award must be disclosed and approved in accordance with sponsor requirements, if applicable.\n\nThe Contracts & Grants Policy section of the _Middlebury Handbook_ states that *“Applications incorporating provisions for extra pay for research work normally will be approved to provide for up to two months of extra work during the summer. One month's summer salary is equal to 1/9th of the annual contract salary for the prior academic year. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the VPAA/DoF, upon recommendation of the director of the Sciences, director of the Arts, director of humanities or DFDR.”*  The VPAA/DoF will consider and approve faculty requests for 2.5 months of grant-funded summer salary when the sponsor allows such requests and there is sufficient documentation for that level of effort.\n\n**EXAMPLES OF RESPONSIBILITES ELIGIBLE FOR EXTRA SERVICE PAY**\n\n- Responsibilities different from or in addition to a faculty member’s regular responsibilities that do not interfere with the faculty member’s regular responsibilities. Serving as department chair or program director, and serving as an administrative director fall under this example.\n- Responsibilities for serving as project director for a limited term project, including projects funded by grants or gifts. Summer salary and serving as project director for a grant-funded program that has academic year responsibilities fall under this example.\n- Responsibilities for teaching additional classes and lectures that are not part of a faculty member’s regular responsibilities may, in rare circumstances, be considered as extra service. In most cases, however, course overloads will be addressed by adjusting teaching responsibilities in a future year, as specified in the official teaching expectations.\n- Responsibilities for work performed outside a faculty member’s department or as part of a separate or remote operation that is in addition to the faculty member’s regular responsibilities. Intra-institution consulting, such as a member of one department serving as an external evaluator on a federal grant awarded to another department, falls under this example.\n- Additional responsibilities in the event of an extraordinary circumstance that significantly increases workload.\n\n**DEFINITIONS**\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Institutional Base Salary (IBS)</span> is the annual compensation paid by Middlebury for an individual’s appointment responsibilities, whether that individual’s time is spent on teaching, research, service, or other activities. For faculty members, IBS is based on a 9 months academic year.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Regular Responsibilities</span> for teaching, research, service, or other activities are the duties compensated by IBS.

At times, faculty members at the College assume various additional responsibilities that are not directly related to their regular responsibilities, or that are in addition to their regular responsibilities; these responsibilities include serving as department chairs or program directors, serving as administrative directors, as well as other additional responsibilities as determined by the VPAA/DoF. Extra service pay is made to faculty as acknowledgement of the additional responsibilities when certain conditions are met. In addition, it is important to ensure extra service pay paid from federally funded awards complies with requirements in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circular 2 CFR 200 Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards.</p>\n<p><strong>POLICY STATEMENT</strong></p>\n<p>Extra service pay is incremental to the faculty member’s 9 month academic year IBS. The extra service pay is considered benefits-eligible taxable income, but the extra service pay itself is not considered part of the faculty member’s 9 month IBS.</p>\n<p>The VPAA/DoF determines whether an additional responsibility assumed by a faculty member falls within the terms of his/her appointment and is thus included in institutional base salary (IBS) or whether the additional responsibility is eligible for extra service pay.</p>\n<p>Extra service pay amounts are set by the VPAA/DoF taking into consideration the IBS rate of pay, amount of additional work performed, and/or consistency with payment for comparable work. For extra service pay charged to federal awards, charges cannot exceed the proportionate share of the IBS for that period, irrespective of the basis of computation.</p>\n<p>Intra-institution consulting by faculty is assumed to be undertaken as an obligation under the terms of a faculty member’s appointment and requires no compensation in addition to IBS. Extra compensation for intra-institution consulting is only paid in unusual cases, regardless of the funding source. Similar to external consulting, intra-institution consulting requires prior notification and approval by the VPAA.</p>\n<p>Extra service pay from a sponsored award from any source should be identified and justified in the original proposal if the circumstances are known at the time. Extra service pay that is paid from a sponsored award must be disclosed and approved in accordance with sponsor requirements, if applicable.</p>\n<p>The Contracts &#x26; Grants Policy section of the <em>Middlebury Handbook</em> states that <em>“Applications incorporating provisions for extra pay for research work normally will be approved to provide for up to two months of extra work during the summer. One month's summer salary is equal to 1/9th of the annual contract salary for the prior academic year. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the VPAA/DoF, upon recommendation of the director of the Sciences, director of the Arts, director of humanities or DFDR.”</em>  The VPAA/DoF will consider and approve faculty requests for 2.5 months of grant-funded summer salary when the sponsor allows such requests and there is sufficient documentation for that level of effort.</p>\n<p><strong>EXAMPLES OF RESPONSIBILITES ELIGIBLE FOR EXTRA SERVICE PAY</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Responsibilities different from or in addition to a faculty member’s regular responsibilities that do not interfere with the faculty member’s regular responsibilities. Serving as department chair or program director, and serving as an administrative director fall under this example.</li>\n<li>Responsibilities for serving as project director for a limited term project, including projects funded by grants or gifts. Summer salary and serving as project director for a grant-funded program that has academic year responsibilities fall under this example.</li>\n<li>Responsibilities for teaching additional classes and lectures that are not part of a faculty member’s regular responsibilities may, in rare circumstances, be considered as extra service. In most cases, however, course overloads will be addressed by adjusting teaching responsibilities in a future year, as specified in the official teaching expectations.</li>\n<li>Responsibilities for work performed outside a faculty member’s department or as part of a separate or remote operation that is in addition to the faculty member’s regular responsibilities. Intra-institution consulting, such as a member of one department serving as an external evaluator on a federal grant awarded to another department, falls under this example.</li>\n<li>Additional responsibilities in the event of an extraordinary circumstance that significantly increases workload.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>DEFINITIONS</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Institutional Base Salary (IBS)</span> is the annual compensation paid by Middlebury for an individual’s appointment responsibilities, whether that individual’s time is spent on teaching, research, service, or other activities.

permission of the Athletic Policy Committee and the dean of the College. No intercollegiate athletic contests will be scheduled for Monday evenings. Refer to Chapter 3, Section VI. G. Attendance of this Handbook for the \"Guidelines for Explained Absences\" revised and approved by the Athletic Policy Committee in January 2002.\n\n**b.** The Athletic Policy Committee encourages the scheduling of *JV* athletic contests for Saturdays.\n\n**c.** The total number of *B or JV* athletic contests and the number of away games are subject to continual review by the Athletic Policy Committee.\n\n**d.** Throughout the college year, those days following the end of formal classes but before the beginning of the formal examination period, will be considered as class time for purposes of scheduling intercollegiate athletic competitions. No regular-season athletic events may be scheduled during the examination period.\n\n**e.** All candidates for athletic teams must be given a physical screening at the beginning of each season, and no candidate may be a member of any team without a certificate of his or her physical qualifications.\n\n**f.** The College does not assume legal responsibility for the expense in caring for injuries sustained by athletes while training for or participating in athletic competition or intramural activities.\n\n**B. Guidelines for Handling Athletics-Explained Absences**\n\nThe list of scheduled athletics contests you receive several times a year from the director of Athletics has been approved by the Athletic Policy Committee of the faculty (APC) acting under guidelines set forth in the *[Middlebury College Handbook](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/governance/Faculty_Councils_and_Committees#athletic-policy).* This list tells you when legitimate absences from class may be expected by students because they are involved in a sanctioned athletic event scheduled for that date. The APC regards these lists as informative. They are an *explanation* for an absence, but they do not imply that the student is excused from the obligations of a course or the class work missed.\n\nAlthough faculty members are expected to make their policy on course attendance clear at the beginning of each course, it is the individual student's responsibility to consult with his or her instructor as to the effect of explained absences.\n\n_**To the Professor:**_\n\nPlease read the guidelines for students and coaches in the following sections regarding \"Explained Absences.\" Note that it is the student's responsibility to approach you in the first week of the course to identify possible conflicts between their athletics schedule and your course. However, it would be helpful if you, during the first week of classes, remind students of their obligation.\n\nHow you handle missed work is entirely up to you. However, it is the College's policy that athletics are an important part of a student's life at Middlebury. There are a number of possible solutions to missed work. For example, if a lab or discussion is missed, the student may be able to attend a different section meeting. If a paper is due, ask that the paper to be handed in prior to the student's leaving. If a lecture is to be missed, you may permit the student to record the lecture (with assistance from another student). We do recognize, however, that there are cases for which there is no satisfactory make-up possible. Please do your best to accommodate the student without sacrificing academic rigor.\n\nAfter a student has approached you, please:\n\n**1.** Identify work that will be missed.\n\n**2.** Do your best to find a solution to missed material.\n\n**3.** Communicate your decision clearly to the student. When a student has approached you at the beginning of a semester regarding conflicts, it is your responsibility to communicate your decision on missed work before the end of the drop/add period.\n\nPlease note that if a student is involved in a winter or spring season sport, they may not be aware of scheduling conflicts until the semester or term is underway. Again, it is the student's responsibility to approach you as soon as his or her schedule is set to make arrangements regarding missed work, and it is your responsibility to communicate in a timely manner your decision on how to handle the missed work.\n\nAdditionally, at the beginning of the semester, you are encouraged to make students aware of any important class activities that will fall outside the normal class schedule of Monday-Friday 8 a.m.-4:15 p.m. and Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday 7:30-10:25 p.m.\n\n_**Note**_ that missing a regularly scheduled class for a practice in no way constitutes an explained absence and is not expected or mandated by coaching faculty.\n\n_**To the Student:**_\n\nYou should be given a list of dates and times of scheduled games by your coach no later than the first day of classes in any term or semester in which you are involved in a varsity/junior varsity sport, or in the case of winter or spring season sports, by whichever comes first, the first preseason meeting or the first day of practice (November 1 for winter, February 15 for spring). Compare each class schedule with your schedule of games. For any course in which you see a potential conflict between academic and athletic schedules, it is your responsibility to contact the professor during the first week of class, or as soon as the scheduling conflicts are known (for example, in the case of winter season sports that begin late in the fall term) and:\n\n**1.** Identify times of conflict.\n\n**2.** Together arrive at an understanding of how missed work/class might be made up.\n\n_**Please note:**_\n\n**1.** Professors will do their best to accommodate your needs within reason.\n\n**2.** The professor will make the final decision as to how the missed work is to be made up. In cases where you approach the professor at the beginning of term, it is the professor's responsibility to arrive at this decision in time for you to drop/add if her/his decision is unsatisfactory to you. There are some cases for which there may be no satisfactory makeup possible.\n\n**3.** Conflicts with official practices are also possible in the case of special class events, such as a guest lecturer. In such cases, you should discuss the situation with both your professor and your coach, and make a decision with full understanding of the ramifications of your decision.\n\n**4.** Conflicts should be resolved through discussions between yourself, your professor, and your coach. If there are difficulties, you may consult with your Commons dean.\n\n_**Note**_ that missing a regularly scheduled class for a practice in no way constitutes an explained absence and is not expected or mandated by coaching faculty.\n\n_**To the Coach:**_\n\nPlease read the statements for the students and the professors on the preceding sections and note your role in this process. We ask you to:\n\n**1.** On or before the first day of each semester, or at the start of the season, give each student on the team you coach the list of contests that conflict with the normal 8 a.m.-4:15 p.m. Monday-Friday and Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday 7:30-10:25 p.m. class hours.\n\n**2.** Remind students that it is their responsibility to contact each of their professors and identify potential time/work conflicts.\n\n**3.** Explain to the students that there may be times when a practice needs to be missed for special class events (such as a guest lecturer). In such cases, the student should inform you of the potential conflict and discuss it with both you and the professor. It is important that students be able to make such decisions concerning conflicts with full information as to the ramifications of their decisions.\n\n**4.** There will be times when it is in the best interest of the student to attend class rather than a game, and we encourage you to support the student in such a case.\n\nWe believe that your role as a coach is very important. Students often look more to their coaches than to their professors for guidance on these issues. It is important that you understand the College policy and do your best to help resolve conflicts between these two very important, but sometimes competing, aspects of students' lives at Middlebury.\n\n_**To the Captains:**_\n\nAs a team leader, you should encourage your team members to meet with professors to discuss possible scheduling conflicts. Please ensure that your team members are aware of these guidelines on explained absences and understand that the process is one of negotiation among the coach, student, and professor.\n","excerpt":"A.

Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays or by special permission of the Athletic Policy Committee and the dean of the College. No intercollegiate athletic contests will be scheduled for Monday evenings. Refer to Chapter 3, Section VI. G. Attendance of this Handbook for the \"Guidelines for Explained Absences\" revised and approved by the Athletic Policy Committee in January 2002.</p>\n<p><strong>b.</strong> The Athletic Policy Committee encourages the scheduling of <em>JV</em> athletic contests for Saturdays.</p>\n<p><strong>c.</strong> The total number of <em>B or JV</em> athletic contests and the number of away games are subject to continual review by the Athletic Policy Committee.</p>\n<p><strong>d.</strong> Throughout the college year, those days following the end of formal classes but before the beginning of the formal examination period, will be considered as class time for purposes of scheduling intercollegiate athletic competitions. No regular-season athletic events may be scheduled during the examination period.</p>\n<p><strong>e.</strong> All candidates for athletic teams must be given a physical screening at the beginning of each season, and no candidate may be a member of any team without a certificate of his or her physical qualifications.</p>\n<p><strong>f.</strong> The College does not assume legal responsibility for the expense in caring for injuries sustained by athletes while training for or participating in athletic competition or intramural activities.</p>\n<p><strong>B. Guidelines for Handling Athletics-Explained Absences</strong></p>\n<p>The list of scheduled athletics contests you receive several times a year from the director of Athletics has been approved by the Athletic Policy Committee of the faculty (APC) acting under guidelines set forth in the <em><a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/governance/Faculty_Councils_and_Committees#athletic-policy\">Middlebury College Handbook</a>.</em> This list tells you when legitimate absences from class may be expected by students because they are involved in a sanctioned athletic event scheduled for that date. The APC regards these lists as informative. They are an <em>explanation</em> for an absence, but they do not imply that the student is excused from the obligations of a course or the class work missed.</p>\n<p>Although faculty members are expected to make their policy on course attendance clear at the beginning of each course, it is the individual student's responsibility to consult with his or her instructor as to the effect of explained absences.</p>\n<p><em><strong>To the Professor:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Please read the guidelines for students and coaches in the following sections regarding \"Explained Absences.\" Note that it is the student's responsibility to approach you in the first week of the course to identify possible conflicts between their athletics schedule and your course. However, it would be helpful if you, during the first week of classes, remind students of their obligation.</p>\n<p>How you handle missed work is entirely up to you. However, it is the College's policy that athletics are an important part of a student's life at Middlebury. There are a number of possible solutions to missed work. For example, if a lab or discussion is missed, the student may be able to attend a different section meeting. If a paper is due, ask that the paper to be handed in prior to the student's leaving. If a lecture is to be missed, you may permit the student to record the lecture (with assistance from another student). We do recognize, however, that there are cases for which there is no satisfactory make-up possible. Please do your best to accommodate the student without sacrificing academic rigor.</p>\n<p>After a student has approached you, please:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Identify work that will be missed.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Do your best to find a solution to missed material.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Communicate your decision clearly to the student. When a student has approached you at the beginning of a semester regarding conflicts, it is your responsibility to communicate your decision on missed work before the end of the drop/add period.</p>\n<p>Please note that if a student is involved in a winter or spring season sport, they may not be aware of scheduling conflicts until the semester or term is underway. Again, it is the student's responsibility to approach you as soon as his or her schedule is set to make arrangements regarding missed work, and it is your responsibility to communicate in a timely manner your decision on how to handle the missed work.</p>\n<p>Additionally, at the beginning of the semester, you are encouraged to make students aware of any important class activities that will fall outside the normal class schedule of Monday-Friday 8 a.m.-4:15 p.m. and Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday 7:30-10:25 p.m.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em> that missing a regularly scheduled class for a practice in no way constitutes an explained absence and is not expected or mandated by coaching faculty.</p>\n<p><em><strong>To the Student:</strong></em></p>\n<p>You should be given a list of dates and times of scheduled games by your coach no later than the first day of classes in any term or semester in which you are involved in a varsity/junior varsity sport, or in the case of winter or spring season sports, by whichever comes first, the first preseason meeting or the first day of practice (November 1 for winter, February 15 for spring). Compare each class schedule with your schedule of games. For any course in which you see a potential conflict between academic and athletic schedules, it is your responsibility to contact the professor during the first week of class, or as soon as the scheduling conflicts are known (for example, in the case of winter season sports that begin late in the fall term) and:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Identify times of conflict.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Together arrive at an understanding of how missed work/class might be made up.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Please note:</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Professors will do their best to accommodate your needs within reason.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> The professor will make the final decision as to how the missed work is to be made up. In cases where you approach the professor at the beginning of term, it is the professor's responsibility to arrive at this decision in time for you to drop/add if her/his decision is unsatisfactory to you. There are some cases for which there may be no satisfactory makeup possible.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Conflicts with official practices are also possible in the case of special class events, such as a guest lecturer. In such cases, you should discuss the situation with both your professor and your coach, and make a decision with full understanding of the ramifications of your decision.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Conflicts should be resolved through discussions between yourself, your professor, and your coach. If there are difficulties, you may consult with your Commons dean.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em> that missing a regularly scheduled class for a practice in no way constitutes an explained absence and is not expected or mandated by coaching faculty.</p>\n<p><em><strong>To the Coach:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Please read the statements for the students and the professors on the preceding sections and note your role in this process. We ask you to:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> On or before the first day of each semester, or at the start of the season, give each student on the team you coach the list of contests that conflict with the normal 8 a.m.-4:15 p.m. Monday-Friday and Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday 7:30-10:25 p.m. class hours.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Remind students that it is their responsibility to contact each of their professors and identify potential time/work conflicts.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Explain to the students that there may be times when a practice needs to be missed for special class events (such as a guest lecturer). In such cases, the student should inform you of the potential conflict and discuss it with both you and the professor. It is important that students be able to make such decisions concerning conflicts with full information as to the ramifications of their decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> There will be times when it is in the best interest of the student to attend class rather than a game, and we encourage you to support the student in such a case.</p>\n<p>We believe that your role as a coach is very important. Students often look more to their coaches than to their professors for guidance on these issues. It is important that you understand the College policy and do your best to help resolve conflicts between these two very important, but sometimes competing, aspects of students' lives at Middlebury.</p>\n<p><em><strong>To the Captains:</strong></em></p>\n<p>As a team leader, you should encourage your team members to meet with professors to discuss possible scheduling conflicts. Please ensure that your team members are aware of these guidelines on explained absences and understand that the process is one of negotiation among the coach, student, and professor.</p>"},"3b830cd4-5ee4-59d4-b9ac-08ea8a147815":{"id":"3b830cd4-5ee4-59d4-b9ac-08ea8a147815","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/faculty/contract-policy","title":"C.13.

Please check with the dean for faculty development and research, or the Office of Grants and Sponsored Programs if you have questions regarding administrative policies or procedures.\n\n**1\\.** The vice president for academic affairs (VPAA), and the dean for faculty development and research (DFDR), have overall responsibility for applications requesting funds from government agencies, foundations, corporations, and other sources. Day-to-day responsibilities are delegated to the Office of Grants and Sponsored Programs, which will work with faculty to assist with grant applications and the administration of funded grants and contracts. When notification of an available program comes directly to a department and the department wishes to make application for a grant, the Office of Grants and Sponsored Programs should be notified of this intent as soon as possible (not later than one month in advance of the closing date for the application). Scheduling should be coordinated with the Office of Grants and Sponsored Programs to allow two weeks for the review of draft proposals in appropriate administrative offices. Direct and indirect costs must be computed following sponsor and Middlebury policies, and, in cases for which matching funds or other commitments are required, the necessary administrative approvals must be obtained.\n\nAwards made as a result of grant or contract proposals submitted by Middlebury faculty are typically legally-binding agreements between the sponsor and Middlebury.  The faculty principal investigator or project director (PI/PD) has responsibility for carrying out the approved project on behalf of Middlebury.\n\n**2\\.** Each research or other project proposal (or preliminary proposal that include an estimated budget or commitment of academic year time or institutional resources) to an outside agency requires a Proposal Endorsement and Tracking (PET) form submitted via the online InfoEd system.  The proposal and PET form must first be approved by the chair of the department in which it originates.  In this approval the department chair certifies that the proposed project is consistent with departmental and Middlebury objectives and policy, that space and facilities for effective performance are available, and that the individual initiating the proposal and such other personnel as may be required will be available without interference with their academic duties and will be able to perform the research or other project effectively.\n\n**3\\.** Following approval by the department chair, the research or other project proposal (or preliminary proposal) must then be approved by the dean for faculty development and research. An endorsement from the provost, vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty, dean of curriculum, director of the sciences, director of the arts, director of the humanities, or the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the Schools may also be required. Modifications of the proposal as they may deem necessary or desirable will be made at this time.\n\n**4**. Under some circumstances, it may be possible to include budget lines to pay for released time in a grant application. Faculty who wish to do so must consult with the department chair and dean of curriculum early in the grant conceptualization and writing process so the dean may assess the impact of a reduced teaching load  on department and college curriculum. The primary factors in deciding whether or not to allow inclusion of requests for released time in grant applications are the ability of the department to find a replacement if a replacement is authorized and/or the impact of losing a course in the department/college curriculum. The following guidelines apply:\n\n**a.** Winter term course releases are often the easiest for a department to absorb and replace, and should therefore be given primary consideration.\n\n**b.** Having a grant-funded teaching reduction does not reduce obligations in advising, committee service, or chairing departments and programs.\n\n**c.** In order to ensure continuity in the curriculum and equity in course loads, no more than three years out of a five-year period may include grant-funded released time for a given faculty member.\n\n**d.** It is expected that faculty with grant-funded released time will mentor more research students. Wherever possible, funds to pay for student research assistants should be built into grant budgets.\n\n**e.** Faculty compensation for the purpose of the proposal is computed at 18% of the faculty member’s annual salary per course release, plus benefits.\n\n**5\\.** Applications approved by the aforementioned officers must be reviewed by the Office of Grants and Sponsored Programs to ensure compliance with Middlebury and federal government (or other sponsor) requirements. The following guidelines apply:\n\n**a.** Project applications incorporating provisions for extra pay for research or other project work normally will be approved to provide for up to two months of extra work during the summer. One month's summer salary is equal to 1/9th of the annual contract salary for the prior academic year.  Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the VPAA/DOF, upon recommendation of the DFDR.\n\n**b.** The budget incorporated in the project application must include applicable indirect (F&A) costs at Middlebury’s federally-approved indirect cost rate unless the sponsor or solicitation otherwise limits them.  Exceptions to this policy must be approved in advance by the VPAA/DOF.\n\n**c.** All direct costs comprehensively defined will be reflected in the budget incorporated in the project application. When faculty apply for outside funding to support academic leaves, the level of support from the College is understood to be 75 percent of stated salary for a semester leave and 55 percent of stated salary for a year's leave.\n\n**d.** The adequacy of provisions in the proposed budget for equipment, building alterations, power consumption, etc., must be reviewed by the Office of Grants & Sponsored Programs  in consultation with the director of budget and financial planning, the director of Facilities Services, and/or other appropriate officials as applicable. and the chair of the department originating the proposal; Provisions for salaries must be made in consultation with the office of the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty, and/or director of Human Resources, as appropriate. All applications in which support is requested for the purchase of computers or software or central technology needs must be approved by the associate vice president for Information Technology or designate.\n\n**e.** If the application calls for a cost share to be provided by the institution, the Proposal Endorsement and Tracking (PET) form must include the Middlebury budget from which these funds will come and an authorizing approval.\n\n**f**. If the application calls for purchase of equipment requiring maintenance after a warranty period, there must be a budget to be charged for maintenance.\n\n**g.** All grant proposals must disclose any family relationship between any individuals named in the proposal using the [Family Relationship Disclosure Form](https://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/129901/original/Famrel_Jan07_form.doc). No family members may be paid with grant funds unless that relationship was disclosed in the proposal or disclosed to the controller or designee after receipt of a grant award.\n\n**h.** Any “Significant Financial Interest” (as defined by Federal and [Middlebury policy](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/support/grants/sro/policies/COI/coifull)) must be disclosed to the controller at the time of submission. After a grant is funded, significant financial interests must be disclosed at least annually and at any time such a new interest arises.   In lieu of the aforementioned requirement, proposals to and grants awarded by any Public Health Service entity including the National Institutes of Health are governed by the [PHS/NIH Financial Conflict of Interest Policy](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/support/grants/sro/policies/phs-fcoi) posted on the Middlebury website.\n\n**i.** When applicable, the application and/or cover letter must state that payment of the contract or grant be directed to the controller and disbursements from it made under his or her direction. All accounting and financial reports will be handled by the Office of the Controller (or designate),\n\n**6\\.**  Designated members of the Office of Grants and  Sponsored Programs staff are authorized to sign all grant applications on behalf of Middlebury  when they are  satisfied that all the above conditions have been met. A copy of the complete proposal must be provided to the Office of Grants and Sponsored Programs.\n\nContract or Grant Agreements resulting from submitted applications must be reviewed and negotiated by the Office of Grants and Sponsored Programs and executed in accordance with [the Policy on Contracting for Middlebury.](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/administration/vpfin/finance-office/bsnsvcs/contracting/policies/contracting-policy)\n\n**7\\.** Upon receipt of contract or grant funds in response to an application approved and executed as set forth above, all procedures then in effect for disbursement of Middlebury funds from the regular Middlebury budget will apply. Middlebury must be at least as scrupulous in handling external funds as in handling its own funds, and in some instances will be called upon to observe even more meticulous requirements.   The project director/principal investigator (PD/PI)  will be the budget administrator for the grant and contract, responsible for adhering to the grant budget and these Middlebury policies and procedures.\n\nCommitments to pay for additional personnel must be cleared with Human Resources before such commitments are made. All purchases must comply with Middlebury purchasing and payment policies and procedures in advance of making the purchase commitments. Determination of whether or not proposed purchases or other charges are allowable under the terms of a grant or contract will be made by the Controller or his/her designate, who may require the prior approval of the sponsoring organization.\n\n**8\\.** Middlebury has a primary responsibility for the scholarly needs of its faculty. Middlebury also recognizes its concern for the continued scholarly productivity of faculty departing for other institutions.\n\nWhen a departing faculty member requests release of certain research equipment brought to Middlebury through an investigator-initiated research grant, Middlebury will consider release of equipment to the other institution concerned on an individual basis and if:\n\n**a.** The equipment is critical to the investigator's research, and\n\n**b.** It will not or cannot be supplied by the institution to which he or she is going, and\n\n**c.** It is not critical to faculty research at Middlebury, and\n\n**d.** The conditions under which the equipment or funds used to purchase it were secured do not preclude disposition. \"Critical\" equipment is defined as equipment essential to research personally conducted or directed by the faculty member. The individual requesting the equipment has the responsibility for demonstrating to Middlebury his or her need for that equipment for the continuation of his or her personal research.\n\n_rev. 8/16/19_\n","excerpt":"Please note: In light of ongoing changes in federal regulations and administrative structure, this section may be revised periodically…","html":"<p><strong><em>Please note:</em></strong> In light of ongoing changes in federal regulations and administrative structure, this section may be revised periodically.

One month's summer salary is equal to 1/9th of the annual contract salary for the prior academic year.  Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the VPAA/DOF, upon recommendation of the DFDR.</p>\n<p><strong>b.</strong> The budget incorporated in the project application must include applicable indirect (F&#x26;A) costs at Middlebury’s federally-approved indirect cost rate unless the sponsor or solicitation otherwise limits them.  Exceptions to this policy must be approved in advance by the VPAA/DOF.</p>\n<p><strong>c.</strong> All direct costs comprehensively defined will be reflected in the budget incorporated in the project application. When faculty apply for outside funding to support academic leaves, the level of support from the College is understood to be 75 percent of stated salary for a semester leave and 55 percent of stated salary for a year's leave.</p>\n<p><strong>d.</strong> The adequacy of provisions in the proposed budget for equipment, building alterations, power consumption, etc., must be reviewed by the Office of Grants &#x26; Sponsored Programs  in consultation with the director of budget and financial planning, the director of Facilities Services, and/or other appropriate officials as applicable. and the chair of the department originating the proposal; Provisions for salaries must be made in consultation with the office of the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty, and/or director of Human Resources, as appropriate. All applications in which support is requested for the purchase of computers or software or central technology needs must be approved by the associate vice president for Information Technology or designate.</p>\n<p><strong>e.</strong> If the application calls for a cost share to be provided by the institution, the Proposal Endorsement and Tracking (PET) form must include the Middlebury budget from which these funds will come and an authorizing approval.</p>\n<p><strong>f</strong>. If the application calls for purchase of equipment requiring maintenance after a warranty period, there must be a budget to be charged for maintenance.</p>\n<p><strong>g.</strong> All grant proposals must disclose any family relationship between any individuals named in the proposal using the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/129901/original/Famrel_Jan07_form.doc\">Family Relationship Disclosure Form</a>. No family members may be paid with grant funds unless that relationship was disclosed in the proposal or disclosed to the controller or designee after receipt of a grant award.</p>\n<p><strong>h.</strong> Any “Significant Financial Interest” (as defined by Federal and <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/support/grants/sro/policies/COI/coifull\">Middlebury policy</a>) must be disclosed to the controller at the time of submission. After a grant is funded, significant financial interests must be disclosed at least annually and at any time such a new interest arises.   In lieu of the aforementioned requirement, proposals to and grants awarded by any Public Health Service entity including the National Institutes of Health are governed by the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/support/grants/sro/policies/phs-fcoi\">PHS/NIH Financial Conflict of Interest Policy</a> posted on the Middlebury website.</p>\n<p><strong>i.</strong> When applicable, the application and/or cover letter must state that payment of the contract or grant be directed to the controller and disbursements from it made under his or her direction. All accounting and financial reports will be handled by the Office of the Controller (or designate),</p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong>  Designated members of the Office of Grants and  Sponsored Programs staff are authorized to sign all grant applications on behalf of Middlebury  when they are  satisfied that all the above conditions have been met. A copy of the complete proposal must be provided to the Office of Grants and Sponsored Programs.</p>\n<p>Contract or Grant Agreements resulting from submitted applications must be reviewed and negotiated by the Office of Grants and Sponsored Programs and executed in accordance with <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/administration/vpfin/finance-office/bsnsvcs/contracting/policies/contracting-policy\">the Policy on Contracting for Middlebury.</a></p>\n<p><strong>7.</strong> Upon receipt of contract or grant funds in response to an application approved and executed as set forth above, all procedures then in effect for disbursement of Middlebury funds from the regular Middlebury budget will apply. Middlebury must be at least as scrupulous in handling external funds as in handling its own funds, and in some instances will be called upon to observe even more meticulous requirements.   The project director/principal investigator (PD/PI)  will be the budget administrator for the grant and contract, responsible for adhering to the grant budget and these Middlebury policies and procedures.</p>\n<p>Commitments to pay for additional personnel must be cleared with Human Resources before such commitments are made. All purchases must comply with Middlebury purchasing and payment policies and procedures in advance of making the purchase commitments. Determination of whether or not proposed purchases or other charges are allowable under the terms of a grant or contract will be made by the Controller or his/her designate, who may require the prior approval of the sponsoring organization.</p>\n<p><strong>8.</strong> Middlebury has a primary responsibility for the scholarly needs of its faculty. Middlebury also recognizes its concern for the continued scholarly productivity of faculty departing for other institutions.</p>\n<p>When a departing faculty member requests release of certain research equipment brought to Middlebury through an investigator-initiated research grant, Middlebury will consider release of equipment to the other institution concerned on an individual basis and if:</p>\n<p><strong>a.</strong> The equipment is critical to the investigator's research, and</p>\n<p><strong>b.</strong> It will not or cannot be supplied by the institution to which he or she is going, and</p>\n<p><strong>c.</strong> It is not critical to faculty research at Middlebury, and</p>\n<p><strong>d.</strong> The conditions under which the equipment or funds used to purchase it were secured do not preclude disposition. \"Critical\" equipment is defined as equipment essential to research personally conducted or directed by the faculty member. The individual requesting the equipment has the responsibility for demonstrating to Middlebury his or her need for that equipment for the continuation of his or her personal research.</p>\n<p><em>rev. 8/16/19</em></p>"},"837a7f61-34da-52f6-bca2-4facf0ee6c4a":{"id":"837a7f61-34da-52f6-bca2-4facf0ee6c4a","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/faculty/faculty-development","title":"C.8.

Vacancies occurring because of leaves or termination of employment should, when possible, be filled at an appropriate time in the academic year preceding leave or termination of employment.</p>\n<p>viii. All councils and committees with the exception of the Council on Reviews, the Educational Affairs Committee, the Faculty Council, the Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, the Strategy Committee, the Resources Committee, and the Appeals Council, may have student members. Student members will be chosen as determined by the Community Council. The number of students, if any, for each committee, and the condition of membership, whether voting or non-voting, will be set by the faculty. No later than the March plenary session of the faculty, the Faculty Council, in its role as the Committee on Committees, will make recommendations regarding changes in composition and function of any committee for the following academic year.</p>\n<p><strong>6.

Leaves of Absence (nonacademic)","body":"\nLeaves for the purpose of research are described in a separate [section](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/faculty/leave-program).\n\n**Leaves of Absence and Leave Pay Options (nonacademic)**\n\nDuring the course of their careers, faculty members may need extended time off for reasons such as a new baby, to care for an ailing family member, for one’s own medical condition, or for personal reasons. Middlebury provides a number of generous paid leave options - as well as unpaid options -to support benefits-eligible faculty during such life events. As described below, special income benefits are available for new parents (paid parental time) and for faculty members prevented from working by illness or injury (short-term disability and long-term disability). In addition, faculty accrue Faculty Leave Reserve (FLR) which can be used for a variety of purposes such as to provide pay when a leave is needed to care for a family member or to supplement partial pay received under one of the special paid leave benefits.\n\n_Notes:_\n\n_Any faculty member on ongoing appointment is eligible to apply for leave in order to meet familial responsibilities. Normally, only one year of familial leave will be allowed outside the regular scheduling of reviews for reappointment, promotion, and tenure. The College will do its best to honor leave requests, but it is incumbent upon the individual wishing such a leave to apply early enough so that the department affected may have time to plan for a replacement or make other arrangements to cover classes._\n\n_When reviewing this section of the handbook it is important to keep in mind the distinction between a leave of absence and pay. A leave of absence is simply approval to be relieved of work duties for a period of time and is, by default, unpaid time. However, Middlebury offers a number of benefits that can be used to provide a faculty member with pay during an approved leave of absence. Therefore there is a two-part determination when a faculty member requests paid time off. First, a decision by the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty (VPAA/DoF) as to whether (and to what extent) the individual is entitled to be released from work, and second a decision – which, depending on the benefit under consideration can fall under the purview of the VPAA/DoF, Human Resources, or Middlebury’s insurance carrier - as to whether the faculty member is entitled to pay and/or continuation of benefits while relieved of duties._\n\n**Family and Medical Leave Act**\n\nThe federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and similar state leave laws entitle eligible faculty members to unpaid leaves of absence for: the foster placement, birth or adoption of a child; care of self or certain family member(s) with a serious health condition; certain exigencies arising from a family member’s call to active military duty; or to care for a family member injured while on active military duty. (See the [Employee Benefits chapter in the *Middlebury Handbook* ](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/time-away/family-medical-leave)or contact Human Resources for more information.) While the federal law provides for a period of unpaid, job-protected leave, as explained below Middlebury has several benefit programs and policies that provide for pay during certain FMLA-qualifying leaves.\n\n**Faculty Leave Reserve (FLR) Pay**\n\nEffective July 1, 2017 each benefits-eligible faculty member has a Faculty Leave Reserve (FLR) account; accrued FLR hours can be accessed to provide paid time off for a variety of needs.  Faculty accrue 1.54 hours of FLR time each pay period, which results in the addition of one week (40 hours) of FLR time per year of full-time work (accruals are pro-rated for part-time work, except that during FMLA leaves and sabbaticals accruals are not reduced.)  *Faculty members hired prior to July 1, 2017 were credited with a beginning balance of one week of FLR for each week of full-time service up to that date.*\n\nAccrued FLR can be used for any of the following reasons:\n\n- Pre- and post-parental-leave portion of semesters for new parents, should they wish to remain fully on leave instead of resuming non-teaching responsibilities.\n- To augment the 60% pay received from either the short-term or long-term disability benefit plans and thus remain at full salary.\n- Pre- or post-disability portions of semesters when a faculty member has no active disability, arrangements are in place for someone else to cover teaching, and full-time nonteaching duties are not available.\n- Any sort of family leave that would qualify as FMLA time.\n- Any reason that would qualify under the Vermont Earned Sick Time<sup>1</sup> law.\n\nFaculty members wishing to use FLR pay will coordinate the request for time off with the VPAA/DoF and then work with Disability/Leave Specialist in Human Resources who will adjust the FLR balances to reflect time used.  Faculty members with five or fewer years of service may be allowed, at the discretion of the VPAA/DoF, to go into a negative FLR balance should needs arise that otherwise qualify for FLR but for which a sufficient balance has not accrued.  In no event will the new faculty member be able to have a negative balance of more than 200 hours.\n\nFaculty members out on leave who have exhausted their FLR balances (except for certain new faculty, as described above) will be unpaid unless they qualify for short-term or long-term disability, in which case they will be partially paid, typically at 60% of their base salary.\n\nAt <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">retirement</span> any accrued, unused FLR time will convert to College-paid medical and dental coverage, as described in the Middlebury College Health and Welfare Summary Plan Description.  There is no option to cash-out FLR under any circumstances or to use it for any purpose not specifically covered by the policy.\n\n_<sup>1</sup>The Faculty Leave Reserve Policy complies with the Vermont Earned Sick Leave Law, 21 V.S.A.&& 481-486 which requires limited paid time away from work for: physical or mental illness, preventative care, or to arrange services related to domestic violence or sexual assault.  Time can be for the employee’s own need or the needs of: a parent, spouse, child, sibling, parent-in-law, grandchild or foster child._\n\n**Parental Leaves/Parental Pay**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nMiddlebury recognizes the critical importance of bonding time during the period following the birth or adoption of a child. While the federal Family and Medical Leave Act guarantees up to 12 weeks of leave, FMLA is unpaid.  In order to provide financial support for faculty members who are welcoming new children to their families Middlebury has several options for paid time, which can be used in conjunction with FMLA time.  Available options include: Paid Parental Time, Faculty Leave Reserve, course releases, and – for birth mothers - Short-Term Disability Pay.\n\n**Paid Parental Time Eligibility**\n\nPaid Parental Time is available to benefits-eligible faculty members while serving as the primary caregiver for a period of time during the first 12 months following the birth or adoption of a child. The definition of ‘primary care-giver’ will vary across family situations, but typically means that throughout the period of Paid Parental Time the parent has principal responsibility for the child for a significant portion of each work day during the work week. In the case of adoptions the benefit applies only when the child being adopted is less than 18 years of age.\n\n**Paid Parental Time Benefit**\n\nThe amount and timing of Faculty Paid Parental Time will vary depending on whether or not the individual applying for the benefit is scheduled to teach during the leave/pay period and whether or not both parents are employees of Middlebury College. The most common scenarios are described below.  When situations arise which do not fall into one of these categories, and when unexpected complexities arise, VPAA/DoF, in their sole discretion, will decide to what extent to adapt the Paid Parental Time benefit.\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Primary Caregiver Scheduled to Teach</span>**\n\nWhen a child is expected to be born or adopted during a semester in which the parent is scheduled to teach, the faculty member will be relieved of **_teaching_** duties for the entire semester. Specifically:\n\nWhen the parent/faculty member is **not** also the birth mother:\n\n- During the first 6 weeks post-birth/adoption a faculty member who is not also a birth mother will not be expected to perform **_any_** duties, and will receive full salary.\n- For the remainder of the semester the faculty member can elect to:\n\n1.  Continue or resume non-teaching duties such as committee work, administrative work, academic advising, and supervision of senior work, in which case he or she will continue to receive full pay, OR\n2.  If the faculty member is eligible under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) he or she can elect to continue leave with no duties generally for up to an additional 6 weeks (contact Human Resources for details), in which case he or she can:\n\na)    Use accrued Faculty Leave Reserve to maintain pay, OR\n\nb)    Be placed on unpaid leave with benefits.\n\nWhen the parent/faculty member **is** the birth mother:\n\n- During the post-birth period the birth mother is eligible for 6 weeks Paid Parental Time (paid at 100% pay) PLUS a period (typically 4 to 6 weeks) of Short-term Disability Pay (at 60% pay) during which time she will not be expected to perform **_any_** duties. A faculty member can opt to “supplement” the 60% STD pay with accrued FLR pay to receive up to full salary during the disability portion of the leave.\n- For the remainder of the semester the faculty member can elect to:\n\n1.  Continue or resume non-teaching duties such as committee work, administrative work, academic advising, and supervision of senior work, in which case he or she will continue to receive full pay, OR\n2.  If the faculty member is eligible under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) he or she can elect to continue leave with no duties generally for up to an additional 6 weeks (contact Human Resources for details), in which case he or she can:\n\na)    Use accrued Faculty Leave Reserve to maintain pay, OR\n\nb)    Be placed on unpaid leave with benefits.\n\nThe following guidelines should be used to determine which semester(s) faculty may be released from teaching duties in the event of a birth or adoption under the policy for faculty scheduled to teach:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"258\">\n\n**For birth or adoption that is expected to occur:**\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"241\">\n\n**Semester(s) released from teaching:**\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"258\">\n\nOctober 1 - November 30\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"241\">\n\nFall & Winter Term\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"258\">\n\nDecember 1 – January 31\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"241\">\n\nWinter Term & Spring\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"258\">\n\nFebruary 1 – May 15\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"241\">\n\nSpring\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"258\">\n\nMay 16 – September 30\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"241\">\n\nFall\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n</div>\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Primary Caregiver NOT Scheduled to Teach</span>**\n\nIf the faculty member is not scheduled to teach by reason of academic leave, administrative appointment, or other reason, he or she will be eligible for up to 6 weeks of Paid Parental Time after the birth or adoption, assuming he or she will be the primary caregiver during this period.  If the faculty member is eligible under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) he or she can elect to _continue leave with_ _no_ _duties_ generally for up to an additional 6 weeks (contact Human Resources for details), in which case he or she would be placed on unpaid leave with benefits, OR can opt to use Faculty Leave Reserve to maintain paid status.  Birth mothers will also be eligible for an additional period of Short-Term Disability pay.\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Both Parents Employed by Middlebury College</span>**\n\n**Two-Faculty Couples:** In situations in which both parents are Middlebury faculty, and both are eligible under the College’s Paid Parental Time policy, the faculty members will allocate between themselves, in consultation with the VPAA/DoA, a maximum of <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">12</span> weeks of Paid Parental Time. This means, in situations in which one parent receives a full-semester of paid leave, the other parent will _not_ be eligible for Paid Parental Time. However, in this case the parent receiving the full semester leave will not be expected to resume non-teaching duties after 6 weeks or use Faculty Leave Reserve; instead he or she will receive a full 12 weeks of Paid Parental Time with full work release.\n\nIn cases where neither parent is receiving the full semester leave (because of academic leaves and/or administrative appointments, for example), each may take up to 6 weeks of full Paid Parental Time, with no duties required. The timing of the leave for the first parent to take a leave will obviously be tied to the date of the birth or adoption of the child.  However, the timing of the Paid Parental Time (if any) for the second parent/employee is at the discretion of the VPAA/DoA, and would generally be timed so as not to disrupt a full academic semester. (Many secondary Paid Parental Time leaves will be granted during J-Term, for example.) As an alternative, the second Faculty parent could request a course release to be used within 12 months of the birth/adoption.  Approval of a course release would be at the discretion of the VPAA/DoA.\n\n_In either case the birth mother will also be eligible for an additional period of paid Short-Term Disability pay._\n\n**Faculty/Staff Couples:** In situations where one parent is a member of the faculty and the other of the staff there are several possible scenarios for the Faculty parent:\n\n- <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Faculty Parent who is scheduled to teach takes the initial leave:</span>  A faculty member who is scheduled to teach during the semester in which the new child arrives/is scheduled to arrive will be eligible for a teaching release and pay as described in the _“Primary Caregiver Scheduled to Teach”_ section, above.\n- <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Faculty Parent who is NOT scheduled to teach takes the initial leave:</span>  A faculty member who is not scheduled to teach by reason of academic leave, administrative appointment, or other reason, and who will be the initial primary caregiver will be eligible for up to 6 weeks of Paid Parental Time immediately after the birth or adoption. If the parent is also the birth mother she will be eligible for an additional period of Short-Term Disability pay.\n- <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Faculty Parent who takes a leave after the staff parent has used Staff Paid Parental Leave:</span>  When the staff parent takes parental leave first, a faculty spouse/partner (who subsequently qualifies as the primary caregiver) may take up to 6 weeks of fully paid parental leave, with no duties required*.* However, the timing of this Paid Parental Time leave is at the discretion of the VPAA/DoA, and would generally be timed so as not to disrupt a full academic semester—during J-term, for example. As an alternative, the Faculty parent could request a course release to be used within 12 months of the birth/adoption. Approval of a course release would be at the discretion of the VPAA/DoA.\n\n_In all cases a faculty member qualifying under the FMLA or similar state law is entitled to up to 12 weeks of leave within a year of the birth/adoption. Such leave can be a combination of Paid Parental Time, Short-Term Disability pay, FLR, course release time, or unpaid time._\n\n**Adoptive families**\n\nRecognizing that it can be very difficult to predict precisely when placement of a child  will occur the VPAA/DoF will work closely with faculty who are adoptive parents to apply the provisions of this policy to their particular circumstances. Generally speaking, faculty who have not made previous arrangements for work release under this policy but receive their child within  semester during which they are teaching , can elect to be relieved of all non-teaching duties immediately upon the arrival of the child, provided they qualify as primary caregiver.  In these cases, the faculty member would be granted Paid Parental Time in the subsequent semester, under the terms described above.  *In all cases a faculty member qualifying for FMLA leave is immediately entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave, and may use accrued FLR, in addition to the Paid Parental Time described above.*\n\n**Effect of Leave on Tenure Review Schedule**\n\nIf a faculty member in a regular appointment is released from teaching for a parental leave under this policy, that faculty member's review schedule will be postponed by one semester, unless the faculty member requests that the schedule not be so postponed.\n\n**Other Unpaid Leaves**\n\nFaculty members on ongoing appointments are eligible to apply for leave for personal reasons. Such leaves are without pay and benefits and will usually last for a minimum of one semester and a maximum of one year. Normally, only one year of personal leave will be outside the regular scheduling of reviews for reappointment, promotion, and tenure.\n\nThe College will do its best to honor such requests, but it is incumbent upon the individual wishing such a leave to apply early enough so that the department affected may have time to plan for a replacement or make alternative arrangements for covering classes.\n\n**Vermont Earned Sick Time (VEST) for <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Non-regular</span> Faculty**\n\nFaculty members who are otherwise classified as <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">non-benefits-eligible</span> are provided with a paid time off benefit under the Vermont Earned Sick Leave Law, 21 V.S.A.&& 481-486.  VEST allows for certain paid time away from work for: physical or mental illness, preventative care, or to arrange services related to domestic violence or sexual assault.  Time can be for the employee’s own need or the needs of: a parent, spouse, child, sibling, parent-in-law, grandchild or foster child.  See the [VEST Policy in the Middlebury Handbook](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/time-away/4-14-vermont-earned-sick-time) for details.\n","excerpt":"Leaves for the purpose of research are described in a separate section.

(See the <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/time-away/family-medical-leave\">Employee Benefits chapter in the <em>Middlebury Handbook</em> </a>or contact Human Resources for more information.) While the federal law provides for a period of unpaid, job-protected leave, as explained below Middlebury has several benefit programs and policies that provide for pay during certain FMLA-qualifying leaves.</p>\n<p><strong>Faculty Leave Reserve (FLR) Pay</strong></p>\n<p>Effective July 1, 2017 each benefits-eligible faculty member has a Faculty Leave Reserve (FLR) account; accrued FLR hours can be accessed to provide paid time off for a variety of needs.  Faculty accrue 1.54 hours of FLR time each pay period, which results in the addition of one week (40 hours) of FLR time per year of full-time work (accruals are pro-rated for part-time work, except that during FMLA leaves and sabbaticals accruals are not reduced.)  <em>Faculty members hired prior to July 1, 2017 were credited with a beginning balance of one week of FLR for each week of full-time service up to that date.</em></p>\n<p>Accrued FLR can be used for any of the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pre- and post-parental-leave portion of semesters for new parents, should they wish to remain fully on leave instead of resuming non-teaching responsibilities.</li>\n<li>To augment the 60% pay received from either the short-term or long-term disability benefit plans and thus remain at full salary.</li>\n<li>Pre- or post-disability portions of semesters when a faculty member has no active disability, arrangements are in place for someone else to cover teaching, and full-time nonteaching duties are not available.</li>\n<li>Any sort of family leave that would qualify as FMLA time.</li>\n<li>Any reason that would qualify under the Vermont Earned Sick Time<sup>1</sup> law.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Faculty members wishing to use FLR pay will coordinate the request for time off with the VPAA/DoF and then work with Disability/Leave Specialist in Human Resources who will adjust the FLR balances to reflect time used.  Faculty members with five or fewer years of service may be allowed, at the discretion of the VPAA/DoF, to go into a negative FLR balance should needs arise that otherwise qualify for FLR but for which a sufficient balance has not accrued.  In no event will the new faculty member be able to have a negative balance of more than 200 hours.</p>\n<p>Faculty members out on leave who have exhausted their FLR balances (except for certain new faculty, as described above) will be unpaid unless they qualify for short-term or long-term disability, in which case they will be partially paid, typically at 60% of their base salary.</p>\n<p>At <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">retirement</span> any accrued, unused FLR time will convert to College-paid medical and dental coverage, as described in the Middlebury College Health and Welfare Summary Plan Description.  There is no option to cash-out FLR under any circumstances or to use it for any purpose not specifically covered by the policy.</p>\n<p><em><sup>1</sup>The Faculty Leave Reserve Policy complies with the Vermont Earned Sick Leave Law, 21 V.S.A.&#x26;&#x26; 481-486 which requires limited paid time away from work for: physical or mental illness, preventative care, or to arrange services related to domestic violence or sexual assault.  Time can be for the employee’s own need or the needs of: a parent, spouse, child, sibling, parent-in-law, grandchild or foster child.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Parental Leaves/Parental Pay</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury recognizes the critical importance of bonding time during the period following the birth or adoption of a child. While the federal Family and Medical Leave Act guarantees up to 12 weeks of leave, FMLA is unpaid.  In order to provide financial support for faculty members who are welcoming new children to their families Middlebury has several options for paid time, which can be used in conjunction with FMLA time.  Available options include: Paid Parental Time, Faculty Leave Reserve, course releases, and – for birth mothers - Short-Term Disability Pay.</p>\n<p><strong>Paid Parental Time Eligibility</strong></p>\n<p>Paid Parental Time is available to benefits-eligible faculty members while serving as the primary caregiver for a period of time during the first 12 months following the birth or adoption of a child. The definition of ‘primary care-giver’ will vary across family situations, but typically means that throughout the period of Paid Parental Time the parent has principal responsibility for the child for a significant portion of each work day during the work week. In the case of adoptions the benefit applies only when the child being adopted is less than 18 years of age.</p>\n<p><strong>Paid Parental Time Benefit</strong></p>\n<p>The amount and timing of Faculty Paid Parental Time will vary depending on whether or not the individual applying for the benefit is scheduled to teach during the leave/pay period and whether or not both parents are employees of Middlebury College. The most common scenarios are described below.  When situations arise which do not fall into one of these categories, and when unexpected complexities arise, VPAA/DoF, in their sole discretion, will decide to what extent to adapt the Paid Parental Time benefit.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Primary Caregiver Scheduled to Teach</span></strong></p>\n<p>When a child is expected to be born or adopted during a semester in which the parent is scheduled to teach, the faculty member will be relieved of <strong><em>teaching</em></strong> duties for the entire semester. Specifically:</p>\n<p>When the parent/faculty member is <strong>not</strong> also the birth mother:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>During the first 6 weeks post-birth/adoption a faculty member who is not also a birth mother will not be expected to perform <strong><em>any</em></strong> duties, and will receive full salary.</li>\n<li>For the remainder of the semester the faculty member can elect to:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Continue or resume non-teaching duties such as committee work, administrative work, academic advising, and supervision of senior work, in which case he or she will continue to receive full pay, OR</li>\n<li>If the faculty member is eligible under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) he or she can elect to continue leave with no duties generally for up to an additional 6 weeks (contact Human Resources for details), in which case he or she can:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>a)    Use accrued Faculty Leave Reserve to maintain pay, OR</p>\n<p>b)    Be placed on unpaid leave with benefits.</p>\n<p>When the parent/faculty member <strong>is</strong> the birth mother:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>During the post-birth period the birth mother is eligible for 6 weeks Paid Parental Time (paid at 100% pay) PLUS a period (typically 4 to 6 weeks) of Short-term Disability Pay (at 60% pay) during which time she will not be expected to perform <strong><em>any</em></strong> duties. A faculty member can opt to “supplement” the 60% STD pay with accrued FLR pay to receive up to full salary during the disability portion of the leave.</li>\n<li>For the remainder of the semester the faculty member can elect to:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Continue or resume non-teaching duties such as committee work, administrative work, academic advising, and supervision of senior work, in which case he or she will continue to receive full pay, OR</li>\n<li>If the faculty member is eligible under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) he or she can elect to continue leave with no duties generally for up to an additional 6 weeks (contact Human Resources for details), in which case he or she can:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>a)    Use accrued Faculty Leave Reserve to maintain pay, OR</p>\n<p>b)    Be placed on unpaid leave with benefits.</p>\n<p>The following guidelines should be used to determine which semester(s) faculty may be released from teaching duties in the event of a birth or adoption under the policy for faculty scheduled to teach:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"258\">\n<p><strong>For birth or adoption that is expected to occur:</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"241\">\n<p><strong>Semester(s) released from teaching:</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"258\">\n<p>October 1 - November 30</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"241\">\n<p>Fall &#x26; Winter Term</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"258\">\n<p>December 1 – January 31</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"241\">\n<p>Winter Term &#x26; Spring</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"258\">\n<p>February 1 – May 15</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"241\">\n<p>Spring</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"258\">\n<p>May 16 – September 30</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"241\">\n<p>Fall</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Primary Caregiver NOT Scheduled to Teach</span></strong></p>\n<p>If the faculty member is not scheduled to teach by reason of academic leave, administrative appointment, or other reason, he or she will be eligible for up to 6 weeks of Paid Parental Time after the birth or adoption, assuming he or she will be the primary caregiver during this period.  If the faculty member is eligible under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) he or she can elect to <em>continue leave with</em> <em>no</em> <em>duties</em> generally for up to an additional 6 weeks (contact Human Resources for details), in which case he or she would be placed on unpaid leave with benefits, OR can opt to use Faculty Leave Reserve to maintain paid status.  Birth mothers will also be eligible for an additional period of Short-Term Disability pay.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Both Parents Employed by Middlebury College</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Two-Faculty Couples:</strong> In situations in which both parents are Middlebury faculty, and both are eligible under the College’s Paid Parental Time policy, the faculty members will allocate between themselves, in consultation with the VPAA/DoA, a maximum of <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">12</span> weeks of Paid Parental Time. This means, in situations in which one parent receives a full-semester of paid leave, the other parent will <em>not</em> be eligible for Paid Parental Time. However, in this case the parent receiving the full semester leave will not be expected to resume non-teaching duties after 6 weeks or use Faculty Leave Reserve; instead he or she will receive a full 12 weeks of Paid Parental Time with full work release.</p>\n<p>In cases where neither parent is receiving the full semester leave (because of academic leaves and/or administrative appointments, for example), each may take up to 6 weeks of full Paid Parental Time, with no duties required. The timing of the leave for the first parent to take a leave will obviously be tied to the date of the birth or adoption of the child.  However, the timing of the Paid Parental Time (if any) for the second parent/employee is at the discretion of the VPAA/DoA, and would generally be timed so as not to disrupt a full academic semester. (Many secondary Paid Parental Time leaves will be granted during J-Term, for example.) As an alternative, the second Faculty parent could request a course release to be used within 12 months of the birth/adoption.  Approval of a course release would be at the discretion of the VPAA/DoA.</p>\n<p><em>In either case the birth mother will also be eligible for an additional period of paid Short-Term Disability pay.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Faculty/Staff Couples:</strong> In situations where one parent is a member of the faculty and the other of the staff there are several possible scenarios for the Faculty parent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Faculty Parent who is scheduled to teach takes the initial leave:</span>  A faculty member who is scheduled to teach during the semester in which the new child arrives/is scheduled to arrive will be eligible for a teaching release and pay as described in the <em>“Primary Caregiver Scheduled to Teach”</em> section, above.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Faculty Parent who is NOT scheduled to teach takes the initial leave:</span>  A faculty member who is not scheduled to teach by reason of academic leave, administrative appointment, or other reason, and who will be the initial primary caregiver will be eligible for up to 6 weeks of Paid Parental Time immediately after the birth or adoption. If the parent is also the birth mother she will be eligible for an additional period of Short-Term Disability pay.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Faculty Parent who takes a leave after the staff parent has used Staff Paid Parental Leave:</span>  When the staff parent takes parental leave first, a faculty spouse/partner (who subsequently qualifies as the primary caregiver) may take up to 6 weeks of fully paid parental leave, with no duties required*.* However, the timing of this Paid Parental Time leave is at the discretion of the VPAA/DoA, and would generally be timed so as not to disrupt a full academic semester—during J-term, for example. As an alternative, the Faculty parent could request a course release to be used within 12 months of the birth/adoption. Approval of a course release would be at the discretion of the VPAA/DoA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>In all cases a faculty member qualifying under the FMLA or similar state law is entitled to up to 12 weeks of leave within a year of the birth/adoption. Such leave can be a combination of Paid Parental Time, Short-Term Disability pay, FLR, course release time, or unpaid time.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Adoptive families</strong></p>\n<p>Recognizing that it can be very difficult to predict precisely when placement of a child  will occur the VPAA/DoF will work closely with faculty who are adoptive parents to apply the provisions of this policy to their particular circumstances. Generally speaking, faculty who have not made previous arrangements for work release under this policy but receive their child within  semester during which they are teaching , can elect to be relieved of all non-teaching duties immediately upon the arrival of the child, provided they qualify as primary caregiver.  In these cases, the faculty member would be granted Paid Parental Time in the subsequent semester, under the terms described above.  <em>In all cases a faculty member qualifying for FMLA leave is immediately entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave, and may use accrued FLR, in addition to the Paid Parental Time described above.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Effect of Leave on Tenure Review Schedule</strong></p>\n<p>If a faculty member in a regular appointment is released from teaching for a parental leave under this policy, that faculty member's review schedule will be postponed by one semester, unless the faculty member requests that the schedule not be so postponed.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Unpaid Leaves</strong></p>\n<p>Faculty members on ongoing appointments are eligible to apply for leave for personal reasons. Such leaves are without pay and benefits and will usually last for a minimum of one semester and a maximum of one year. Normally, only one year of personal leave will be outside the regular scheduling of reviews for reappointment, promotion, and tenure.</p>\n<p>The College will do its best to honor such requests, but it is incumbent upon the individual wishing such a leave to apply early enough so that the department affected may have time to plan for a replacement or make alternative arrangements for covering classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Vermont Earned Sick Time (VEST) for <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Non-regular</span> Faculty</strong></p>\n<p>Faculty members who are otherwise classified as <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">non-benefits-eligible</span> are provided with a paid time off benefit under the Vermont Earned Sick Leave Law, 21 V.S.A.&#x26;&#x26; 481-486.  VEST allows for certain paid time away from work for: physical or mental illness, preventative care, or to arrange services related to domestic violence or sexual assault.  Time can be for the employee’s own need or the needs of: a parent, spouse, child, sibling, parent-in-law, grandchild or foster child.  See the <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/time-away/4-14-vermont-earned-sick-time\">VEST Policy in the Middlebury Handbook</a> for details.</p>"},"a8af41ac-b537-5565-8b90-af17af392bf6":{"id":"a8af41ac-b537-5565-8b90-af17af392bf6","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/faculty/misc-policies","title":"C.24.

Research Leave Program","body":"\n**1\\. PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM**\n\nLeaves of absence are granted to enhance the scholarly and teaching capacity of the individual faculty member and to promote the general interest of the College.\n\n**2\\. BASIC ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM**\n\n**a.** Normally, a minimum of four consecutive academic years (eight consecutive semesters, when the last leave was a semester leave) should elapse before a faculty member becomes eligible for a one-semester leave, and, with the exception of the leaves described in paragraph c. below, five years in the case of a full-year leave. A colleague must have taught full time during the academic year preceding a leave. Exceptions are sometimes made in the case of intervening familial or disability leaves. Tenured colleagues may request that a future leave be split between an accelerated semester leave that occurs after five consecutive semesters of teaching, and a second semester of leave that is taken five semesters later. Departmental and College planning will have top priority in determining any exceptions to the policy of the leave of absence program.\n\nLeaves are granted on the basis of a leave proposal submitted to the dean for faculty development and research (DFDR) and are granted, following approval of the proposal by the DFDR, for one semester and winter term at 75 percent of regular salary during that period, or for a full academic year at 55 percent of regular salary, or, if an accelerated semester leave is approved, for a single semester and winter term at 55 percent of regular salary.\n\nTenured colleagues may request that a future leave be split between an accelerated semester leave that occurs after five consecutive semesters of teaching, and a second semester of leave that is taken after five semesters of full-time teaching. Colleagues approved for accelerated semester leaves are subject to the requirements of the leave program for a formal leave proposal (see Section 3c. below), and a grant-seeking plan (see Section 2b. below) for each semester. Such split leaves are governed by the salary guidelines for a full year leave, described in section 2b. below.\n\nRequests for accelerated semester leaves are made to the DFDR, at least four semesters in advance of the proposed leave, and must involve a specific research rationale for why such a leave is appropriate to the colleague’s research program. The colleague’s department chair will be consulted regarding the effect on departmental curriculum, including advising, thesis advising, and other obligations.  Departmental and College planning will have top priority in determining whether to approve a request for a split leave. A colleague who splits his or her leave into two semester leaves, and wants winter term off each of those years, must teach 2 winter terms between leaves.\n\n**b.** Colleagues, with the assistance of the Grants and Sponsored Programs Office, are expected to seek outside funding in support of their leave proposals. They are also expected to apply to sources for which they are eligible as determined by the DFDR in consultation with the colleague and the Grants and Sponsored Programs Office. Colleagues should make every effort to apply for grants that total up to 45 percent of salary for full year leaves and 25 percent of salary for semester/winter term leaves. It is understood that the College provides 75 percent for a semester leave and 55 percent for a year's leave. A colleague may not receive more than his or her full salary plus summer support (see sec. e), even when the leave salary is fully supported from external sources.\n\nOnce outside funding sources have been exhausted, the College will then consider paying (1) up to 100 percent of regular salary in support of a semester/winter term leave when it is taken after four full years of teaching, (2) 80 percent of regular salary for a full-year leave, or (3) 80 percent of regular salary for a semester leave when it is an accelerated semester leave taken after five consecutive semesters of teaching. The amount of an outside grant to a faculty member, and/or the amount of outside funding plus College funding, will not normally exceed the amount of the faculty member's own regular salary for the year in which the leave is taken. In the case of full-year leaves, if a colleague receives outside funding, the first 20 percent is used to make up the difference between 80 percent and 100 percent of salary; further outside funding reduces the College contribution accordingly.\n\n**c.** Faculty may become eligible for a full-year leave after four consecutive academic years of teaching. Such leaves are granted at 55 percent of salary, with no increase in salary after outside funding sources have been exhausted, and with no College supplementation of outside funding that the faculty member may receive.\n\n**d.** All faculty who apply for outside funding are required to submit to the DFDR copies of proposals sent to granting sources whether or not the awards involve institutional commitments. The College cannot guarantee leaves to faculty who have applied for and received outside funds for a year in which they are not scheduled for academic leave. However, requests for out-of-sequence leaves may be considered when a colleague is offered an unusual professional opportunity.\n\n**e.** Colleagues who seek funds for summer salary during academic leaves must discuss with the DFDR the impact of these funds, if awarded, on College contributions to the academic year salary. Normally, a colleague may seek summer support of no more than two-ninths of the previous academic year's salary.  This amount may rise to 2.5/9ths with permission of the VPAA/DoF.\n\n**f.** When the needs of the department or the College lead the administration to request that a colleague postpone a full-year leave according to the normal rotation, after six years of full-time teaching the automatic amount of salary paid will be 75 percent, rising to 90 percent once outside funding sources have been exhausted. If personal circumstances lead a colleague to choose to put off a leave, the normal funding rules will apply (see a. and b. above). The intent to take a full-year leave after six years must be announced at least three semesters in advance and must be accommodated in departmental planning.\n\n**g.** Normally, a leave of up to a full year for junior faculty colleagues will be scheduled for the second or third year after the first review, if that review is successful and provided the colleague has completed the Ph.D. or the appropriate terminal degree. The leave schedule for colleagues who come to Middlebury with prior service at other institutions will be determined at the time of appointment. Normally, colleagues are expected to teach for at least three years after their initial appointment before they are granted a leave.\n\n**h.** Faculty going on leave may be eligible for partial reimbursement of moving expenses to and/or from the principal place of leave activity. Such grants will be made, upon presentation of proper documentation, at the discretion of the DFDR. They will normally be made only to those faculty members whose research or other leave activity takes place outside Middlebury, and who will be leaving Middlebury for at least three months of their leave. They will not normally be made to those faculty members granted leave to take outside employment. If the budget of a grant won by a faculty member includes funds to support the expenses of relocation, the College's contribution to relocation expenses will be reduced accordingly.\n\n**i.** Any publications that result from a College-funded leave should acknowledge the support of Middlebury College.\n\n**<a name=\"leavereport\" id=\"leavereport\"></a>j.** Upon completion of leave, a full report on the faculty member's scholarly activity should be sent to the Office of the Dean for Faculty Development and Research, for inclusion in his or her file. Faculty must submit the report by September 1 following the leave in order to become eligible for future leaves.\n\n**3\\. IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n**a.** The needs and resources of the College program, and the ability to plan, will be a major factor in the implementation and maintenance of the leave program. The exact timing of individual leaves is subject to change due to department, program, or college needs.\n\n**b.** The leave program will be administered by the DFDR, who will recommend annually to the president and Board of Trustees faculty members to be granted leaves of absence for the following year. The Educational Affairs Committee will be consulted regarding the programmatic and staffing implications of a series of leaves and will make recommendations to the VPAA/DoF regarding any leaves to be replaced by outside appointments.\n\n**c.** Faculty whose names appear on the leave schedule for the following academic year must submit a leave proposal and a plan for seeking outside funding in support of that proposal to the DFDR no later than August 1.\n\n**d.** Department chairs requesting outside term replacements for colleagues on leave must submit their proposals for replacement positions to the dean of curriculum, for consideration by the Educational Affairs Committee, no later than the first Friday in April two academic years before the leave.\n\n <span class=\"caption\">_rev. 8/8/16_</span>","excerpt":"1.

Departmental and College planning will have top priority in determining any exceptions to the policy of the leave of absence program.</p>\n<p>Leaves are granted on the basis of a leave proposal submitted to the dean for faculty development and research (DFDR) and are granted, following approval of the proposal by the DFDR, for one semester and winter term at 75 percent of regular salary during that period, or for a full academic year at 55 percent of regular salary, or, if an accelerated semester leave is approved, for a single semester and winter term at 55 percent of regular salary.</p>\n<p>Tenured colleagues may request that a future leave be split between an accelerated semester leave that occurs after five consecutive semesters of teaching, and a second semester of leave that is taken after five semesters of full-time teaching. Colleagues approved for accelerated semester leaves are subject to the requirements of the leave program for a formal leave proposal (see Section 3c. below), and a grant-seeking plan (see Section 2b. below) for each semester. Such split leaves are governed by the salary guidelines for a full year leave, described in section 2b. below.</p>\n<p>Requests for accelerated semester leaves are made to the DFDR, at least four semesters in advance of the proposed leave, and must involve a specific research rationale for why such a leave is appropriate to the colleague’s research program. The colleague’s department chair will be consulted regarding the effect on departmental curriculum, including advising, thesis advising, and other obligations.  Departmental and College planning will have top priority in determining whether to approve a request for a split leave. A colleague who splits his or her leave into two semester leaves, and wants winter term off each of those years, must teach 2 winter terms between leaves.</p>\n<p><strong>b.</strong> Colleagues, with the assistance of the Grants and Sponsored Programs Office, are expected to seek outside funding in support of their leave proposals. They are also expected to apply to sources for which they are eligible as determined by the DFDR in consultation with the colleague and the Grants and Sponsored Programs Office. Colleagues should make every effort to apply for grants that total up to 45 percent of salary for full year leaves and 25 percent of salary for semester/winter term leaves. It is understood that the College provides 75 percent for a semester leave and 55 percent for a year's leave. A colleague may not receive more than his or her full salary plus summer support (see sec. e), even when the leave salary is fully supported from external sources.</p>\n<p>Once outside funding sources have been exhausted, the College will then consider paying (1) up to 100 percent of regular salary in support of a semester/winter term leave when it is taken after four full years of teaching, (2) 80 percent of regular salary for a full-year leave, or (3) 80 percent of regular salary for a semester leave when it is an accelerated semester leave taken after five consecutive semesters of teaching. The amount of an outside grant to a faculty member, and/or the amount of outside funding plus College funding, will not normally exceed the amount of the faculty member's own regular salary for the year in which the leave is taken. In the case of full-year leaves, if a colleague receives outside funding, the first 20 percent is used to make up the difference between 80 percent and 100 percent of salary; further outside funding reduces the College contribution accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>c.</strong> Faculty may become eligible for a full-year leave after four consecutive academic years of teaching. Such leaves are granted at 55 percent of salary, with no increase in salary after outside funding sources have been exhausted, and with no College supplementation of outside funding that the faculty member may receive.</p>\n<p><strong>d.</strong> All faculty who apply for outside funding are required to submit to the DFDR copies of proposals sent to granting sources whether or not the awards involve institutional commitments. The College cannot guarantee leaves to faculty who have applied for and received outside funds for a year in which they are not scheduled for academic leave. However, requests for out-of-sequence leaves may be considered when a colleague is offered an unusual professional opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>e.</strong> Colleagues who seek funds for summer salary during academic leaves must discuss with the DFDR the impact of these funds, if awarded, on College contributions to the academic year salary. Normally, a colleague may seek summer support of no more than two-ninths of the previous academic year's salary.  This amount may rise to 2.5/9ths with permission of the VPAA/DoF.</p>\n<p><strong>f.</strong> When the needs of the department or the College lead the administration to request that a colleague postpone a full-year leave according to the normal rotation, after six years of full-time teaching the automatic amount of salary paid will be 75 percent, rising to 90 percent once outside funding sources have been exhausted. If personal circumstances lead a colleague to choose to put off a leave, the normal funding rules will apply (see a. and b. above). The intent to take a full-year leave after six years must be announced at least three semesters in advance and must be accommodated in departmental planning.</p>\n<p><strong>g.</strong> Normally, a leave of up to a full year for junior faculty colleagues will be scheduled for the second or third year after the first review, if that review is successful and provided the colleague has completed the Ph.D. or the appropriate terminal degree. The leave schedule for colleagues who come to Middlebury with prior service at other institutions will be determined at the time of appointment. Normally, colleagues are expected to teach for at least three years after their initial appointment before they are granted a leave.</p>\n<p><strong>h.</strong> Faculty going on leave may be eligible for partial reimbursement of moving expenses to and/or from the principal place of leave activity. Such grants will be made, upon presentation of proper documentation, at the discretion of the DFDR. They will normally be made only to those faculty members whose research or other leave activity takes place outside Middlebury, and who will be leaving Middlebury for at least three months of their leave. They will not normally be made to those faculty members granted leave to take outside employment. If the budget of a grant won by a faculty member includes funds to support the expenses of relocation, the College's contribution to relocation expenses will be reduced accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>i.</strong> Any publications that result from a College-funded leave should acknowledge the support of Middlebury College.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"leavereport\" id=\"leavereport\"></a>j.</strong> Upon completion of leave, a full report on the faculty member's scholarly activity should be sent to the Office of the Dean for Faculty Development and Research, for inclusion in his or her file. Faculty must submit the report by September 1 following the leave in order to become eligible for future leaves.</p>\n<p><strong>3. IMPLEMENTATION</strong></p>\n<p><strong>a.</strong> The needs and resources of the College program, and the ability to plan, will be a major factor in the implementation and maintenance of the leave program. The exact timing of individual leaves is subject to change due to department, program, or college needs.</p>\n<p><strong>b.</strong> The leave program will be administered by the DFDR, who will recommend annually to the president and Board of Trustees faculty members to be granted leaves of absence for the following year. The Educational Affairs Committee will be consulted regarding the programmatic and staffing implications of a series of leaves and will make recommendations to the VPAA/DoF regarding any leaves to be replaced by outside appointments.</p>\n<p><strong>c.</strong> Faculty whose names appear on the leave schedule for the following academic year must submit a leave proposal and a plan for seeking outside funding in support of that proposal to the DFDR no later than August 1.</p>\n<p><strong>d.</strong> Department chairs requesting outside term replacements for colleagues on leave must submit their proposals for replacement positions to the dean of curriculum, for consideration by the Educational Affairs Committee, no later than the first Friday in April two academic years before the leave.</p>\n<p> <span class=\"caption\"><em>rev. 8/8/16</em></span></p>"},"62e2b74b-e11b-5967-a63b-6acba9b60363":{"id":"62e2b74b-e11b-5967-a63b-6acba9b60363","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/faculty/outside-employment","title":"C.14.

Rules of Reappointment for Physical Education Faculty","body":"\n**1\\. Review and Reappointment in the Department of Physical Education**\n\n**a. _Review Schedule._** The athletic director will review all instructors and assistants in the Department of Physical Education and Athletics on an annual basis.  Reviews of coaches who do not have head coaching responsibilities will be conducted in conjunction with the appropriate head coach(es).  Evaluations of all instructors in physical education will focus on their promise and performance as coaches, and as physical education instructors.  Reviews will generally occur at the conclusion of the coaches' prime coaching season, and final recommendations will be forwarded to the dean of the College by May 10, with notification taking place as specified in section 4.f. Notification Date, of the Faculty Handbook \"Rules of Appointment and Tenure for Academic Faculty.\"  After two consecutive, one-year contracts, an instructor may be offered a two-year contract, which may be renewed at the conclusion of the first two-year contract.  After six years as an instructor in physical education, assuming positive evaluations, the coach may be awarded a three-year contract, and will be appointed to the rank of assistant in physical education.  Coaches who do not have \"head\" coaching responsibilities are limited to attaining the rank of assistant in physical education and can be awarded renewable three-year term contracts following written recommendation by the director of athletics.\n\nNew head coaches, with previous coaching experience, may be hired at the rank of assistant in physical education, and initially awarded a three-year contract.  Upon satisfactory yearly reviews, a second three-year contract may be granted, and annual reviews by the director of athletics will continue on a yearly basis.  After six years as an assistant in physical education, assuming positive evaluations and the satisfactory completion of the major review, a head coach will be promoted to associate in physical education and will receive a renewable five-year contract.\n\n**b. _First Five-Year Review_**.  During the sixth year at the rank of assistant in physical education, the Physical Education and Athletics Committee on Reappointment (PEACOR), composed of the Senior Woman Administrator (SWA), a senior associate in physical education, elected by the members of the department, and the chair of the Athletic Policy Committee of the Faculty (APC), will initiate a major review to determine whether the head coach under review will be promoted to the rank of associate in physical education and awarded a renewable five-year contract.  The director of Athletics and the dean of the College will serve in advisory capacities to PEACOR during its proceedings.  To be considered for this promotion a head coach must be judged to be an outstanding coach and teacher, based upon the performance criteria listed below.  The PEACOR will forward its recommendation to the dean of the College and the president for final approval.  A head coach who is not offered a five-year contract will be offered a one-year terminal contract, and notified in writing regarding the new contract as specified in section 4.f. Notification Date, of the Faculty Handbook \"Rules of Appointment and Tenure for Academic Faculty.\"\n\n(Note: This review is of major importance, since it parallels an academic professors' review for tenure, and accordingly the granting of associate rank.  The granting of a multi-year renewable contract is a significant one, in that the college is acknowledging its desire to provide contractual stability to the coach, based on continued outstanding coaching and teaching performance.)\n\n**c. _Second Five-Year Review._** During the fifth year the associate in physical education will undergo a second review by the PEACOR.  The procedures of the review will be the same as for the first five-year review.  The PEACOR will notify the dean of the College and the president of its recommendation, and the coach will receive written notification as specified in section 4.f. Notification Date, of the Faculty Handbook \"Rules of Appointment and Tenure for Academic Faculty.\"  Upon a positive review, the associate will be granted a second five-year contract.  If the review is unsatisfactory, the coach will be offered a two-year terminal contract.\n\n**d. _Seven-Year Review._** In the tenth year at the rank of associate in physical education the head coach will be reviewed by the PEACOR.  Evaluations by the PEACOR will be acted upon as previously described.  Upon a positive review, the associate will be promoted to the rank of senior associate and granted a seven-year contract.  If the review is unsatisfactory, the coach will be offered a two-year terminal contract.  These reviews will continue every seven years.\n\n(Note: Colleagues moving through the process granted 3-year rolling contracts prior to September 1, 2002 will move through the Associate and Senior Associate ranks with Major Reviews at 5 years at the Associate Level and every seven years at the Senior Associate Level.)\n\n**e. _Appeal Process._** In the event the PEACOR does not recommend promotion and a multi-year contract, any appeals will follow the procedures stated in the Appeals section in the Faculty Handbook.  References in this section to the Reappointments and Promotions Committee, will be relegated to the Physical Education and Athletics Committee on Reappointment, and followed in the same manner through the appeals process.\n\n**f. _Termination for Cause._** Termination of a contract may occur at any time and will follow the provisions of section c. of \"Special Provisions\" in the Faculty Handbook.  The Physical Education and Athletics Committee on Reappointment will perform the role of the Promotions Committee in section c.\n\n**g. _Reappointment and Review Criteria_**\n\nAll coaching faculty are hired with the expectation of being outstanding teachers.  All coaches are expected to value the role that they play in the education of their student-athletes, and will be actively supportive in insuring that their students' opportunity to excel in their academic pursuits is always viewed as being of paramount importance.  The pursuit of excellence is an attitude that all coaches will attempt to instill in their athletes, to the extent that this pursuit will be evident in their academic growth, in their positive contributions made to the campus community, and in their athletic endeavors.\n\nCoaching faculty are evaluated in the areas listed below:\n\n  \n**_Commitment to the core mission of the College_**\n\n*   Commitment to the Middlebury College Mission Statement, NESCAC Mission Statement and the NCAA Division III Philosophy\n*   Adherence to College, Conference and NCAA rules and policies\n*   Effectiveness in assisting students in finding a healthy balance between athletic interests and academic priorities\n*   Effectiveness in supporting students in attaining their educational goals\n\n**_Teaching Physical Education Classes_**\n\n*   Knowledge of fundamental skills and concepts\n*   Organization and lesson plan progression to achieve stated goals\n*   Instructional communication, drill utilization and skill acquisition\n*   Promotion of wellness\n\n**_Coaching and Teaching_**\n\n*   Practice organization/time management\n*   Skills analysis, teaching and progression\n*   Tactics/strategy development/game day adaptability\n*   Team fitness preparation and maintenance\n*   Team and player motivation, coach-player relationship, student welfare\n*   Team performance - Use and teaching of rules, academic performance, community service\n*   Professional growth – certifications, memberships, public speaking, camps and clinics, awards/recognition\n*   Recruiting and promotion:  \n    --Public relations – media, alumni  \n    --Ability to attract and yield top student-athletes\n\n**_Administration and Organization_**\n\n*   Professional traits – communication/organizational skills, punctuality, work ethic\n*   Budget management\n*   Trip organization\n*   Meeting deadlines\n*   Relations with support staff\n\n**_Service_**\n\n*   Department involvement and initiatives\n*   Involvement with College community\n*   Community service – service to community, mentoring\n\n**2.** **Review Procedures in the Department of Physical Education and Athletics**\n\n**_a. Annual review._** Prior to May 10th, the athletic director will meet individually with each head coach.  Prior to the meeting the athletic director will gather information from the following sources to assist in the evaluation: 1) Physical Education evaluation forms and a written summary of evaluation from the director of physical education, 2) Student assessment of coaching forms to be completed by all team members, 3) Written summation of captains evaluation meeting with the athletic director, 4) Coaching year-end self evaluation form and 5) the athletic director will have personally observed a minimum of one practice and one varsity contest. Reviews of coaches who do not have head coaching responsibilities will be conducted in conjunction with the appropriate head coach(es) and reviewed by the director of athletics.\n\nEvaluation Process - The athletic director will provide a written evaluation to the candidates based on the year-end evaluation form.  Areas of strengths will be noted, and a plan will be formulated to address any areas of weakness.  If the evaluation is negative and the review falls at the end of a contract period, the coach will be notified in writing as specified in section 4.f. Notification Date, of the Faculty Handbook \"Rules of Appointment and Tenure for Academic Faculty.\"  A head coach or assistant coach with no \"head\" coaching responsibility on an extended contract (two or three years) will not be terminated in the final year of the contract unless the coach has been notified in writing of previous shortcoming that would need to be improved upon to the satisfaction of the athletic director or head coach during the final year of the contract.\n\n**_b. First Five-Year Review._** Because of the variety of forms of instruction, and the multiplicity of tasks that are required in coaching, the PEACOR will examine all possible avenues to assure that evidence of coaching and teaching excellence is assured.  A satisfactory review is required in order for the head coach to be considered for a renewable five-year contract.  This review should clearly show that the coach is already an outstanding head coach and teacher.  All review materials must be submitted to the committee by March 1.  The committee will gather assessment information in the following ways:\n\ni.  The Candidate  \n(a) The head coach will provide a complete vita of all professional accomplishments and service contributions, as well as a self-evaluation that concentrates on these accomplishments and contributions with reference to the criteria listed in section 1.g.vii., above.  This self-evaluation should also address the coach's plans for future professional growth.  \n(b) The coach will provide copies of organizational plans, playbook, published articles, etc., and any other data to support their coaching abilities and professional growth.  \n(c) To furnish the PEACOR with a list of professional colleagues outside Middlebury who would be appropriate to evaluate the candidate's professional achievements.

A candidate's decision not to submit such materials is in no way prejudicial to reappointment.   \n(b) The PEACOR will utilize all of the evaluative tools that are used in the annual reviews, and will have access to previous yearly performance reviews. The athletic director will include a summation of these evaluations for the committee in order to bring perspective.  \n(c) To arrange with the candidate an appropriate schedule to observe at least one practice and/or physical education class and one scheduled athletic contest.\n\niii.  Dean of the College  \n(a) To initiate the review in a timely fashion so that all necessary information and documentation may be obtained from the candidate and other sources.  \n(b) To solicit information, on behalf of the PEACOR, from candidates under review; to gather information from other sources when so requested by the PEACOR.  \n(c) To serve as recording secretary of the PEACOR.  \n(d) To provide counsel to the PEACOR during the course of its deliberations.  \n(e) To provide counsel to the president when the PEACOR's deliberations are completed.\n\niv.

Second Five-Year Review_**. The procedure for review will be exactly the same as for the first five-year review.\n\n**_d. Seven-year Review_**. The procedure for the review will be exactly the same as for the second five-year review. Outside recommendations will not be sought by the committee, but may be provided by the coach.\n\n**_e. Confidentiality and Access for review materials in the Department of Physical Education and Athletics._** Letters from students, and from peers both within and outside the institution, are always confidential, and will be made available to the candidate only in the event of a contract being denied.  All student evaluation forms will be made available to the candidate, as well as to the committee.  The athletic director will include a summation of these evaluations for the committee in order to bring perspective.  This summation will be made available to the candidate, prior to its submission to the committee.  The athletic director will also write a letter that summarizes, without attribution, the written views of the department members with associate or senior status in the department and it will be available to the candidate at the time it is submitted to the committee.  The dean of the College, the provost, and the president, as well as all members of the PEACOR will have access to all the materials requested in section **_b_**, above.","excerpt":"1.

Notification Date, of the Faculty Handbook \"Rules of Appointment and Tenure for Academic Faculty.\"  A head coach or assistant coach with no \"head\" coaching responsibility on an extended contract (two or three years) will not be terminated in the final year of the contract unless the coach has been notified in writing of previous shortcoming that would need to be improved upon to the satisfaction of the athletic director or head coach during the final year of the contract.</p>\n<p><strong><em>b. First Five-Year Review.</em></strong> Because of the variety of forms of instruction, and the multiplicity of tasks that are required in coaching, the PEACOR will examine all possible avenues to assure that evidence of coaching and teaching excellence is assured.  A satisfactory review is required in order for the head coach to be considered for a renewable five-year contract.  This review should clearly show that the coach is already an outstanding head coach and teacher.  All review materials must be submitted to the committee by March 1.  The committee will gather assessment information in the following ways:</p>\n<p>i.  The Candidate<br>\n(a) The head coach will provide a complete vita of all professional accomplishments and service contributions, as well as a self-evaluation that concentrates on these accomplishments and contributions with reference to the criteria listed in section 1.g.vii., above.  This self-evaluation should also address the coach's plans for future professional growth.<br>\n(b) The coach will provide copies of organizational plans, playbook, published articles, etc., and any other data to support their coaching abilities and professional growth.<br>\n(c) To furnish the PEACOR with a list of professional colleagues outside Middlebury who would be appropriate to evaluate the candidate's professional achievements. A minimum of four will be required.<br>\n(d) The candidate may seek up to two written comments from non-departmental colleagues from within the college community.<br>\n(e) Seek written comment from the admissions office liaison, if it is applicable.<br>\n(f) To provide PEACOR through the director of athletics, or the director's designate, an appropriate schedule of practice or physical education class visits.</p>\n<p>ii.  Physical Education and Athletics Committee on Reappointment (PEACOR)<br>\n(a) To meet with the candidates for the first review, in a group or individually, to explain to them the procedures; and to invite the candidates to submit, either orally or in writing, any additional information that may be pertinent to their reviews. A candidate's decision not to submit such materials is in no way prejudicial to reappointment. <br>\n(b) The PEACOR will utilize all of the evaluative tools that are used in the annual reviews, and will have access to previous yearly performance reviews. The athletic director will include a summation of these evaluations for the committee in order to bring perspective.<br>\n(c) To arrange with the candidate an appropriate schedule to observe at least one practice and/or physical education class and one scheduled athletic contest.</p>\n<p>iii.  Dean of the College<br>\n(a) To initiate the review in a timely fashion so that all necessary information and documentation may be obtained from the candidate and other sources.<br>\n(b) To solicit information, on behalf of the PEACOR, from candidates under review; to gather information from other sources when so requested by the PEACOR.<br>\n(c) To serve as recording secretary of the PEACOR.<br>\n(d) To provide counsel to the PEACOR during the course of its deliberations.<br>\n(e) To provide counsel to the president when the PEACOR's deliberations are completed.</p>\n<p>iv. Director of Athletics<br>\n(a) To maintain the candidates' review files, including teaching evaluation forms.<br>\n(b) The director of athletics will seek written peer reviews from all department members with senior associate or associate status not serving on PEACOR and will write a letter, without attribution, that summarizes views of those department members. At the discretion of the director of athletics a candidate may be asked to write a letter for a colleague under review.<br>\n(c) To serve in an advisory capacity to the PEACOR during the course of its deliberations.</p>\n<p>v. President<br>\n(a) To hear reports from the PEACOR on the substance of its conclusions about each constituent part of the case and about the case as a whole.<br>\n(b) To consult with the dean of the College about the individual cases.<br>\n(c) To challenge any conclusion of the PEACOR with which he or she disagrees and give the PEACOR an opportunity to respond.<br>\n(d) In the case of a reversal of the committee's recommendation, to explain to the committee the reasons for doing so, reasons which in a written summary become part of the review file.<br>\n(e) To make the final decision and to notify the candidate in a letter that indicates the recommendation of the PEACOR.</p>\n<p><strong><em>c. Second Five-Year Review</em></strong>. The procedure for review will be exactly the same as for the first five-year review.</p>\n<p><strong><em>d. Seven-year Review</em></strong>. The procedure for the review will be exactly the same as for the second five-year review. Outside recommendations will not be sought by the committee, but may be provided by the coach.</p>\n<p><strong><em>e. Confidentiality and Access for review materials in the Department of Physical Education and Athletics.</em></strong> Letters from students, and from peers both within and outside the institution, are always confidential, and will be made available to the candidate only in the event of a contract being denied.  All student evaluation forms will be made available to the candidate, as well as to the committee.  The athletic director will include a summation of these evaluations for the committee in order to bring perspective.  This summation will be made available to the candidate, prior to its submission to the committee.  The athletic director will also write a letter that summarizes, without attribution, the written views of the department members with associate or senior status in the department and it will be available to the candidate at the time it is submitted to the committee.  The dean of the College, the provost, and the president, as well as all members of the PEACOR will have access to all the materials requested in section <strong><em>b</em></strong>, above.</p>"},"c9509159-9396-5e01-b258-5d1bbf944b94":{"id":"c9509159-9396-5e01-b258-5d1bbf944b94","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/faculty/reprints-subventions","title":"C.12.

Faculty Misconduct","body":"\n_a. General Principles_\n\n_In determining whether a faculty member’s actions constitute professional misconduct, and in determining any penalties for faculty misconduct, up to and including termination, faculty members, administrators, and Trustees will act in accordance with the following principles:_\n\n1.  Faculty members are expected to conform to all ethical standards of the profession, such as those enumerated in the American Association of University Professors’ _Statement on Professional Ethics_ ([https://www.aaup.org/report/statement-professional-ethics](https://www.aaup.org/report/statement-professional-ethics)).\n2.  All members of the faculty, whether tenured or not, are entitled to academic freedom as set forth in the 1940 _Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure_, formulated by the Association of American Colleges and Universities and the American Association of University Professors. Exercises of academic freedom, including the expression of dissent or unpopular opinions, do not constitute faculty misconduct, and cannot incur a penalty.\n3.  The principle of presumed innocence applies: until the process of review is complete, the faculty member is presumed innocent.\n4.  The grounds for a finding of faculty misconduct and imposition of penalties must be specific and concrete.\n5.  Criminal activity may constitute faculty misconduct where such activity could reasonably be seen to substantially compromise a faculty member's ability to carry out his or her responsibilities as a teacher, scholar, and contributor to the functioning and governing of the College.  Civil disobedience, non-violent protest, and expression of opinions, even where such activities result in civil or criminal penalties, do not amount to faculty misconduct under this section.  Crimes involving violence or deliberate and consequential dishonesty, on the other hand, may constitute misconduct.\n6.  The principle of proportionality applies: the penalty must be commensurate with the severity of the misconduct in question. Only the most serious violations of a faculty member’s responsibilities as a teacher, scholar, and contributor to the functioning and governance of the college, especially actions that pose an imminent threat to the safety of others and the flagrant interference with the efforts of colleagues and students to exercise their rights of free inquiry and expression, can be considered as adequate cause for termination.\n7.  Considerations of political opinions, race, creed, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, legally recognized forms of disability, or economic considerations—e.g., relating to the individual's salary level, length of contract—are absolutely prohibited in determining grounds for misconduct or assigning penalties for misconduct.\n8.  The principle of equal treatment should apply: instances of misconduct that are similar in nature and magnitude should be met with penalties that are similar in nature and magnitude, regardless of the identities of the faculty members involved.\n9.  Public perceptions and media representations of a faculty member should play no role in determining if misconduct has occurred, or in assessing any penalties that result from misconduct.\n10. Faculty participation is central to the hiring and promotion of our colleagues. The principle of self-governance requires that the faculty be significantly involved in the review of a colleague accused of professional misconduct.\n11. While the Board of Trustees has ultimate authority in matters involving faculty misconduct, in keeping with the principle of faculty self-governance, the Board will give considerable deference to the recommendations of the faculty and administration regarding faculty misconduct. In the event that the Board disagrees with the faculty’s or administration’s recommendations, the Board will provide a substantive written justification for its decision.\n\n_b. Definitions of Lesser Misconduct, Grounds for Termination, and Violations of the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy and/or the Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking_\n\nThere are three categories of professional misconduct: lesser misconduct, grounds for termination, and misconduct associated with violations of the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy and/or the Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking. Additionally, faculty members may face penalties (including termination) for teaching ineffectiveness, even if no misconduct has occurred. All allegations of misconduct or teaching ineffectiveness will be considered in the context of the general principles described in section _a_ above. In all instances of alleged misconduct or teaching ineffectiveness, the faculty member will be secure in his or her right to a fair and impartial hearing.\n\n_i. Lesser misconduct._ In keeping with the principle of proportionality, some professional misconduct does not constitute sufficient grounds for termination of employment. Such “lesser misconduct” includes, but is not limited to, violations of the Employee Code of Conduct that do not satisfy the specific grounds for termination set forth in section _b.ii._, and violations of the principles of faculty conduct set forth in section _a_ that do not satisfy the specific grounds for termination set forth in section _b.ii_.\n\n_ii. Grounds for termination._ Faculty on appointment for any term, including tenure, may have their appointment terminated prior to the specifications of the appointment only by special action of designated and appropriate College authorities with adequate cause and according to the procedures described below. As per the proportionality principle, termination <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"> </span> for any reason may be undertaken only in the most exceptional circumstances and only for the most compelling reasons. Tenure is a primary protection for academic freedom and contributes to the stability necessary for the development of the College. At the same time, tenure is not simply a guarantee of appointment until retirement. Specific serious offenses may result in termination for cause. A continued pattern of teaching performance that is judged to be below minimally acceptable standards may also result in termination.\n\nThe following are considered as grounds for termination:\n\n(a) Flagrant and deliberate violations of the rules and procedures of the Middlebury College faculty; persistent failure to carry out specified teaching assignments as these are determined by a department or by the Curriculum Committee of the College. Action cannot be taken under the latter clause against a faculty member whose academic directions have not changed but who is a member of a department that has undertaken new directions and therefore has developed new needs.\n\n(b) Severe abuse of professional authority; deliberate coercion of others; deliberate suppression of the freedom of thought necessary in an academic community; patterns of behavior that fundamentally compromise a faculty member's ability to carry out his or her responsibilities as a teacher, scholar, and contributor to the functioning and governance of the College.\n\n(c) Actions that are willfully destructive of College facilities or pose an imminent threat to the safety of others.\n\n(d) Serious criminal conduct as defined in _General Principles_ section _a. v._<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"></span>\n\n(e) Teaching ineffectiveness. (Procedures defined below in section _f_.)\n\n_iii. Violations of the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy and/or the Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking_. Reports of misconduct that, if proven, would violate the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy and/or the Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking will be investigated according to the procedures described in those policies.  Sanctions, including, potentially, termination for cause and other sanctions listed in section _g_. of this policy, will be determined according to the procedures that are described below in that section.\n\n_c. Administrative Procedures regarding Allegations of Lesser Misconduct and/or Grounds for Termination_\n\n_i._ When an allegation of professional misconduct has been made, the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty (VPAA/DoF) will make a preliminary inquiry and will discuss the matter with those administrative officers he or she deems appropriate. If the VPAA/DoF concludes that the alleged misconduct, were it to be substantiated, might constitute professional misconduct, and therefore that further inquiry is warranted, then they will meet in confidence with the accused faculty member to discuss the alleged violation. The faculty member and the VPAA/DoF may each invite an <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"> </span> adviser of their choice, typically a tenured faculty colleague, to assist them, or to act as counsel. Under all circumstances, the VPAA/DoF will report the details of the case to the provost.\n\nIn consultation with the VPAA/DoF, the provost will then propose one of three possible outcomes:\n\n(a)    If the provost finds no misconduct, then the faculty member will incur no penalty, contingent on the approval of the Board of Trustees as described in section _c.iv._\n\n(b)   If the provost finds grounds only for lesser misconduct (as defined in _b.i._), then the provost will recommend a penalty less than termination, with subsequent procedures described in section _c.ii._\n\n(c)    If the provost finds grounds for termination (as defined in _b.ii._), then the case will be directed to the Promotions Committee for a misconduct review, as described in section _d._\n\nThe VPAA/DoF will inform the complainant(s) in writing whether the provost has recommended to the Board that the matter be dropped, whether a lesser penalty will be pursued, or whether a misconduct review will be initiated.\n\n_ii._ If the provost finds that lesser misconduct has occurred, then, in consultation with the VPAA/DoF, the provost will recommend a penalty less than termination. If the faculty member accepts the recommended penalty, then that penalty is enacted, contingent on approval by the Board of Trustees as described in section _c.iv_. Alternatively, the faculty member may reject the recommended penalty, which initiates a misconduct discussion as described in section _c.iii_.\n\n_iii._ If the faculty member rejects a recommendation for a penalty less than termination in the process described in _c.ii._, then the VPAA/DOF, provost, and faculty member will engage in a misconduct discussion with the aim of finding a mutually acceptable outcome. If the three parties agree on an outcome within 30 days, then that agreement shall be enacted, contingent on the final approval by the Board of Trustees as described in section _c.iv_. In this case, the Board will be informed of the provost’s initial penalty proposal and the outcome agreed upon in the misconduct discussion. In all other cases, the matter will be turned over to the Promotions Committee for a misconduct review, as described in section _d_. In this case, the Promotions Committee will be informed of the provost’s initial penalty proposal.\n\n_iv._ If the faculty member, VPAA/DoF, and provost agree on either no penalty or on a penalty less than termination, and the Promotions Committee has not reviewed the matter, the provost will report the allegation and recommended outcome to the Board of Trustees. This report will not divulge the names of the faculty member or of any individuals who participated in these deliberations.\n\nIf the Board accepts the provost’s recommendation, then that recommendation will be enacted. If the Board rejects the provost’s recommendation, then the Board will identify factors that either the VPAA/DoF and/or the provost has failed to consider, and that the Board deems relevant to the case. The Board will communicate these factors to both the Promotions Committee and the provost, and the Promotions Committee will initiate the misconduct review procedures described in section d. Both the Promotions Committee and the provost will address in their written findings (as described in section _d.ii._) their assessment of the specific factors that the Board of Trustees has recommended that they consider. If either the Promotions Committee or the provost disagrees with the Board as to the interpretation and importance of these considerations, they will include the grounds of this disagreement in these written findings.\n\n_d. Misconduct Review Procedures_\n\n_i._ Following a provost’s recommendation for a misconduct review, as described in section _c.i_(c), a misconduct discussion not resulting in a mutually acceptable outcome as described in section _c.iii.,_ or a Board of Trustees recommendation for a misconduct review, as described in section _c.iv._, the case will be turned over to the Promotions Committee. In such cases, the VPAA/DoF will promptly inform the faculty member, in writing, of the identity of the person or persons who initiated the charge, the allegation of misconduct being considered, and the sources of any information about the case. The statement given to the faculty member will be framed with due concern for the rights of the parties involved. The person or persons who initiated the charge will be informed that their identity is being revealed to the accused faculty member and that the Promotions Committee is considering the matter. Middlebury College will protect from retaliation anyone who makes a good faith effort to appropriately disclose perceived professional misconduct. However, the College reserves the right to distinguish between retaliation and ongoing performance management related to the \"whistleblower.\"  See the College's Whistleblower policy for further elaboration.\n\nOnce the Promotions Committee has begun the misconduct review, the VPAA/DoF will make available to the committee all information pertaining to the matter that he or she possesses. The provost and the VPAA/DoF will cooperate with the committee in any inquiries the committee deems necessary. The VPAA/DoF will not otherwise participate in the Promotions Committee's proceedings or deliberations. The faculty member will be given fair opportunity to prepare and present their defense and will be permitted to call upon an adviser of their choice, typically a tenured faculty colleague, to assist them, or to act as counsel.  In the course of the review, the faculty member will have an opportunity to confront witnesses against them.\n\nThe faculty ombudsperson will attend all proceedings of the Promotions Committee that incorporate interviews or testimony in the case. The Promotions Committee will also keep the ombudsperson informed of the committee's work. The ombudsperson will keep the provost informed of the committee's work. A professional reporter will transcribe any interviews and testimony heard by the committee. All parties must agree to the content of the transcript before it becomes the official record of the proceedings.  The faculty member and the provost will each have full access to all records of interviews and testimony at the committee's proceedings as these records become available.\n\n_ii._ After a full review of the case, the Promotions Committee will recommend one of three possible outcomes:\n\n(a) If the Promotions Committee finds no grounds for misconduct, it will recommend that the faculty member incur no penalty.\n\n(b) If the Promotions Committee finds only grounds for lesser misconduct, it will recommend a penalty less than termination.\n\n(c) If the Promotions Committee finds grounds for termination, it will recommend that the faculty member be terminated for cause.\n\nThe Promotions Committee will inform the faculty member and provost in writing of its findings and recommendations.\n\nThe provost will consider the recommendation of the Promotions Committee. Within 14 days of receiving this recommendation, except where exigent circumstances require otherwise, the provost will present his or her own recommendation, orally and in writing, to the faculty member and to the Promotions Committee. The written findings of the Promotions Committee and the provost will be provided to the Board of Trustees. These reports will not divulge the names of the faculty member or of any individuals who participated in the review.\n\nIf the provost and the Promotions Committee recommend the same outcome, then that outcome will be enacted, contingent on approval by the Board of Trustees, as described in section _d.iv._ Otherwise, they will initiate a misconduct discussion as described in section _d.iii_.\n\n_iii._ If the provost rejects the Promotions Committee’s recommendation in the process described in _d.ii._, then the Promotions Committee and provost will engage in a misconduct discussion with the aim of finding a mutually acceptable outcome. If the two parties agree on an outcome within 14 days, then that agreement shall be enacted, contingent on approval by the Board of Trustees as described in section _d.iv_. In this case, the Board will be informed of the Promotion Committee’s and provost’s initial penalty proposals and the outcome agreed upon in the misconduct discussion. In all other cases, the matter will be turned over to the Board of Trustees for a misconduct hearing, as described in section _d.v_. In this case, the Board will be informed of the Promotion Committee’s and provost’s initial penalty proposals.\n\n_iv._ If the Promotions Committee and provost agree on a recommended outcome, then the provost will report the allegation and recommended outcome to the Board of Trustees. This report will not divulge the names of the faculty member or of any individuals who participated in these deliberations.\n\nIf the Board accepts the provost’s recommendation, then that recommendation will be enacted. The faculty member may otherwise appeal to the Board of Trustees who will conduct a Misconduct Hearing as described in section _d.v._ If the Board rejects the provost’s recommendation, then the Board will conduct a misconduct hearing as described in section _d.v._\n\n_v._ In circumstances that require the Board of Trustees to conduct a misconduct hearing, the Board will establish a Hearing Panel of at least three of its members to consider the case. The work of the Hearing Panel will include a review of all of the documentation of the case; a meeting with the faculty member who was charged; an interview with the Promotions Committee; an interview with the provost; and all further investigations and interviews that the Hearing Panel deems necessary. The faculty member will be given fair opportunity to prepare and present his or her defense, and will be permitted to call upon an adviser of their choice, typically a tenured faculty colleague, to assist them, or to act as counsel. If, in the course of its investigation, the Board identifies factors that the Promotions Committee or provost has failed to consider and that the Board deems relevant to the case, the Board will communicate these factors to both the Promotions Committee and the provost, allowing each to register any disagreements as to the interpretation and importance of these factors. A professional reporter will produce a verbatim transcript of the proceedings of the Hearing Panel. The faculty member will have full access to all records of the proceedings of the Hearing Panel. The work of the Hearing Panel must be completed within 60 days except where exigent circumstances require otherwise. If the Hearing is not completed within 60 days, the accused faculty member will be informed of the delay, the reason for it, and an expected completion date.\n\nAfter the Hearing Panel completes its work, the Board of Trustees will decide on three possible outcomes:\n\n(a)    If the Hearing Panel finds no grounds for misconduct, the faculty member will incur no penalty.\n\n(b)   If the Hearing Panel finds only grounds for lesser misconduct, it will impose a penalty less than termination.<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"></span><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"></span>\n\n(c)    If the Hearing Panel finds grounds for termination, then the faculty member’s employment will be terminated with cause, and the faculty member will not be offered any subsequent employment at the College.\n\nThe Board’s decision is final and will be carried out by the provost.\n\n_vi._ From the moment the provost finds grounds for professional misconduct until the time when the Board of Trustees reaches its final decision, the faculty member may end the proceedings by resigning.  When the charge against the faculty member is based in whole or in part on deliberate harm to others (e.g., harassment), however, the faculty member will not be permitted to take early retirement or resign effective at a later date in exchange for the charges being dropped.  If the faculty member chooses to resign, the resignation must take effect immediately.\n\n_vii._ Whenever the Promotions Committee has conducted a misconduct review in which either it, the provost, or the Board has recommended that a faculty member’s employment be terminated, it will, at the last faculty meeting of the term in which the review has taken place, report to the voting members of the faculty: (1) the general category (according to Grounds for Termination _b_._ii._ (a)-(e) above) of the allegations brought, and (2) whether the committee recommended that the faculty member’s employment be terminated. This report will not divulge the names of the faculty member or of any individuals having participated in the review and will be entered into the records of the faculty. If a faculty member ends a misconduct review by resigning, the cessation of the review and the reason for its cessation will be reported to all individuals having participated in the review, and to the faculty, in the manner described above.\n\n_viii._ If at any point in the course of a misconduct review, it is found that the faculty member engaged in additional or more severe misconduct, but these actions were not the original basis for the misconduct review, the VPAA/DoF will be informed of the additional evidence and/or allegations. The VPAA/DoF may determine that the original misconduct review will continue for the original actions and that the more recently discovered actions will be treated as a separate allegation, subject to procedures described in section _c_. Alternatively, the VPAA/DoF may determine that the original and newly discovered actions should be considered as a single matter, in which case the original review will be aborted and the combined matter treated as a new allegation, subject to procedures described in section _c_.\n\n_e. Conflicts of interest_  \nIn the interests of maintaining the integrity of the procedures described above, the VPAA/DOF, provost, president, the faculty ombudsperson, and any member of the Promotions Committee will recuse themselves from their roles in these procedures whenever they are charged with professional misconduct in their capacity as a faculty member or face some other conflict of interest.\n\nIf a member of the Promotions Committee is recused, the Reappointments Committee will select one of its own members to fulfill the roles of the member of the Promotions Committee under investigation in the procedures described above.\n\nIf the faculty ombudsperson is recused, the alternate ombudsperson will fulfill the role of the faculty ombudsperson in the procedures described above.\n\nIf an administrator or the president is charged with professional misconduct, then the Board of Trustees will conduct its own hearing to consider whether they retain their administrative position. If the Board rescinds the administrative position and the president or administrator is a tenured faculty member, then they will subsequently be subject to the procedures described in section *c.iv*.\n\n_f. Teaching Ineffectiveness as Possible Grounds for Termination_  \nTenure cannot be an impregnable barrier against sanctions for general teaching performance that is judged by competent authorities to be below a minimally acceptable level for the College. The chairs of departments, and the VPAA/DoF bear direct responsibility to take steps to correct seriously defective teaching. If a chair has reason to believe that a faculty member's teaching performance is seriously defective, the faculty member must be directly approached on this matter and be given a written statement outlining the problems. This statement will be prepared by the chair after appropriate consultation with other members of the faculty, professionals outside the College, current students, and alumni. The chair also will consult with the VPAA/DoF in all such matters and a copy of all correspondence with the faculty member will be filed in the Office of the VPAA/DoF.\n\nWhen there is reason to believe that a faculty member's teaching is seriously defective, the chair will not only advise the faculty member of this judgment, but will meet with them to see if a program can be developed that will correct the problems as perceived. The College will attempt to assist in this program.\n\nIf serious problems persist over a period of years and it is the judgment of the chair in consultation with appropriate colleagues that the faculty member has made no successful effort to correct the situation, they may recommend to the VPAA/DoF that action be initiated for a misconduct review as set forth in sectionc. In the case of misconduct related to teaching ineffectiveness, the VPAA/DoF cannot act without departmental recommendation.\n\n_g.  Administrative Procedures regarding Potential Violations of the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy and the Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking._\n\nReports related to faculty misconduct that, if proven, may constitute violations of the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy and/or the Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking (henceforth referred to as the “SMDVS Policy”) will be investigated according to the procedures outlined in the applicable policy.  As described in both policies, the Human Relations Officer (HRO) will provide to the VPAA/DoF a determination as to whether any policy violations have occurred.  In SMDVS proceedings, complainants and respondents will have an equal right to be accompanied to any related meeting or hearing by an advisor of their choice; to simultaneous notification of the result of a proceeding; and to timely access to information that will be used during related meetings and hearings.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Recommended Sanctions other than Termination for Cause</span>\n\nIf the HRO determines that a policy violation has occurred, and the VPAA/DoF, in consultation with the provost, determines that the severity of the violation does not rise to the level of termination for cause, a sanction (i.e., written reprimand, mandatory counseling, or salary freeze) will be imposed by the VPAA/DoF within 5 days of receipt of the HRO’s final finding, after any applicable appeals of the finding have been completed. This time period may be shorter or longer depending on the circumstances, including but not limited to any contractual rights of the parties. Interim measures to protect the parties may be taken while the sanction is being decided, as outlined in the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy or the SMDVS Policy. The complainant or the respondent may appeal the sanction following the procedures described in the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy or the SMDVS Policy, as appropriate.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Recommendation of Termination for Cause</span>\n\nIf the HRO determines that a policy violation has occurred, and the VPAA/DoF determines, in consultation with the provost, that the severity of the violation is such that termination for cause should be considered, the sanction will be determined by the Promotions Committee.  Interim measures to protect the parties may be taken while the sanction is being decided, as outlined in the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy or the SMDVS Policy. In arriving at a recommended sanction in such cases, the Promotions Committee will follow the procedures for a Misconduct Review (_Faculty Misconduct,_ section _d_), with the exception that the purpose of the Misconduct Review is the determination of a sanction, not the determination of a finding.  The complainant has the same rights to participate in any such Misconduct Review as the respondent. In arriving at a determination of a sanction, the Promotions Committee will not conduct an additional investigation, but will base their decision on the HRO’s finding while also taking the complainant’s and respondent’s sanction statements into consideration. The Promotions Committee will have 14 days to conduct the Misconduct Review and recommend a sanction and/or other actions as appropriate to the provost.  The provost will have 7 days to respond to the Promotions Committee’s recommendation, at which point both the Promotions Committee’s recommendation and the provost’s recommendation will be presented to the Board of Trustees.\n\nIf the Promotions Committee and provost do not agree on a recommended outcome, then the Board will conduct a misconduct hearing.  In arriving at a recommended sanction in such cases, the Board Hearing Panel will follow the procedures for a Misconduct Hearing (Faculty Misconduct, section d.v), with the exception that the purpose of the hearing is the determination of a sanction, not the determination of a finding.  The complainant has the same rights to participate in any such Misconduct Hearing as the respondent.  The Board Hearing Panel, if convened, will have 30 days to arrive at a decision.\n\nIf the Promotions Committee and provost agree on a recommended outcome, then the provost will report the allegation and recommended outcome to the Board of Trustees.  If the Board accepts the provost’s recommendation, then that recommendation will be enacted.  Either the complainant or the respondent can, in this case, challenge the sanction by requesting a misconduct hearing by a Hearing Panel of the Board of Trustees.  If the Board rejects the provost’s recommendation, the Board will conduct a Misconduct Hearing.  The Board Hearing Panel will follow the procedures for a Misconduct Hearing (Faculty Misconduct, section _d.v._), with the exception that the purpose of the hearing is the determination of a sanction, not the determination of a finding.  The complainant has the same rights to participate in any such misconduct hearing as the respondent. The Board Hearing Panel, if convened, will have 30 days to arrive at a decision.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Appealing the Sanction</span>\n\nThe complainant and respondent each have the right to challenge the sanction as described in the appeals procedures in the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy or the SMDVS policy, as appropriate.\n","excerpt":"a. General Principles In determining whether a faculty member’s actions constitute professional misconduct, and in determining any penalties…","html":"<p><em>a. General Principles</em></p>\n<p><em>In determining whether a faculty member’s actions constitute professional misconduct, and in determining any penalties for faculty misconduct, up to and including termination, faculty members, administrators, and Trustees will act in accordance with the following principles:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Faculty members are expected to conform to all ethical standards of the profession, such as those enumerated in the American Association of University Professors’ <em>Statement on Professional Ethics</em> (<a href=\"https://www.aaup.org/report/statement-professional-ethics\">https://www.aaup.org/report/statement-professional-ethics</a>).</li>\n<li>All members of the faculty, whether tenured or not, are entitled to academic freedom as set forth in the 1940 <em>Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure</em>, formulated by the Association of American Colleges and Universities and the American Association of University Professors. Exercises of academic freedom, including the expression of dissent or unpopular opinions, do not constitute faculty misconduct, and cannot incur a penalty.</li>\n<li>The principle of presumed innocence applies: until the process of review is complete, the faculty member is presumed innocent.</li>\n<li>The grounds for a finding of faculty misconduct and imposition of penalties must be specific and concrete.</li>\n<li>Criminal activity may constitute faculty misconduct where such activity could reasonably be seen to substantially compromise a faculty member's ability to carry out his or her responsibilities as a teacher, scholar, and contributor to the functioning and governing of the College.  Civil disobedience, non-violent protest, and expression of opinions, even where such activities result in civil or criminal penalties, do not amount to faculty misconduct under this section.  Crimes involving violence or deliberate and consequential dishonesty, on the other hand, may constitute misconduct.</li>\n<li>The principle of proportionality applies: the penalty must be commensurate with the severity of the misconduct in question. Only the most serious violations of a faculty member’s responsibilities as a teacher, scholar, and contributor to the functioning and governance of the college, especially actions that pose an imminent threat to the safety of others and the flagrant interference with the efforts of colleagues and students to exercise their rights of free inquiry and expression, can be considered as adequate cause for termination.</li>\n<li>Considerations of political opinions, race, creed, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, legally recognized forms of disability, or economic considerations—e.g., relating to the individual's salary level, length of contract—are absolutely prohibited in determining grounds for misconduct or assigning penalties for misconduct.</li>\n<li>The principle of equal treatment should apply: instances of misconduct that are similar in nature and magnitude should be met with penalties that are similar in nature and magnitude, regardless of the identities of the faculty members involved.</li>\n<li>Public perceptions and media representations of a faculty member should play no role in determining if misconduct has occurred, or in assessing any penalties that result from misconduct.</li>\n<li>Faculty participation is central to the hiring and promotion of our colleagues. The principle of self-governance requires that the faculty be significantly involved in the review of a colleague accused of professional misconduct.</li>\n<li>While the Board of Trustees has ultimate authority in matters involving faculty misconduct, in keeping with the principle of faculty self-governance, the Board will give considerable deference to the recommendations of the faculty and administration regarding faculty misconduct. In the event that the Board disagrees with the faculty’s or administration’s recommendations, the Board will provide a substantive written justification for its decision.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>b. Definitions of Lesser Misconduct, Grounds for Termination, and Violations of the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy and/or the Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking</em></p>\n<p>There are three categories of professional misconduct: lesser misconduct, grounds for termination, and misconduct associated with violations of the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy and/or the Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking. Additionally, faculty members may face penalties (including termination) for teaching ineffectiveness, even if no misconduct has occurred. All allegations of misconduct or teaching ineffectiveness will be considered in the context of the general principles described in section <em>a</em> above. In all instances of alleged misconduct or teaching ineffectiveness, the faculty member will be secure in his or her right to a fair and impartial hearing.</p>\n<p><em>i. Lesser misconduct.</em> In keeping with the principle of proportionality, some professional misconduct does not constitute sufficient grounds for termination of employment. Such “lesser misconduct” includes, but is not limited to, violations of the Employee Code of Conduct that do not satisfy the specific grounds for termination set forth in section <em>b.ii.</em>, and violations of the principles of faculty conduct set forth in section <em>a</em> that do not satisfy the specific grounds for termination set forth in section <em>b.ii</em>.</p>\n<p><em>ii. Grounds for termination.</em> Faculty on appointment for any term, including tenure, may have their appointment terminated prior to the specifications of the appointment only by special action of designated and appropriate College authorities with adequate cause and according to the procedures described below. As per the proportionality principle, termination <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"> </span> for any reason may be undertaken only in the most exceptional circumstances and only for the most compelling reasons. Tenure is a primary protection for academic freedom and contributes to the stability necessary for the development of the College. At the same time, tenure is not simply a guarantee of appointment until retirement. Specific serious offenses may result in termination for cause. A continued pattern of teaching performance that is judged to be below minimally acceptable standards may also result in termination.</p>\n<p>The following are considered as grounds for termination:</p>\n<p>(a) Flagrant and deliberate violations of the rules and procedures of the Middlebury College faculty; persistent failure to carry out specified teaching assignments as these are determined by a department or by the Curriculum Committee of the College. Action cannot be taken under the latter clause against a faculty member whose academic directions have not changed but who is a member of a department that has undertaken new directions and therefore has developed new needs.</p>\n<p>(b) Severe abuse of professional authority; deliberate coercion of others; deliberate suppression of the freedom of thought necessary in an academic community; patterns of behavior that fundamentally compromise a faculty member's ability to carry out his or her responsibilities as a teacher, scholar, and contributor to the functioning and governance of the College.</p>\n<p>(c) Actions that are willfully destructive of College facilities or pose an imminent threat to the safety of others.</p>\n<p>(d) Serious criminal conduct as defined in <em>General Principles</em> section <em>a. v.</em><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"></span></p>\n<p>(e) Teaching ineffectiveness. (Procedures defined below in section <em>f</em>.)</p>\n<p><em>iii. Violations of the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy and/or the Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking</em>. Reports of misconduct that, if proven, would violate the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy and/or the Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking will be investigated according to the procedures described in those policies.  Sanctions, including, potentially, termination for cause and other sanctions listed in section <em>g</em>. of this policy, will be determined according to the procedures that are described below in that section.</p>\n<p><em>c. Administrative Procedures regarding Allegations of Lesser Misconduct and/or Grounds for Termination</em></p>\n<p><em>i.</em> When an allegation of professional misconduct has been made, the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty (VPAA/DoF) will make a preliminary inquiry and will discuss the matter with those administrative officers he or she deems appropriate. If the VPAA/DoF concludes that the alleged misconduct, were it to be substantiated, might constitute professional misconduct, and therefore that further inquiry is warranted, then they will meet in confidence with the accused faculty member to discuss the alleged violation. The faculty member and the VPAA/DoF may each invite an <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"> </span> adviser of their choice, typically a tenured faculty colleague, to assist them, or to act as counsel. Under all circumstances, the VPAA/DoF will report the details of the case to the provost.</p>\n<p>In consultation with the VPAA/DoF, the provost will then propose one of three possible outcomes:</p>\n<p>(a)    If the provost finds no misconduct, then the faculty member will incur no penalty, contingent on the approval of the Board of Trustees as described in section <em>c.iv.</em></p>\n<p>(b)   If the provost finds grounds only for lesser misconduct (as defined in <em>b.i.</em>), then the provost will recommend a penalty less than termination, with subsequent procedures described in section <em>c.ii.</em></p>\n<p>(c)    If the provost finds grounds for termination (as defined in <em>b.ii.</em>), then the case will be directed to the Promotions Committee for a misconduct review, as described in section <em>d.</em></p>\n<p>The VPAA/DoF will inform the complainant(s) in writing whether the provost has recommended to the Board that the matter be dropped, whether a lesser penalty will be pursued, or whether a misconduct review will be initiated.</p>\n<p><em>ii.</em> If the provost finds that lesser misconduct has occurred, then, in consultation with the VPAA/DoF, the provost will recommend a penalty less than termination. If the faculty member accepts the recommended penalty, then that penalty is enacted, contingent on approval by the Board of Trustees as described in section <em>c.iv</em>. Alternatively, the faculty member may reject the recommended penalty, which initiates a misconduct discussion as described in section <em>c.iii</em>.</p>\n<p><em>iii.</em> If the faculty member rejects a recommendation for a penalty less than termination in the process described in <em>c.ii.</em>, then the VPAA/DOF, provost, and faculty member will engage in a misconduct discussion with the aim of finding a mutually acceptable outcome. If the three parties agree on an outcome within 30 days, then that agreement shall be enacted, contingent on the final approval by the Board of Trustees as described in section <em>c.iv</em>. In this case, the Board will be informed of the provost’s initial penalty proposal and the outcome agreed upon in the misconduct discussion. In all other cases, the matter will be turned over to the Promotions Committee for a misconduct review, as described in section <em>d</em>. In this case, the Promotions Committee will be informed of the provost’s initial penalty proposal.</p>\n<p><em>iv.</em> If the faculty member, VPAA/DoF, and provost agree on either no penalty or on a penalty less than termination, and the Promotions Committee has not reviewed the matter, the provost will report the allegation and recommended outcome to the Board of Trustees. This report will not divulge the names of the faculty member or of any individuals who participated in these deliberations.</p>\n<p>If the Board accepts the provost’s recommendation, then that recommendation will be enacted. If the Board rejects the provost’s recommendation, then the Board will identify factors that either the VPAA/DoF and/or the provost has failed to consider, and that the Board deems relevant to the case. The Board will communicate these factors to both the Promotions Committee and the provost, and the Promotions Committee will initiate the misconduct review procedures described in section d. Both the Promotions Committee and the provost will address in their written findings (as described in section <em>d.ii.</em>) their assessment of the specific factors that the Board of Trustees has recommended that they consider. If either the Promotions Committee or the provost disagrees with the Board as to the interpretation and importance of these considerations, they will include the grounds of this disagreement in these written findings.</p>\n<p><em>d. Misconduct Review Procedures</em></p>\n<p><em>i.</em> Following a provost’s recommendation for a misconduct review, as described in section <em>c.i</em>(c), a misconduct discussion not resulting in a mutually acceptable outcome as described in section <em>c.iii.,</em> or a Board of Trustees recommendation for a misconduct review, as described in section <em>c.iv.</em>, the case will be turned over to the Promotions Committee. In such cases, the VPAA/DoF will promptly inform the faculty member, in writing, of the identity of the person or persons who initiated the charge, the allegation of misconduct being considered, and the sources of any information about the case. The statement given to the faculty member will be framed with due concern for the rights of the parties involved. The person or persons who initiated the charge will be informed that their identity is being revealed to the accused faculty member and that the Promotions Committee is considering the matter. Middlebury College will protect from retaliation anyone who makes a good faith effort to appropriately disclose perceived professional misconduct. However, the College reserves the right to distinguish between retaliation and ongoing performance management related to the \"whistleblower.\"  See the College's Whistleblower policy for further elaboration.</p>\n<p>Once the Promotions Committee has begun the misconduct review, the VPAA/DoF will make available to the committee all information pertaining to the matter that he or she possesses. The provost and the VPAA/DoF will cooperate with the committee in any inquiries the committee deems necessary. The VPAA/DoF will not otherwise participate in the Promotions Committee's proceedings or deliberations. The faculty member will be given fair opportunity to prepare and present their defense and will be permitted to call upon an adviser of their choice, typically a tenured faculty colleague, to assist them, or to act as counsel.  In the course of the review, the faculty member will have an opportunity to confront witnesses against them.</p>\n<p>The faculty ombudsperson will attend all proceedings of the Promotions Committee that incorporate interviews or testimony in the case. The Promotions Committee will also keep the ombudsperson informed of the committee's work. The ombudsperson will keep the provost informed of the committee's work. A professional reporter will transcribe any interviews and testimony heard by the committee. All parties must agree to the content of the transcript before it becomes the official record of the proceedings.  The faculty member and the provost will each have full access to all records of interviews and testimony at the committee's proceedings as these records become available.</p>\n<p><em>ii.</em> After a full review of the case, the Promotions Committee will recommend one of three possible outcomes:</p>\n<p>(a) If the Promotions Committee finds no grounds for misconduct, it will recommend that the faculty member incur no penalty.</p>\n<p>(b) If the Promotions Committee finds only grounds for lesser misconduct, it will recommend a penalty less than termination.</p>\n<p>(c) If the Promotions Committee finds grounds for termination, it will recommend that the faculty member be terminated for cause.</p>\n<p>The Promotions Committee will inform the faculty member and provost in writing of its findings and recommendations.</p>\n<p>The provost will consider the recommendation of the Promotions Committee. Within 14 days of receiving this recommendation, except where exigent circumstances require otherwise, the provost will present his or her own recommendation, orally and in writing, to the faculty member and to the Promotions Committee. The written findings of the Promotions Committee and the provost will be provided to the Board of Trustees. These reports will not divulge the names of the faculty member or of any individuals who participated in the review.</p>\n<p>If the provost and the Promotions Committee recommend the same outcome, then that outcome will be enacted, contingent on approval by the Board of Trustees, as described in section <em>d.iv.</em> Otherwise, they will initiate a misconduct discussion as described in section <em>d.iii</em>.</p>\n<p><em>iii.</em> If the provost rejects the Promotions Committee’s recommendation in the process described in <em>d.ii.</em>, then the Promotions Committee and provost will engage in a misconduct discussion with the aim of finding a mutually acceptable outcome. If the two parties agree on an outcome within 14 days, then that agreement shall be enacted, contingent on approval by the Board of Trustees as described in section <em>d.iv</em>. In this case, the Board will be informed of the Promotion Committee’s and provost’s initial penalty proposals and the outcome agreed upon in the misconduct discussion. In all other cases, the matter will be turned over to the Board of Trustees for a misconduct hearing, as described in section <em>d.v</em>. In this case, the Board will be informed of the Promotion Committee’s and provost’s initial penalty proposals.</p>\n<p><em>iv.</em> If the Promotions Committee and provost agree on a recommended outcome, then the provost will report the allegation and recommended outcome to the Board of Trustees. This report will not divulge the names of the faculty member or of any individuals who participated in these deliberations.</p>\n<p>If the Board accepts the provost’s recommendation, then that recommendation will be enacted. The faculty member may otherwise appeal to the Board of Trustees who will conduct a Misconduct Hearing as described in section <em>d.v.</em> If the Board rejects the provost’s recommendation, then the Board will conduct a misconduct hearing as described in section <em>d.v.</em></p>\n<p><em>v.</em> In circumstances that require the Board of Trustees to conduct a misconduct hearing, the Board will establish a Hearing Panel of at least three of its members to consider the case. The work of the Hearing Panel will include a review of all of the documentation of the case; a meeting with the faculty member who was charged; an interview with the Promotions Committee; an interview with the provost; and all further investigations and interviews that the Hearing Panel deems necessary. The faculty member will be given fair opportunity to prepare and present his or her defense, and will be permitted to call upon an adviser of their choice, typically a tenured faculty colleague, to assist them, or to act as counsel. If, in the course of its investigation, the Board identifies factors that the Promotions Committee or provost has failed to consider and that the Board deems relevant to the case, the Board will communicate these factors to both the Promotions Committee and the provost, allowing each to register any disagreements as to the interpretation and importance of these factors. A professional reporter will produce a verbatim transcript of the proceedings of the Hearing Panel. The faculty member will have full access to all records of the proceedings of the Hearing Panel. The work of the Hearing Panel must be completed within 60 days except where exigent circumstances require otherwise. If the Hearing is not completed within 60 days, the accused faculty member will be informed of the delay, the reason for it, and an expected completion date.</p>\n<p>After the Hearing Panel completes its work, the Board of Trustees will decide on three possible outcomes:</p>\n<p>(a)    If the Hearing Panel finds no grounds for misconduct, the faculty member will incur no penalty.</p>\n<p>(b)   If the Hearing Panel finds only grounds for lesser misconduct, it will impose a penalty less than termination.<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"></span><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"></span></p>\n<p>(c)    If the Hearing Panel finds grounds for termination, then the faculty member’s employment will be terminated with cause, and the faculty member will not be offered any subsequent employment at the College.</p>\n<p>The Board’s decision is final and will be carried out by the provost.</p>\n<p><em>vi.</em> From the moment the provost finds grounds for professional misconduct until the time when the Board of Trustees reaches its final decision, the faculty member may end the proceedings by resigning.  When the charge against the faculty member is based in whole or in part on deliberate harm to others (e.g., harassment), however, the faculty member will not be permitted to take early retirement or resign effective at a later date in exchange for the charges being dropped.  If the faculty member chooses to resign, the resignation must take effect immediately.</p>\n<p><em>vii.</em> Whenever the Promotions Committee has conducted a misconduct review in which either it, the provost, or the Board has recommended that a faculty member’s employment be terminated, it will, at the last faculty meeting of the term in which the review has taken place, report to the voting members of the faculty: (1) the general category (according to Grounds for Termination <em>b</em>.<em>ii.</em> (a)-(e) above) of the allegations brought, and (2) whether the committee recommended that the faculty member’s employment be terminated. This report will not divulge the names of the faculty member or of any individuals having participated in the review and will be entered into the records of the faculty. If a faculty member ends a misconduct review by resigning, the cessation of the review and the reason for its cessation will be reported to all individuals having participated in the review, and to the faculty, in the manner described above.</p>\n<p><em>viii.</em> If at any point in the course of a misconduct review, it is found that the faculty member engaged in additional or more severe misconduct, but these actions were not the original basis for the misconduct review, the VPAA/DoF will be informed of the additional evidence and/or allegations. The VPAA/DoF may determine that the original misconduct review will continue for the original actions and that the more recently discovered actions will be treated as a separate allegation, subject to procedures described in section <em>c</em>. Alternatively, the VPAA/DoF may determine that the original and newly discovered actions should be considered as a single matter, in which case the original review will be aborted and the combined matter treated as a new allegation, subject to procedures described in section <em>c</em>.</p>\n<p><em>e. Conflicts of interest</em><br>\nIn the interests of maintaining the integrity of the procedures described above, the VPAA/DOF, provost, president, the faculty ombudsperson, and any member of the Promotions Committee will recuse themselves from their roles in these procedures whenever they are charged with professional misconduct in their capacity as a faculty member or face some other conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>If a member of the Promotions Committee is recused, the Reappointments Committee will select one of its own members to fulfill the roles of the member of the Promotions Committee under investigation in the procedures described above.</p>\n<p>If the faculty ombudsperson is recused, the alternate ombudsperson will fulfill the role of the faculty ombudsperson in the procedures described above.</p>\n<p>If an administrator or the president is charged with professional misconduct, then the Board of Trustees will conduct its own hearing to consider whether they retain their administrative position. If the Board rescinds the administrative position and the president or administrator is a tenured faculty member, then they will subsequently be subject to the procedures described in section <em>c.iv</em>.</p>\n<p><em>f. Teaching Ineffectiveness as Possible Grounds for Termination</em><br>\nTenure cannot be an impregnable barrier against sanctions for general teaching performance that is judged by competent authorities to be below a minimally acceptable level for the College. The chairs of departments, and the VPAA/DoF bear direct responsibility to take steps to correct seriously defective teaching. If a chair has reason to believe that a faculty member's teaching performance is seriously defective, the faculty member must be directly approached on this matter and be given a written statement outlining the problems. This statement will be prepared by the chair after appropriate consultation with other members of the faculty, professionals outside the College, current students, and alumni. The chair also will consult with the VPAA/DoF in all such matters and a copy of all correspondence with the faculty member will be filed in the Office of the VPAA/DoF.</p>\n<p>When there is reason to believe that a faculty member's teaching is seriously defective, the chair will not only advise the faculty member of this judgment, but will meet with them to see if a program can be developed that will correct the problems as perceived. The College will attempt to assist in this program.</p>\n<p>If serious problems persist over a period of years and it is the judgment of the chair in consultation with appropriate colleagues that the faculty member has made no successful effort to correct the situation, they may recommend to the VPAA/DoF that action be initiated for a misconduct review as set forth in sectionc. In the case of misconduct related to teaching ineffectiveness, the VPAA/DoF cannot act without departmental recommendation.</p>\n<p><em>g.  Administrative Procedures regarding Potential Violations of the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy and the Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking.</em></p>\n<p>Reports related to faculty misconduct that, if proven, may constitute violations of the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy and/or the Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking (henceforth referred to as the “SMDVS Policy”) will be investigated according to the procedures outlined in the applicable policy.  As described in both policies, the Human Relations Officer (HRO) will provide to the VPAA/DoF a determination as to whether any policy violations have occurred.  In SMDVS proceedings, complainants and respondents will have an equal right to be accompanied to any related meeting or hearing by an advisor of their choice; to simultaneous notification of the result of a proceeding; and to timely access to information that will be used during related meetings and hearings.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Recommended Sanctions other than Termination for Cause</span></p>\n<p>If the HRO determines that a policy violation has occurred, and the VPAA/DoF, in consultation with the provost, determines that the severity of the violation does not rise to the level of termination for cause, a sanction (i.e., written reprimand, mandatory counseling, or salary freeze) will be imposed by the VPAA/DoF within 5 days of receipt of the HRO’s final finding, after any applicable appeals of the finding have been completed. This time period may be shorter or longer depending on the circumstances, including but not limited to any contractual rights of the parties. Interim measures to protect the parties may be taken while the sanction is being decided, as outlined in the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy or the SMDVS Policy. The complainant or the respondent may appeal the sanction following the procedures described in the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy or the SMDVS Policy, as appropriate.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Recommendation of Termination for Cause</span></p>\n<p>If the HRO determines that a policy violation has occurred, and the VPAA/DoF determines, in consultation with the provost, that the severity of the violation is such that termination for cause should be considered, the sanction will be determined by the Promotions Committee.  Interim measures to protect the parties may be taken while the sanction is being decided, as outlined in the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy or the SMDVS Policy. In arriving at a recommended sanction in such cases, the Promotions Committee will follow the procedures for a Misconduct Review (<em>Faculty Misconduct,</em> section <em>d</em>), with the exception that the purpose of the Misconduct Review is the determination of a sanction, not the determination of a finding.  The complainant has the same rights to participate in any such Misconduct Review as the respondent. In arriving at a determination of a sanction, the Promotions Committee will not conduct an additional investigation, but will base their decision on the HRO’s finding while also taking the complainant’s and respondent’s sanction statements into consideration. The Promotions Committee will have 14 days to conduct the Misconduct Review and recommend a sanction and/or other actions as appropriate to the provost.  The provost will have 7 days to respond to the Promotions Committee’s recommendation, at which point both the Promotions Committee’s recommendation and the provost’s recommendation will be presented to the Board of Trustees.</p>\n<p>If the Promotions Committee and provost do not agree on a recommended outcome, then the Board will conduct a misconduct hearing.  In arriving at a recommended sanction in such cases, the Board Hearing Panel will follow the procedures for a Misconduct Hearing (Faculty Misconduct, section d.v), with the exception that the purpose of the hearing is the determination of a sanction, not the determination of a finding.  The complainant has the same rights to participate in any such Misconduct Hearing as the respondent.  The Board Hearing Panel, if convened, will have 30 days to arrive at a decision.</p>\n<p>If the Promotions Committee and provost agree on a recommended outcome, then the provost will report the allegation and recommended outcome to the Board of Trustees.  If the Board accepts the provost’s recommendation, then that recommendation will be enacted.  Either the complainant or the respondent can, in this case, challenge the sanction by requesting a misconduct hearing by a Hearing Panel of the Board of Trustees.  If the Board rejects the provost’s recommendation, the Board will conduct a Misconduct Hearing.  The Board Hearing Panel will follow the procedures for a Misconduct Hearing (Faculty Misconduct, section <em>d.v.</em>), with the exception that the purpose of the hearing is the determination of a sanction, not the determination of a finding.  The complainant has the same rights to participate in any such misconduct hearing as the respondent. The Board Hearing Panel, if convened, will have 30 days to arrive at a decision.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Appealing the Sanction</span></p>\n<p>The complainant and respondent each have the right to challenge the sanction as described in the appeals procedures in the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy or the SMDVS policy, as appropriate.</p>"},"6301878f-bf83-52ae-af32-b82fa6ac1e8c":{"id":"6301878f-bf83-52ae-af32-b82fa6ac1e8c","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/faculty/research-policies","title":"C.10.

As a condition of employment, all new and rehired employees must properly complete, sign, and date the first section of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Form I-9 by his or her first day of employment. The employee's documents must be reviewed and section 2 completed within three business days of the first day of work. An employee who does not properly complete the I-9 form within the legally required timeframe will not be permitted to continue to work until the form is completed.\n\n**Personnel Records and Changes in Personal Status**\n\nEmployees are responsible for taking an active role in keeping their records current and accurate. Notification to Human Resources of any changes in personal status is critical. Such information is necessary to ensure correct coverage and, if appropriate, deductions for taxes, medical insurance, life insurance, etc. Incorrect or outdated information may affect employee benefits and the ability of the College to make the appropriate contacts in an emergency. The accuracy of an employee's entry in the College directory depends on the accuracy of that employee's files. Some changes that should be reported promptly include:\n\n- Name\n- Home address\n- Telephone number\n- Marital status\n- Names and social security numbers of dependents\n- Birth dates of dependents\n- Changes in dependent(s) status\n- Changes in emergency contact information\n- Beneficiary designations for benefit plans, such as retirement plan, life insurance, etc.\n\nEmployees may review the personal information in their personnel files by setting up an appointment with a representative of Human Resources. One business day notice is required.\n\nFailure to notify Human Resources of changes or falsification of records may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.\n\n**Categories of Employment**\n\nA series of employment categories identify the type of position held by each staff and faculty member. The employee's position type should be included in the letter notifying him or her of employment.\n\nIf at any time, an employee is unclear about the type of appointment s/he holds, the employee should seek clarification from either the department head or Human Resources. See [section 3, Employee Benefits](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/benefits) for benefit eligibility information.\n\n_Faculty members_ teach students. Faculty titles include: professor, associate professor, assistant professor, instructor, visiting assistant professor, visiting instructor, lecturer, visiting lecturer, and assistant in instruction.\n\n_Staff members_ are hired to perform non-teaching duties in support of the College's academic mission.\n\nMiddlebury College classifies faculty and staff members according to the chart below. The primary basis for classification is committed hours for staff and instructional units for faculty. Committed hours are regularly scheduled and budgeted hours assigned to a specific position. Regardless of the number of hours actually worked, on-call positions have no committed hours. Human Resources will work collaboratively with managers to determine the classification of each position.\n\n**Employee Group Classifications -

Before being placed on the payroll, new employees must complete the necessary federal forms at the Human Resources office.</p>\n<p><strong>Form I-9</strong></p>\n<p>The College, in accordance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, is committed to employing only those applicants authorized to work in the United States. As a condition of employment, all new and rehired employees must properly complete, sign, and date the first section of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Form I-9 by his or her first day of employment. The employee's documents must be reviewed and section 2 completed within three business days of the first day of work. An employee who does not properly complete the I-9 form within the legally required timeframe will not be permitted to continue to work until the form is completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Personnel Records and Changes in Personal Status</strong></p>\n<p>Employees are responsible for taking an active role in keeping their records current and accurate. Notification to Human Resources of any changes in personal status is critical. Such information is necessary to ensure correct coverage and, if appropriate, deductions for taxes, medical insurance, life insurance, etc. Incorrect or outdated information may affect employee benefits and the ability of the College to make the appropriate contacts in an emergency. The accuracy of an employee's entry in the College directory depends on the accuracy of that employee's files. Some changes that should be reported promptly include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Home address</li>\n<li>Telephone number</li>\n<li>Marital status</li>\n<li>Names and social security numbers of dependents</li>\n<li>Birth dates of dependents</li>\n<li>Changes in dependent(s) status</li>\n<li>Changes in emergency contact information</li>\n<li>Beneficiary designations for benefit plans, such as retirement plan, life insurance, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Employees may review the personal information in their personnel files by setting up an appointment with a representative of Human Resources. One business day notice is required.</p>\n<p>Failure to notify Human Resources of changes or falsification of records may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>\n<p><strong>Categories of Employment</strong></p>\n<p>A series of employment categories identify the type of position held by each staff and faculty member. The employee's position type should be included in the letter notifying him or her of employment.</p>\n<p>If at any time, an employee is unclear about the type of appointment s/he holds, the employee should seek clarification from either the department head or Human Resources. See <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/benefits\">section 3, Employee Benefits</a> for benefit eligibility information.</p>\n<p><em>Faculty members</em> teach students. Faculty titles include: professor, associate professor, assistant professor, instructor, visiting assistant professor, visiting instructor, lecturer, visiting lecturer, and assistant in instruction.</p>\n<p><em>Staff members</em> are hired to perform non-teaching duties in support of the College's academic mission.</p>\n<p>Middlebury College classifies faculty and staff members according to the chart below. The primary basis for classification is committed hours for staff and instructional units for faculty. Committed hours are regularly scheduled and budgeted hours assigned to a specific position. Regardless of the number of hours actually worked, on-call positions have no committed hours. Human Resources will work collaboratively with managers to determine the classification of each position.</p>\n<p><strong>Employee Group Classifications -

The College also adheres to DOT requirements for those employees who hold a commercial driver's license as part of their position responsibilities for travel within the state. Such employees are subject to the controlled substance and alcohol testing rules.\n\n**Policy Statement:** A driver is forbidden to consume or be under the influence of alcohol within four hours of going on duty, while on duty, or while driving, and up to 8 hours following an accident or until the employee undergoes a post-accident test, whichever occurs first.   A driver on duty is forbidden to possess, be under the influence of, or use any Schedule I drug substance, including any amphetamine or formulation of an amphetamine, narcotics or derivatives, or any other substance that makes driving unsafe.\n\nAll employees who hold a commercial driver's license as part of their position responsibilities for travel within the state are required to participate in controlled substance/alcohol testing. This includes testing for pre-employment, random, post-accident, reasonable suspicion, and return to duty testing and follow up testing.  For these employees, participation in the testing program is a condition of employment at Middlebury College.\n\nNote that the ability to use a CDL license may be affected by violations incurred driving a private vehicle.  Employees with a CDL license must notify their supervisor within 24 hours of conviction of a violation in ANY vehicle.  Employees must also notify their supervisor if their regular driver's license is suspended.  Employees who fail to notify the College as requested may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Controlled Substances Testing</span>\n\nTesting is performed by analyzing a driver's urine specimen. All urine specimens are analyzed for marijuana (THC metabolite), cocaine, amphetamines, opiates (including heroin), and phencyclidine (PCP).\n\nWhen contacted for testing, the driver will provide a urine specimen, which will be subdivided into two bottles. If the analysis of the primary specimen indicates the presence of illegal, controlled substances, the driver has 72 hours to request the split specimen be sent to another DHHS-certified laboratory for analysis.\n\nIf a driver has a positive drug test result, the driver will be interviewed by a Medical Review Officer (MRO) to determine if the positive drug test resulted from the unauthorized use of a controlled substance. If the MRO determines that unauthorized use has occurred, the driver will be removed from safety-sensitive duty, and cannot return to such duties until s/he has been evaluated by a substance abuse professional, has complied with recommended rehabilitation, and has a negative result on a return-to-duty drug test. Follow-up testing to monitor the driver's continued abstinence from drug use will be conducted.\n\nUse of vehicles requiring a CDL is prohibited while using controlled substances, except when the use is at the instruction of a physician who has advised the driver that the substance does not adversely affect the ability to safely operate a Commercial Motor Vehicle.\n\nDrivers who engage in prohibited controlled substance conduct will be immediately removed from safety functions, and cannot return until they have been evaluated by a substance abuse professional and complied with any treatment recommendations. Drivers will also be subject to disciplinary action, up and including termination.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Alcohol Testing</span>\n\nTesting is performed using the driver's breath.\n\nDrivers who have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 when tested just prior to, during, or immediately following performing safety-sensitive functions will be removed from performing such duties for 24 hours.\n\nUse of vehicles requiring a CDL is prohibited while using alcohol, while having a breath alcohol concentration of 0.04 percent or greater as indicated by an alcohol breath test, and/or within four hours after using alcohol.\n\nDrivers who engage in prohibited alcohol conduct will be immediately removed from safety functions, and cannot return until they have been evaluated by a substance abuse professional and complied with any treatment recommendations. Drivers will also be subject to disciplinary action, up and including termination.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Procedures</span>\n\nIn all cases, the privacy of the employee and the confidentiality of testing records and results will be strictly maintained by Middlebury College.  The integrity of the test process will be maintained.  Test results will be attributed to the correct driver.\n\n<table border=\"0\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"125\">\n\n**Physical Examinations**\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"432\">\n\n*   An employee holding a CDL as part of his/her position description will submit to a medical examination every 2 years.

Risk factors can be controlled by adjusting a workstation, varying work positions, reducing continuous or repetitious actions, and periodically stretching throughout the day. The EHS Office can conduct an ergonomic assessment on your work area (office workstation or other areas) or on a specific task you perform as part of your job and recommend improvements.\n\nFurther information concerning the ergonomics program can be accessed at:  \n[https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/ehs/Ergo](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/ehs/Ergo)\n\n**Workers' Compensation**\n\nIn compliance with state laws, the College provides comprehensive workers' compensation (WC) insurance coverage at no cost to employees.

The RTWTDP is designed to provide a temporary work assignment allowing the employee to transition back into the position held prior to the onset of the injury or illness. The transitional position will be carefully designed to be appropriate for the skills, knowledge, and capabilities of the recovering employee so that the work can be accomplished safely. The RTWTDP is limited to employees with temporary illnesses or injuries. Transitional duty positions, when available, are always temporary and are assigned for a period of time usually not to exceed 12 weeks. In addition, employees participating in the program must have appropriate documentation from a medical care professional that evaluates their capability to work.

Any CTO over the maximum will be automatically moved to SLR.\n\nAt any other time of year there is no maximum accrual.\n\n## CTO Pay-Out on Termination of Eligible Employment\n\nAccrued, unused CTO will be paid out at 100% of the employee's current rate of pay upon termination of employment or when an employee moves to a position that is not eligible to accrue CTO. (SLR is not paid out.)\n\nIn all cases of separation, final CTO payout may be withheld until keys, ID cards, and other College property are returned to the supervisor or the Human Resources Office.\n\n## CTO Use\n\n### General CTO guidelines\n\nThe combination of CTO and regular worked hours each pay period should equal an employee's regular scheduled hours. Part-time employees may not enter CTO in excess of their scheduled hours. Employees not on a formal leave status must use CTO to cover absences from work unless their supervisor and/or Human Resources has granted an unpaid absence. Employees may not choose to take time unpaid.\n\nPlease refer to the [Personal Leave of Absence Policy](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/time-away/personal-leave) for unpaid absences in excess of a full pay period.\n\n### Non-exempt staff CTO Use\n\nAs required by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), non-exempt staff must record all work time. When non-exempt staff members use CTO they should record each hour or portion of an hour away from work as CTO.\n\n### Exempt Staff CTO Use\n\nAs per the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), exempt staff are paid on a salaried basis. This dictates that their pay does not vary with regard to the number of hours worked. Exempt staff often work in excess of their normal scheduled hours and do not receive overtime or any additional pay beyond their salary. Therefore, occasional brief absences from work of less than a day will not be deducted from the CTO banks of exempt staff with the exception of approved leaves of absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). CTO will be recorded in full day increments when an exempt staff member is away from work for the entire day. Exempt staff are expected to maintain regular work schedules, and deviations from these schedules requires management approval. In situations of a reduced schedule or repeated or regular absences, managers and staff should make arrangements to enter CTO to adjust for absences. The use of half days may be a useful alternative in these cases. Issues related to productivity, meeting position responsibilities and appropriate office hours are performance matters and will not be managed through CTO use.\n","excerpt":"In order to provide flexibility to employees in the use of time off, Middlebury College utilizes combined time off (CTO).

Departments will establish practices for providing notice of absences from work and for scheduling time away.</p>\n<h2>Eligibility</h2>\n<p>Most full-time regular staff employees and benefits-eligible part-time staff employees accrue CTO, beginning in the first pay period in which the employees are paid. (See Handbook section <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee\">2.3 Basic Information about Employment at Middlebury College</a> for definitions of regular full-time and benefits-eligible part-time.)</p>\n<p>Faculty, temporary, seasonal, part-time employees in positions budgeted for less than 1,000 hours per year, as well as a small number of special jobs, are not eligible for CTO.</p>\n<h2>Accruals</h2>\n<p>CTO accrues in hours after each biweekly payroll is run.

Any CTO over the maximum will be automatically moved to SLR.</p>\n<p>At any other time of year there is no maximum accrual.</p>\n<h2>CTO Pay-Out on Termination of Eligible Employment</h2>\n<p>Accrued, unused CTO will be paid out at 100% of the employee's current rate of pay upon termination of employment or when an employee moves to a position that is not eligible to accrue CTO. (SLR is not paid out.)</p>\n<p>In all cases of separation, final CTO payout may be withheld until keys, ID cards, and other College property are returned to the supervisor or the Human Resources Office.</p>\n<h2>CTO Use</h2>\n<h3>General CTO guidelines</h3>\n<p>The combination of CTO and regular worked hours each pay period should equal an employee's regular scheduled hours. Part-time employees may not enter CTO in excess of their scheduled hours. Employees not on a formal leave status must use CTO to cover absences from work unless their supervisor and/or Human Resources has granted an unpaid absence. Employees may not choose to take time unpaid.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/time-away/personal-leave\">Personal Leave of Absence Policy</a> for unpaid absences in excess of a full pay period.</p>\n<h3>Non-exempt staff CTO Use</h3>\n<p>As required by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), non-exempt staff must record all work time. When non-exempt staff members use CTO they should record each hour or portion of an hour away from work as CTO.</p>\n<h3>Exempt Staff CTO Use</h3>\n<p>As per the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), exempt staff are paid on a salaried basis. This dictates that their pay does not vary with regard to the number of hours worked. Exempt staff often work in excess of their normal scheduled hours and do not receive overtime or any additional pay beyond their salary. Therefore, occasional brief absences from work of less than a day will not be deducted from the CTO banks of exempt staff with the exception of approved leaves of absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). CTO will be recorded in full day increments when an exempt staff member is away from work for the entire day. Exempt staff are expected to maintain regular work schedules, and deviations from these schedules requires management approval. In situations of a reduced schedule or repeated or regular absences, managers and staff should make arrangements to enter CTO to adjust for absences. The use of half days may be a useful alternative in these cases. Issues related to productivity, meeting position responsibilities and appropriate office hours are performance matters and will not be managed through CTO use.</p>"},"40f12ab3-20d1-5d74-8edb-0ca05a785d94":{"id":"40f12ab3-20d1-5d74-8edb-0ca05a785d94","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/time-away/holidays","title":"4.4 Holidays","body":"\nThere are two types of holidays: Regular Holidays and Floating Holidays.

Human Resources is responsible for ensuring compliance with such laws, including the determination of exempt and non-exempt status. Direct questions concerning exempt and non-exempt status of positions to Human Resources.\n\nExecutive, administrative, and professional positions that meet specific federal criteria are exempt positions and will be paid a fixed salary based on a standard number of hours worked per pay period. No overtime is paid for hours worked in excess of a standard 40-hour week.\n\nPositions that do not meet the federal exempt criteria are non-exempt positions that receive overtime pay at a rate of one and one-half times the regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in one week. The regular hourly rate is defined as total pay, that is base pay for the week plus other pay such as shift differentials, divided by the total number of hours worked in that week.

Some positions, however, by the nature of their responsibilities and the demands of the academic year, require irregular and heavy work schedules. All employees may be asked to work extra hours as needed. Overtime assignments will be distributed as equitably as practicable to all employees qualified to perform the required work.

Failure to receive prior approval will be addressed as a performance issue.\n\nEach biweekly pay period consists of two Monday through Sunday work weeks. Each work week stands alone for the purposes of determining overtime. Averaging over any period beyond the seven day work week is prohibited. The first 40 hours worked, or a combination of worked hours, CTO, SLR, and paid holidays are paid at straight time. Any time worked after the 40th hour is paid as overtime.\n\n_Example:_ Monday, eight hours; Tuesday, eight hours; Thursday, eight hours; Friday, four hours; Saturday, eight hours; Sunday, eight hours for a total of 44 hours. The overtime hours are the last four hours worked on Sunday, not the four hours worked on Friday. Time cards and paper and electronic timesheets must be coded accordingly to ensure proper payment of overtime.\n\nAn exception to charging the last hours over 40 as overtime will be made in cases where an employee holds two non-exempt positions, such as a full-time primary job and a second on-call position, and has recorded hours in more than one of the positions. In that case overtime will be charged to the second position for any hours over 40 in a workweek.\n\n_Compensatory time:_ Compensatory time (Comp time) is not permitted. This is the practice of saving or holding extra hours worked to be exchanged for time off or paid at a later time, to avoid payment of overtime.

Special Provisions of Appointment (associate status, release from contract)","body":"\n_a. Associate Appointment_\n\ni. Purpose  \nAppointment with associate status is designed to allow particular individuals to reduce their teaching responsibilities at the College for limited periods without interrupting their normal employment. The reasons for requesting associate status may include, for example, the need to fulfill familial obligations, the wish to engage more fully in scholarly or artistic projects (or other forms of professional development), or the wish to reduce one's teaching obligations for a few years before retirement.\n\nii. Conditions  \nWith the exception of colleagues nearing retirement (that is, those colleagues who have passed their 60th birthday), faculty on associate status are normally expected to be in residence at the College for the entire academic year and to fulfill normal advising and service responsibilities. Colleagues on associate status who have passed their 60th birthday by September 1 of the academic year in question are required to be in residence during either the fall or spring term. Other faculty members who wish to be excused from normal advising and service responsibilities must apply for a regular leave of absence through the Educational Affairs Committee.\n\n(a) Requests for associate status for purposes of professional development will, if granted, be treated as leaves of absence. Handbook guidelines will govern the eligibility of colleagues granted associate status for future leaves of absence. Tenure-track faculty normally will not be eligible to request associate status for the purpose of professional development until they have undergone a review for tenure. They may request associate status before the tenure review for personal reasons (e.g., familial obligations), however. In the event that a tenure-track faculty's request is approved, the tenure review schedule may be extended one semester for each year on associate status.\n\n(b) Associate status may be requested for a maximum of three consecutive years and, normally, for no more than a total of six years during the period prior to the faculty member's 60th birthday. After the 60th birthday, faculty may remain on associate status for up to five years preceding retirement.\n\n(c) Colleagues on associate status are expected to teach three courses per academic year, maintaining contact hours and enrollments consonant with a 0.6 FTE appointment. Those courses normally will be spread out over the entire academic year, but the administration also will consider requests for associate status that call for teaching two courses in either the fall or spring term and one course taught in Winter Term. If it is beneficial to the department or program curriculum, colleagues may be permitted to teach three courses solely in either the fall or spring term. Normally, a colleague who is on associate status will receive 60% of their full-time salary.\n\n(d) Colleagues on associate status will be eligible for travel and research support from the FPDF.\n\n(e) Requests for associate status of whatever sort will be governed by a goal of maintaining from year to year, and over the years, a student/faculty ratio of 9:1\\. It should be understood that commitment to a multi-year associate status arrangement may affect the leave patterns of other full-time faculty, both within and beyond the department directly affected by the request.\n\niii. Appointment Procedures  \nA faculty member on regular appointment at any rank may request associate appointment for limited periods of time ranging from a year to a maximum of three years before resuming regular teaching responsibilities. Such requests will be made to the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty (VPAA/DoF). The deadline for requesting associate appointment in any given academic year is September 1 of the year prior.\n\n(a) Those requests that seek time off for purposes of professional development will be considered by the Educational Affairs Committee (EAC) as requests for leave without pay. A letter from the department chair and the chairs of any affected programs must accompany each request. This letter should comment upon the proposal and present a strategy for replacing the colleague making the request. Time off or reduced teaching in order to complete a terminal degree will not be considered professional development.\n\n(b) Those requests that seek time off for purposes other than professional development will be considered by the VPAA/DoF or designee, in consultation with the Promotions Committee, and a recommendation will be advanced by them to the president. The EAC will be consulted where staffing implications are involved. A letter from the department chair and the chair of any affected program must accompany each request. This letter should comment upon the proposal and present a strategy for replacing the colleague making the request.\n\n(c) The president, after appropriate consultation with the faculty member's department, the Promotions Committee, and the EAC, will decide on the request. If associate appointment is agreed to, a formal letter of understanding setting forth the conditions of the appointment will be sent by the president (or designate) to the individual faculty member and the department chair. Instructors and assistant professors who move to associate appointment retain the term of appointment current at the time that change is granted. A faculty member who moves to associate appointment after the fourth year of appointment but prior to the review for tenure, and who subsequently fails to be given a tenured appointment, is normally not eligible for continuation as an assistant professor beyond the one-year terminal appointment stated in General Provisions 1.e.iv. Tenured faculty who move to associate appointment retain tenure and are reviewed on the normal schedule.\n\n_b. Release from Contractual Obligations_\n\ni. The contract of appointment of a member of the faculty of Middlebury College may not be terminated by the College prior to the expiration of the period of appointment except for adequate cause as specified in section c. below or under extraordinary circumstances because of serious financial emergency.\n\nii. The contract of a member of the faculty may be terminated if the faculty member himself or herself requests release. In order to receive consideration, the request must be presented in writing to the VPAA/DoF, and it should call for an effective date coinciding with the concluding date of the academic year so as to avoid disruption of the work of the College. The request should be dispatched early enough to be in the VPAA/DoF's hand no later than the July 1 preceding the effective date if the faculty member concerned is a professor or associate professor; no later than August 1 if they are an assistant professor or instructor or lecturer. Waiver of these dates may be granted by the VPAA/DoF upon specific request in writing if, in their judgment, compliance with them would impose hardship upon the faculty member.","excerpt":"a.

The number of compensable travel hours depends on whether the trip is one day only or overnight, and whether the travel time takes place within normal or outside of normal work hours.\n\nTravel time will be paid at the employee’s regular hourly rate, or overtime rate when the total number of hours worked is in excess of 40 in a pay week (Monday through Sunday), in accordance with Middlebury College's normal overtime policy.\n\n**Same Day Travel**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">  \nFrom/To The Normal Workplace</span>:  For non-exempt employees who report to the normal work site prior to traveling, all time spent traveling between work locations during a single workday is considered work time and as such will be paid time.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">From/To Home:</span> When an employee departs directly from his/her home for work-related travel (that is, begins travel without first going to the normal work location), and when an employee returns directly home from work-related travel (without first reporting to the work location) normal commuting time should be deducted from the travel time.\n\n**Overnight Travel**  \nWhen travel keeps the employee away from home overnight any portion of authorized travel time that takes place _within normal work hours_ on any day of the week, including Saturday and Sunday, is treated as work hours.\n\nTo calculate worked time when an employee is away from home overnight the employee should only report time that cuts across normal work hours.  When traveling _to_ a location, worked time will include time from when the employee leaves home until the employee reaches his/her destination, _less the employee’s normal commute time_. The destination is either the hotel or the work site (whichever location the employee travels directly to). If the employee is returning home _from_ a remote location, the destination is the employee’s regular worksite.  If the employee travels directly from the remote worksite to home, then the travel time is calculated as the time from the remote worksite to home, _less the employee’s normal commute time._\n\nWhen an employee travels between two or more time zones, the time zone associated with the point of departure should be used to determine the number of work hours and whether or not the travel falls within normal work hours.\n\nOnce the employee has reached the away work destination travel between the hotel and worksite is considered normal commuting time and is not eligible for compensation unless the employee is asked to, or volunteers to, drive another employee to the worksite, in which has the time would be considered work time.\n\nFree time, time spent sleeping, eating meals, and other personal activities is not considered work time and is not compensated.\n\n### Exempt (Salaried) Employees\n\nExempt (salaried) employees are not paid on the basis of hours worked, and therefore there is no pay adjustment for time spent traveling outside of regular hours.  In certain cases exempt employees may be able to “flex” their schedules when traveling, but such flex time is not intended as compensatory time and is subject to approval by the employee’s manager.\n\n### Travel Expenses\n\nEmployees are reimbursed for out-of-pocket travel expenses allowable under Middlebury College’s [Travel, Entertainment and Expense Policy and Procedures](https://www.middlebury.edu/system/files/media/Travel%2C%20Entertainment%2C%20and%20Expense%20Policy%20and%20Procedures_1.pdf).\n\n_Note:  This policy applies to employees whose travel is incidental to their work (that is, employees who are traveling somewhere to do their work); it is not intended to apply to those employees whose work is the travel itself.  For example, this policy does not apply to employees who are engaged to drive vans transporting students or other employees or to employees  engaged to transport materials between campus locations; all such driving time is regular work time, not travel time._\n","excerpt":"Definition Travel time is the time spent actively traveling between the normal work site and another location where work will be performed…","html":"<h3>Definition</h3>\n<p>Travel time is the time spent actively traveling between the normal work site and another location where work will be performed.  Commuting time to and from the normal workplace is not considered travel time under this policy.</p>\n<h3>Non-exempt (Hourly) Employees</h3>\n<p>Occasionally non-exempt (hourly) College employees are required to travel within the United States and/or abroad.

Academic Honesty, the Honor Code, and Related Disciplinary Policies","body":"\n<span>_Last updated August 22, 2017_</span>\n\n**A. Introduction**\n\nAs an academic community devoted to the life of the mind, Middlebury requires of every student complete intellectual honesty in the preparation and submission of all academic work.\n\n**B. Academic Honesty**\n\n**_1\\. Definitions of Prohibited Acts_**\n\nAny student action that does not reflect complete intellectual honesty in the preparation and submission of all academic work is prohibited.  Although the definitions below are provided to offer clarity, they are not intended to be exhaustive. Faculty members may define additional actions as Academic Honesty violations for their particular departments and courses as appropriate.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">a. Plagiarism</span>  \nPlagiarism is intentionally or unintentionally representing the ideas, research, language, creations, or inventions of another person as one's own. In written work and oral and artistic presentations, even a single sentence or key phrase, idea, image, or sound taken from the work of another without specific citation of the source and quotations around verbatim language constitutes plagiarism. It makes no difference whether the source is a student, a professional, or a source with no clear designated author.\n\nAlthough it does not involve reproducing language verbatim, paraphrasing is the close restatement of another's idea using approximately the language and/or structure of the original. Paraphrasing without acknowledgment of authorship is also plagiarism and is as serious a violation as an unacknowledged quotation.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">b. Cheating</span>  \nCheating is defined as giving, receiving, or attempting to give or receive any aid unauthorized by the instructor for any assigned work. On assignments other than exams, academic assistance from the staff of the Center for Teaching, Learning and Research (CTLR) and from Middlebury’s professional librarians is considered authorized aid unless an assignment or course clearly indicates otherwise.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">c. Duplicate Use of Work</span>  \nAny work submitted to meet the requirements of a particular course is expected to be original work completed for that course. Students who wish to incorporate any portion of their own previously developed work into a new assignment must consult with the involved faculty members to establish appropriate expectations and parameters. The same work, or substantially similar work, may not be used to meet the requirements of two different courses.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">d. Falsifying Data  \n</span>The collection and analysis of data are fundamental aspects of many types of research. It is the researcher’s responsibility to ensure that data are recorded and documented accurately. Fabrication, misrepresentation or falsification of data, and practices that significantly deviate from those that are commonly accepted in the academic community, are prohibited.  “Data” includes but is not limited to laboratory research, human subjects research, and fieldwork.\n\n**_2\\. Student Responsibilities_**\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Expectations</span>: All assignments should be the work of the individual student, unless otherwise directed by the instructor. Students are responsible for ensuring that their work does not involve plagiarism, cheating, or duplication of their own previous work. Students with questions relating to correct citation of sources, proper recognition of collaborative work on assignments, paraphrasing, authorized aid, utilization of their own prior work, or any other aspect of an academic assignment should consult with the professor for whom they are preparing work. Ignorance of the nature of plagiarism or of Middlebury’s policies may not be offered as a mitigating circumstance.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Honor Code Pledge</span>: The Honor Code pledge reads as follows: \"I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this assignment.\" It is the responsibility of the student to write out in full, adhere to, and sign the Honor Code pledge on all examinations, research papers, and laboratory reports. Faculty members reserve the right to require the signed Honor Code pledge on other kinds of academic work.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Community Accountability</span>: Academic integrity is the foundation of a healthy intellectual community. One individual’s intellectual dishonesty erodes that foundation and negatively affects all community members. Therefore, in addition to adhering to the Academic Honesty Policy themselves, the student-written Constitution of the Undergraduate Honor Code states that “Any member of the College community (student, faculty, or administrator) who is aware of a case of academic dishonesty is morally obligated to report it to the professor or the judicial affairs officer.”\n\n**_3\\. Faculty Responsibilities_**\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Expectations</span>: At the beginning of each term, professors s are strongly encouraged to discuss and include on their syllabus their expectations of academic honesty as they relate to the course and to Middlebury’s policies They are also encouraged to orient students to issues of academic integrity, source attribution, and authorized resources that may be particular to their academic field and to the assignments of the class. In the absence of specific verbal or written instruction from a faculty member, the language of this Academic Honesty Policy applies.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Honor Code Pledge</span>: Faculty reserve the right to require the signed Honor Code pledge before grading any assigned academic work.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Community Accountability</span>: Middlebury faculty members who suspect a student of violating Middlebury’s Academic Honesty Policy are expected to contact a judicial affairs officer to discuss their concerns.<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"></span>\n\n**<a name=\"ughonor\" id=\"ughonor\"></a>C. Undergraduate Honor System**\n\n**Constitution of the Undergraduate Honor System**\n\nAll assigned academic work is conducted under the terms of the [Undergraduate Honor System](https://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife-older-delete-pending/doc/honorcode), which follows in full:\n\n**Preamble**\n\nThe students of Middlebury College believe that individual undergraduates must assume responsibility for their own integrity on all assigned academic work. This constitution has been written and implemented by students in a community of individuals that values academic integrity as a way of life. The Middlebury student body, then, declares its commitment to an honor system that fosters moral growth and to a code that will not tolerate academic dishonesty in the College community.\n\n**Article I: Honor System**\n\n**a**. Before enrolling in Middlebury College each student must agree to abide by and uphold this honor system. Additional commitments to the honor system should be part of orientation week activities.\n\n**b**. The judicial affairs officer shall prepare a statement for all incoming students describing the aims and operation of the academic honor system. The judicial affairs officer will be responsible for an orientation session during orientation week so that all new students fully understand the system.\n\n**c**. The Academic Judicial Board will meet annually at the beginning of the fall term with deans from the Office of the Dean of the College, the Community Judicial Board, and the Judicial Appeals Board to review the honor system and to orient new members.\n\n**Article II: Examination Procedure**\n\n**a.** Only authorized materials may be used during an examination.\n\n**b.** No proctors will be present during examinations, unless specific authorization has been given by the dean of the College.\n\n**c.** The dean of the College may grant an instructor permission to proctor an examination in his or her course when the instructor has communicated to the dean of the College that she or he has a concern that students will cheat in examinations in the course. Authorization will apply to the remainder of the semester.\n\ni) Communication of concern may take the form of an e-mail to the dean of the College.\n\nii) Instructors who have concerns about cheating and wish to proctor must make a formal announcement to the class both in class and in e-mail form at least 24 hours prior to the examination. The dean of the College must be copied on the announcement e-mail.\n\niii) Students may register complaints or concerns about the method of proctoring with the dean of the College.\n\n**d.** When an instructor's presence in the exam is required because of the nature of the exam (e.g., slides), the instructor should receive permission from the dean of the College and notify the class in advance.\n\n**e.** The instructor will remain in the examination room for no more than 15 minutes after the start of an examination. He or she may return during the examination to check on any further problems that students may have with examination questions or general procedure, only if he or she announces his or her intention to do so at the beginning of the examination. Instructors will remain in the general area for questions for the duration of the examination period.\n\n**f.** During the examination each student will have complete freedom of action providing he or she does not interfere with the work of others. Except in the case of take-home examinations, no examination papers will be taken from the room except to consult with the instructor.\n\n**Article III: Violations of the Honor Code, Procedures, and Disciplinary Actions**\n\n**a.** Any member of the College community (student, faculty, or administrator) who is aware of a case of academic dishonesty is morally obligated to report it to the professor or the judicial affairs officer.\n\n**b.** Those who cheat are morally obliged to report their own offense to the professor or the judicial affairs officer.\n\n**c.** Alleged violations will be handled according to the academic disciplinary policies of the current Middlebury College Handbook.\n\n**d.** For cases that are heard by the Academic Judicial Board, if seven members of the Board are present, six votes are needed for a decision of guilt. If six members are present, five votes are needed.\n\n**e.** Any infraction of the honor system is normally punishable by suspension from the College. However, the penalty may be modified when, in the opinion of the Academic Judicial Board, conclusive reasons warrant such action.\n\n**f.** Should the accused be found not guilty, all records of the proceeding will be destroyed.\n\n**g.** Right of Appeal: A student found guilty of an offense will have the right of appeal to the Judicial Appeals Board in all cases.\n\n**h.** All deliberations of the Academic Judicial Board concerning violations of the honor system will be conducted in confidence.\n\n**Article IV: Amendment Procedures and Review Committee**\n\n**a.** This constitution (Undergraduate Honor System: Preamble and Articles I-IV) may be amended by a referendum in which two-thirds of all students who are currently registered for classes vote, and in which two-thirds of those voting support the change, subject to ratification by the faculty. Community Council, the faculty, or the Honor Code Review Committee can suggest changes to other aspects of the judicial system by making recommendations. Those recommendations would eventually need to be ratified by the Community Council, which forwards them to Faculty Council for review, and then to the faculty for final approval.\n\n**b**. At least every fourth year, a committee consisting of two faculty members, two students (one of whom will be the current co-chair of the Academic Judicial Board), and a dean from the Office of the Dean of the College shall examine the honor system and its operation and make any appropriate recommendations for revision to the faculty and the Community Council. Faculty members will be selected by the Faculty Council, the second student member by the Student Government Association, and the dean from the Office of the Dean of the College.\n","excerpt":"Last updated August 22, 2017 A.

Degree Programs & Projects","body":"\n**<a name=\"first\" id=\"first\"></a>A. First-year Student Seminars and College Writing Courses**\n\nFirst-year seminars are thematic courses that approach an area of intellectual inquiry from a perspective that attempts to make connections among a number of the traditional disciplines. Normally, a first-year seminar has an enrollment of no more than 15 students for each faculty member in the seminar. The first-year seminars have an intensive writing component. All entering students register for one first-year seminar. The instructor of this seminar is the first-year faculty adviser for all the students enrolled in the course. Normally, first-year seminars do not satisfy departmental major requirements. They may, however, satisfy distribution requirements. Exceptions to this pattern are published in the catalog of first-year seminars.  After successfully completing a first-year seminar, every student must complete by the end of the fourth semester or as determined by the student's major department or program, at least one course designated as a College writing course (CW). Students are responsible for completing both college writing requirements prior to graduation, and are strongly advised to fulfill their second CW credit _before_ they begin their final semester at Middlebury. A College writing course should not be taken concurrently with a first-year seminar, and if taken concurrently, will not satisfy this requirement.\n\n**<a name=\"distribution\" id=\"distribution\"></a>B. Distribution Requirement**\n\nAll students must complete two sets of distribution requirements:\n\n(a) academic categories, and\n\n(b) cultures and civilizations.\n\nCourses that count toward the major or a minor may be used to satisfy distribution requirements. Winter term courses, Summer Study courses, first-year seminars, and College writing courses may also be used to satisfy distribution requirements.\n\nIndependent study courses (0500 and above) do not qualify for distribution requirements.\n\nStudents must take at least one course in seven of eight academic categories described below. Single courses can be listed with two distribution categories. A student may count a single course in no more than one academic category requirement. Courses taken under the Pass/D/Fail option may not be used to satisfy distribution, College Writing, First Year Seminar, or cultures and civilizations requirements.\n\n**1\\. Academic Categories**\n\n**a. Literature (LIT)**\n\nLiterature has been a central form of expression for many societies. Analysis and appreciation of the literary text give students insight into the minds and lives of other human beings, both their own cultural predecessors and people of different traditions, and into the process whereby human experience is imaginatively transformed into art. By studying literature in English and in other languages, students also sharpen their ability to express their own ideas with grace and precision.\n\n**b. The Arts (ART)**\n\nThe understanding of the history, theory, and practice of the arts is an integral part of a liberal arts education. Courses in this category either emphasize the creative process through the making and performing of actual works of art (ranging from paintings and sculptures to plays, dances, creative writing, film/video, and musical compositions) or study the place of such works of art within a particular historical, cultural, or aesthetic context.\n\n**c. Philosophical and Religious Studies (PHL)**\n\nCourses in this category examine philosophical systems and religious traditions from a variety of viewpoints, including analytical, systematic, historical, sociological, anthropological, and phenomenological perspectives. Some courses deal with specific philosophical problems or theological issues; others trace the history of philosophy or of religious traditions; still others examine philosophical schools of thought or religious traditions during specific periods of history.\n\n**d. Historical Studies (HIS)**\n\nHistory is that branch of knowledge that seeks to account for the diverse ways in which human beings in different cultures and societies have all met and responded to temporal change. Courses in this area study the development of societies and cultures over time.\n\n**e. Physical and Life Sciences (SCI)**\n\nCourses in this category study inductive and deductive processes of science. Emphasis is on the methods used to gather, interpret, and evaluate data critically, and the placement of this information into a larger context. Fundamental principles of each discipline are discussed in a manner that illustrates the evolving relationship of science, technology, and society.\n\n**f. Deductive Reasoning and Analytical Processes (DED)**\n\nCourses in this category deal with one or more of the following: (a) basic principles of reasoning and the axiomatic method; (b) statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting data; (c) key mathematical concepts; (d) abstract symbolic manipulation or reasoning.\n\n**g. Social Analysis (SOC)**\n\nThis category deals with the analysis of the individual in society. Courses in this area involve the systematic study of human behavior and the processes and results of human interaction through organizations and institutions, both formal and informal. Social analysis can be undertaken from a variety of perspectives: inductive (using data to make generalizations about human behavior), deductive (using principles to search for and to develop new theories), and normative (using values to recognize important questions and to evaluate alternative answers).\n\n**h. Foreign Language (LNG)**\n\nSpeaking, listening, reading, and writing in a language other than one's own exercise and expand the mind. Because of the close interdependence between language and culture, study of a foreign language helps one gain insights into other societies and ultimately one's own. Courses in this category include many, but not all, of those taught in a foreign language or which focus on texts in a foreign language.\n\n**<a name=\"cultures\" id=\"cultures\"></a>2\\. Cultures and Civilizations Requirement**\n\n**<span>For students who entered the College prior to Fall 2017:</span>**\n\nMiddlebury College believes that students should have broad educational exposure to the variety of the world's cultures and civilizations, where these terms are broadly understood to intersect with geography, history, ethnicity, gender and other factors. Issues pertaining to culture are thus integral to most of the academic disciplines represented in the curriculum. Accordingly, Middlebury students are required to successfully complete four distinct courses to fulfill the cultures and civilizations requirement by taking a course in each of the following four categories:\n\na. **AAL**: courses that focus on some aspect of the cultures and civilizations of Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and the Caribbean.\n\nb. **CMP**: courses that focus on the process of comparison between and among cultures and civilizations, or courses that focus on the identity and experience of separable groups within cultures and civilizations.\n\nc. **EUR**: courses that focus on some aspect of European cultures and civilizations.\n\nd. **NOR**: courses that focus on some aspect of the cultures and civilizations of northern America (United States and Canada)\n\nA single course may be listed as fulfilling either AAL, EUR, or NOR (as recommended by the course instructor and determined by the Curriculum Committee).  Courses that satisfy CMP may also carry one of the regional area designations, however a student may not count one of these courses toward both the CMP and AAL/EUR/NOR requirements. A student may also count the same course toward both an academic category requirement, and one of the cultures and civilization<span>s</span> requirements. Courses that count toward the major and the minor, winter term courses, summer study courses, and first-year student seminars may be used to satisfy the cultures and civilizations requirement.\n\nCollege Board Advanced Placement credits may not be used to satisfy distribution or cultures and civilizations requirements.\n\n**<span>For students who enter the College in Fall 2017 or later:</span>**\n\nMiddlebury College believes that students should 1) have educational exposure to the variety of the world's cultures and civilizations, where these terms are broadly understood to intersect with geography, history, ethnicity, gender and other factors, and 2) engage critically with sameness, difference, culture, and perspective. These goals are integral to most of the academic disciplines represented in the curriculum.\n\nAccordingly, each Middlebury student is required to complete successfully four courses to fulfill the cultures and civilizations requirement. Specifically, every student takes at least one course in each of at least three of the following regions, focusing on some aspect of the cultures and civilizations of that region.\n\na. **SOA**: South and Southeast Asia, including the Pacific\n\nb. **NOA**: North Asia including China, Korea, Japan and the Asian steppes\n\nc. **MDE**: Middle East and North Africa\n\nd. **SAF**: Sub-Saharan Africa\n\ne. **EUR**: Europe\n\nf. **AMR**: the Americas\n\nplus one Comparative (**CMP**) course, focused on the process of comparison between and among cultures and civilizations, or on the identity and experience of separable groups within cultures and civilizations.\n\nA single course may be listed as fulfilling one of the regional categories (SOA, NOA, MDE, SAF, EUR, AMR; as recommended by the course instructor and determined by the Curriculum Committee).  Courses that satisfy CMP may also carry one of the regional area designations, however a student may not count one of these courses toward both the CMP and regional requirements. A student may count the same course toward both an academic category requirement, and one of the cultures and civilization<span>s</span> requirements. Courses that count toward the major and the minor, winter term courses, summer study courses, and first-year student seminars may be used to satisfy the cultures and civilizations requirement.\n\nCollege Board Advanced Placement credits may not be used to satisfy distribution or cultures and civilizations requirements.\n\n**<a name=\"major\" id=\"major\"></a>C. Major Programs of Study**\n\nStudents choose one of the following programs of study:\n\n(a) 1 major (departmental, joint, or interdisciplinary**)\n\n(b) 1 major (departmental, joint, or interdisciplinary**), 1 minor\n\n(c) 1 departmental major, 2 minors\n\n(d) 2 majors* (_either 2 departmental or one departmental and one interdisciplinary**_), no minor.\n\n*_A student who has declared two majors will have to choose to complete only one major should scheduling conflicts occur._  \n**_Majors considered interdisciplinary include: American Studies; Black Studies; Environmental Studies; Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies; International and Global Studies; International Politics and Economics; Molecular Biology and Biochemistry; and Neuroscience._\n\nA major requires a minimum of 10 fall and spring semester courses. Students may take no more than 16 fall and spring semester courses and, in addition, no more than two winter term and summer study courses, combined, in a major department or program (one of which may be senior work).\n\nAll students must officially declare a major by the end of the third semester. Any student who wishes to complete a second major must officially declare by the end of the fourth semester of study. After the fourth semester, students wishing to add a second major, or change majors, must petition and gain approval from the new department or program to ensure that the student can complete the major by the end of the eighth semester.\n\nSome highly structured programs, particularly those involving study in the foreign languages or the natural sciences, are facilitated by a declaration of major by the end of the second semester.\n\nA department may define standards for the admission of students to its major program. Students who do not meet these standards may be denied admission or may be admitted provisionally, pending demonstration of their qualifications for advanced work in the department.\n\nIn addition to specific courses required for a major, cognate courses may be recommended to further the student's particular academic interests or intentions. Departments offer different opportunities for senior work, adjusted both to the nature of the field and to students' needs. Students should consult the descriptions of senior work under each department or program for details on the available senior work offerings.\n\nMajor/Adviser Declaration/Change Forms are available in the Office of the Registrar and each of the Commons offices. The declaration Form must be signed by the chair of the major department or program (or designee).\n\n**D. Change of Major**\n\nTo change a major, students must petition and gain approval from the new department or program (or designee) to ensure that they can complete the major by the end of the eighth semester. Upon gaining approval of that plan, the student must submit a Change of Major Form to the Office of the Registrar, signed by the adviser and chair (or designee) of the proposed major department or program.\n\n**E. Joint Majors**\n\nTo complete a joint major, a student is required to:\n\n1\\. Secure formal approval from advisers and chairs (or designees) in both departments or programs. To gain that approval, the student is required to work with the chairs (or designees) of both departments or programs on an academic program for completion of the proposed joint major. The minimum requirements agreed upon, and the overall program must be submitted in writing with the signature of the two department or program chairs (or designees) to the Office of the Registrar.\n\n2\\. Complete a senior program which combines both majors and is agreed upon by the advisers and department or program chairs (or designees) involved. That senior work may include or exclude normal expectations regarding independent work and general examinations as appropriate.\n\nA student declaring a joint major may not declare any other major.\n\n**F. Two Majors**\n\nTo complete two separate majors _(either 2 departmental or one departmental and one interdisciplinary_), a student is required to:\n\n1\\. Formally declare both majors according to procedures stated above, with the approval of the chairs (or designees) of both departments or programs.\n\n2\\. Complete all the requirements for the major in each department or program. A course will meet the requirements of more than one major for the same student if that specific course is listed by number and name, in the departments' course listings, as specifically required for both majors. Up to two courses implicitly or explicitly listed as generic or categorical requirements of both majors will also meet the requirements of more than one major for the same student. No other courses will be counted as satisfying the requirements of more than one major for the same student except by specific action of the Curriculum Committee and faculty.\n\n3\\. A student declaring two majors may not declare any minors.\n\n**G. Minors**\n\nStudents may elect to complete only one minor if they are undertaking a major that is joint or interdisciplinary. Students may declare up to two minors if they are undertaking a departmental major. A student declaring two majors may not declare any minors.\n\nNormally, all students choosing to declare a minor will do so officially by the end of the Add period of the 7<sup>th</sup> semester of study.\n\nMinors will consist of four to six courses, at least one of which must be at an advanced level.\n\nDepartments and programs may designate configurations of courses that will constitute a minor (or minors) for that department, program, or major.\n\nStudents may not self-design a minor.\n\nFaculty may design interdepartmental minors in those areas of the curriculum in which a major is not offered, subject to approval by the full faculty.\n\nMinors will be listed on students' transcripts.\n\nA course may count toward a student's major or minor, but not toward both. A course counted toward one minor may not be counted toward an additional minor.\n\n**H. Independent Scholar Program**\n\nThe Independent Scholar Program is designed to meet the needs of outstanding students who have clearly defined educational goals that cannot be fulfilled within the framework of a normal departmental or interdisciplinary major. Independent Scholars plan their own curricular programs with the assistance of a faculty adviser. Independent Scholars cannot propose two majors, but can pursue an independent scholar major and one minor. For the 2019-20 academic year, application materials are due to the Curriculum Committee by Monday, October 7, 2019, for fall review; and Monday, February 17, 2020, for spring review.\n\n**Eligibility:** For an application to be considered, a student must be in the sophomore year and have a GPA of 3.5 or higher. If approved, students must fulfill all requirements for the degree using their approved Independent Scholar plan as their major course of study.  Independent Scholar proposals will be evaluated in light of feasibility, academic disciplinary integrity, and demonstrated ability of the student. A successful proposal must articulate a fully developed program of study, must include a methods course, and must demonstrate compellingly that the student’s academic goals cannot be met through existing majors.\n\n**Application process:** To be designated an Independent Scholar, a student must undergo a rigorous approval process overseen by the Curriculum Committee. The process begins with an interview with the dean of curriculum. The student must subsequently prepare and submit a well-defined program to the Curriculum Committee, covering a description of the aim of the program, the independent work, and the courses he or she proposes to comprise the major. The proposal must be accompanied by a written endorsement of a faculty member who is willing and qualified to supervise the student, as well as a statement of support from an alternate faculty member. Faculty member endorsements should describe a student’s readiness to partake in the independent scholar program and should include support for and evidence of the student’s capacity for serious, independent intellectual inquiry. The Curriculum Committee will review all submitted materials, and if warranted, convene a meeting with the candidate and advisers. Final approval rests with the Curriculum Committee.  An applicant whose proposal is denied is entitled to meet with the dean of curriculum or the Curriculum Committee.\n\n**Oversight:** The Curriculum Committee will solicit updates from each Independent Scholar twice a year. Changes to the program must also be submitted to the Curriculum Committee, and the faculty supervisor will cosign all registration materials. The Major Declaration Form and Degree Audit Forms will be signed by both the faculty adviser and dean of curriculum. Students who elect to withdraw from the Independent Scholar Program, or who have their independent scholar status withdrawn, may be allowed, at the discretion of the committee, to graduate in general studies, without a formal major in any department.\n\n**Senior work:** The INDE 0800 is a culminating experience for this program of study. This project brings together the course work the student has completed and incorporates all aspects of the study into one final project. Students applying to be independent scholars are asked to provide an indication of possible INDE 0800 projects at the time that they submit their proposals. Students are able, however, to change the topic of their INDE 0800 project in order to respond to new interests and information acquired during the course of their study.\n\nThe INDE 0800 project is undertaken for one or two terms. Students who wish to be considered for honors must work with a thesis committee. Thesis work most typically follows the procedures for the department most closely related to the project. Others may choose to work with an individual faculty member, usually the student's adviser. The choice of senior project is flexible. For example, with permission from the adviser, a student in the performing arts might want to incorporate a dance performance, musical composition, or some other feature as part of his or her course of study.\n\n**Honors:** In order to be considered for honors, independent scholars normally must meet two criteria: a minimum average of B+ in courses taken towards the major and a minimum grade of B+ on the senior work component. The Registrar's Office oversees the first requirement and will inform the adviser of the student's eligibility. The senior work component must be evaluated by a committee of three faculty members (one of whom, at the adviser's request, may be a faculty member on the Curriculum Committee). Minimum thesis grades for each level of honors are B+ (Honors), A- (High Honors), and A (Highest Honors), but the determination of the appropriate level will be made by the thesis committee.\n\n_For more information about this program, contact Suzanne Gurland, Dean of Curriculum._\n\n**I. 0500 Courses**\n\nThe election of a 0500 project provides an opportunity for individual work in one's field of interest. It is a privilege open to those students with advanced preparation and superior records in their fields; exceptions will be considered by submitting a request to the Curriculum Committee. The 0500 projects in a student's major or minor department must be approved by the department. All 0500 projects proposed outside of the major or minor department must be approved by the chair of the department in which the work is to be done. Students who have earned 17 or fewer credits, not including pre-college testing credits, are normally not permitted to undertake independent work during the Fall and Spring semesters. Exceptions may be considered upon written request to the Curriculum Committee. Students with 8 or more credits may pursue independent work during winter term, or summer study, provided the 0500 course is offered then. A student is limited to four 0500 projects in any discipline, not including winter term or summer study independent projects. Independent study courses are graded on an A-F basis unless special arrangements are made through the dean of curriculum (e.g., occasional independent projects where the instructor decides that the special nature of the course is better suited to honors/pass/fail grading).\n\n**J. Senior Program**\n\nDepartments may organize independent senior work to suit their students' needs under the general principle of encouraging students in independent work.\n\nWhen senior independent work continues through more than one term, a grade of S (satisfactory) or U (unsatisfactory) will be submitted for each term of the project. When a final grade is recorded, the S or U will be converted to whatever final grade is reported.\n\n**In addition to senior independent work, departments may also offer a general examination**. If given, the general examination becomes a fixed degree requirement and may count as one or two course units, as the department shall determine. It may receive a grade separate from that given to the senior independent work.\n\nNormally, general examinations will be held in a student's senior year. In certain cases, students may take general examinations at the end of their junior year. All reexaminations must be taken at Middlebury under the supervision of those in charge of the major program. Prior registration for such examinations must be made with the Commons dean and department chair.\n\nEach department may, at its discretion and in accordance with its requirements, excuse students from final examinations in their major field if they achieve a specified grade in the general examination.\n\nA maximum value of three course units may be assigned for senior work.\n\n_rev. 9/9/19_","excerpt":"A.

Courses taken under the Pass/D/Fail option may not be used to satisfy distribution, College Writing, First Year Seminar, or cultures and civilizations requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Academic Categories</strong></p>\n<p><strong>a. Literature (LIT)</strong></p>\n<p>Literature has been a central form of expression for many societies. Analysis and appreciation of the literary text give students insight into the minds and lives of other human beings, both their own cultural predecessors and people of different traditions, and into the process whereby human experience is imaginatively transformed into art. By studying literature in English and in other languages, students also sharpen their ability to express their own ideas with grace and precision.</p>\n<p><strong>b. The Arts (ART)</strong></p>\n<p>The understanding of the history, theory, and practice of the arts is an integral part of a liberal arts education. Courses in this category either emphasize the creative process through the making and performing of actual works of art (ranging from paintings and sculptures to plays, dances, creative writing, film/video, and musical compositions) or study the place of such works of art within a particular historical, cultural, or aesthetic context.</p>\n<p><strong>c. Philosophical and Religious Studies (PHL)</strong></p>\n<p>Courses in this category examine philosophical systems and religious traditions from a variety of viewpoints, including analytical, systematic, historical, sociological, anthropological, and phenomenological perspectives. Some courses deal with specific philosophical problems or theological issues; others trace the history of philosophy or of religious traditions; still others examine philosophical schools of thought or religious traditions during specific periods of history.</p>\n<p><strong>d. Historical Studies (HIS)</strong></p>\n<p>History is that branch of knowledge that seeks to account for the diverse ways in which human beings in different cultures and societies have all met and responded to temporal change. Courses in this area study the development of societies and cultures over time.</p>\n<p><strong>e. Physical and Life Sciences (SCI)</strong></p>\n<p>Courses in this category study inductive and deductive processes of science. Emphasis is on the methods used to gather, interpret, and evaluate data critically, and the placement of this information into a larger context. Fundamental principles of each discipline are discussed in a manner that illustrates the evolving relationship of science, technology, and society.</p>\n<p><strong>f. Deductive Reasoning and Analytical Processes (DED)</strong></p>\n<p>Courses in this category deal with one or more of the following: (a) basic principles of reasoning and the axiomatic method; (b) statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting data; (c) key mathematical concepts; (d) abstract symbolic manipulation or reasoning.</p>\n<p><strong>g. Social Analysis (SOC)</strong></p>\n<p>This category deals with the analysis of the individual in society. Courses in this area involve the systematic study of human behavior and the processes and results of human interaction through organizations and institutions, both formal and informal. Social analysis can be undertaken from a variety of perspectives: inductive (using data to make generalizations about human behavior), deductive (using principles to search for and to develop new theories), and normative (using values to recognize important questions and to evaluate alternative answers).</p>\n<p><strong>h. Foreign Language (LNG)</strong></p>\n<p>Speaking, listening, reading, and writing in a language other than one's own exercise and expand the mind. Because of the close interdependence between language and culture, study of a foreign language helps one gain insights into other societies and ultimately one's own. Courses in this category include many, but not all, of those taught in a foreign language or which focus on texts in a foreign language.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"cultures\" id=\"cultures\"></a>2. Cultures and Civilizations Requirement</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>For students who entered the College prior to Fall 2017:</span></strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury College believes that students should have broad educational exposure to the variety of the world's cultures and civilizations, where these terms are broadly understood to intersect with geography, history, ethnicity, gender and other factors. Issues pertaining to culture are thus integral to most of the academic disciplines represented in the curriculum. Accordingly, Middlebury students are required to successfully complete four distinct courses to fulfill the cultures and civilizations requirement by taking a course in each of the following four categories:</p>\n<p>a. <strong>AAL</strong>: courses that focus on some aspect of the cultures and civilizations of Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and the Caribbean.</p>\n<p>b. <strong>CMP</strong>: courses that focus on the process of comparison between and among cultures and civilizations, or courses that focus on the identity and experience of separable groups within cultures and civilizations.</p>\n<p>c. <strong>EUR</strong>: courses that focus on some aspect of European cultures and civilizations.</p>\n<p>d. <strong>NOR</strong>: courses that focus on some aspect of the cultures and civilizations of northern America (United States and Canada)</p>\n<p>A single course may be listed as fulfilling either AAL, EUR, or NOR (as recommended by the course instructor and determined by the Curriculum Committee).  Courses that satisfy CMP may also carry one of the regional area designations, however a student may not count one of these courses toward both the CMP and AAL/EUR/NOR requirements. A student may also count the same course toward both an academic category requirement, and one of the cultures and civilization<span>s</span> requirements. Courses that count toward the major and the minor, winter term courses, summer study courses, and first-year student seminars may be used to satisfy the cultures and civilizations requirement.</p>\n<p>College Board Advanced Placement credits may not be used to satisfy distribution or cultures and civilizations requirements.</p>\n<p><strong><span>For students who enter the College in Fall 2017 or later:</span></strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury College believes that students should 1) have educational exposure to the variety of the world's cultures and civilizations, where these terms are broadly understood to intersect with geography, history, ethnicity, gender and other factors, and 2) engage critically with sameness, difference, culture, and perspective. These goals are integral to most of the academic disciplines represented in the curriculum.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, each Middlebury student is required to complete successfully four courses to fulfill the cultures and civilizations requirement. Specifically, every student takes at least one course in each of at least three of the following regions, focusing on some aspect of the cultures and civilizations of that region.</p>\n<p>a. <strong>SOA</strong>: South and Southeast Asia, including the Pacific</p>\n<p>b. <strong>NOA</strong>: North Asia including China, Korea, Japan and the Asian steppes</p>\n<p>c. <strong>MDE</strong>: Middle East and North Africa</p>\n<p>d. <strong>SAF</strong>: Sub-Saharan Africa</p>\n<p>e. <strong>EUR</strong>: Europe</p>\n<p>f. <strong>AMR</strong>: the Americas</p>\n<p>plus one Comparative (<strong>CMP</strong>) course, focused on the process of comparison between and among cultures and civilizations, or on the identity and experience of separable groups within cultures and civilizations.</p>\n<p>A single course may be listed as fulfilling one of the regional categories (SOA, NOA, MDE, SAF, EUR, AMR; as recommended by the course instructor and determined by the Curriculum Committee).  Courses that satisfy CMP may also carry one of the regional area designations, however a student may not count one of these courses toward both the CMP and regional requirements. A student may count the same course toward both an academic category requirement, and one of the cultures and civilization<span>s</span> requirements. Courses that count toward the major and the minor, winter term courses, summer study courses, and first-year student seminars may be used to satisfy the cultures and civilizations requirement.</p>\n<p>College Board Advanced Placement credits may not be used to satisfy distribution or cultures and civilizations requirements.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"major\" id=\"major\"></a>C. Major Programs of Study</strong></p>\n<p>Students choose one of the following programs of study:</p>\n<p>(a) 1 major (departmental, joint, or interdisciplinary**)</p>\n<p>(b) 1 major (departmental, joint, or interdisciplinary**), 1 minor</p>\n<p>(c) 1 departmental major, 2 minors</p>\n<p>(d) 2 majors* (<em>either 2 departmental or one departmental and one interdisciplinary**</em>), no minor.</p>\n<p>*<em>A student who has declared two majors will have to choose to complete only one major should scheduling conflicts occur.</em><br>\n**<em>Majors considered interdisciplinary include: American Studies; Black Studies; Environmental Studies; Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies; International and Global Studies; International Politics and Economics; Molecular Biology and Biochemistry; and Neuroscience.</em></p>\n<p>A major requires a minimum of 10 fall and spring semester courses. Students may take no more than 16 fall and spring semester courses and, in addition, no more than two winter term and summer study courses, combined, in a major department or program (one of which may be senior work).</p>\n<p>All students must officially declare a major by the end of the third semester. Any student who wishes to complete a second major must officially declare by the end of the fourth semester of study. After the fourth semester, students wishing to add a second major, or change majors, must petition and gain approval from the new department or program to ensure that the student can complete the major by the end of the eighth semester.</p>\n<p>Some highly structured programs, particularly those involving study in the foreign languages or the natural sciences, are facilitated by a declaration of major by the end of the second semester.</p>\n<p>A department may define standards for the admission of students to its major program. Students who do not meet these standards may be denied admission or may be admitted provisionally, pending demonstration of their qualifications for advanced work in the department.</p>\n<p>In addition to specific courses required for a major, cognate courses may be recommended to further the student's particular academic interests or intentions. Departments offer different opportunities for senior work, adjusted both to the nature of the field and to students' needs. Students should consult the descriptions of senior work under each department or program for details on the available senior work offerings.</p>\n<p>Major/Adviser Declaration/Change Forms are available in the Office of the Registrar and each of the Commons offices. The declaration Form must be signed by the chair of the major department or program (or designee).</p>\n<p><strong>D. Change of Major</strong></p>\n<p>To change a major, students must petition and gain approval from the new department or program (or designee) to ensure that they can complete the major by the end of the eighth semester. Upon gaining approval of that plan, the student must submit a Change of Major Form to the Office of the Registrar, signed by the adviser and chair (or designee) of the proposed major department or program.</p>\n<p><strong>E. Joint Majors</strong></p>\n<p>To complete a joint major, a student is required to:</p>\n<p>1. Secure formal approval from advisers and chairs (or designees) in both departments or programs. To gain that approval, the student is required to work with the chairs (or designees) of both departments or programs on an academic program for completion of the proposed joint major. The minimum requirements agreed upon, and the overall program must be submitted in writing with the signature of the two department or program chairs (or designees) to the Office of the Registrar.</p>\n<p>2. Complete a senior program which combines both majors and is agreed upon by the advisers and department or program chairs (or designees) involved. That senior work may include or exclude normal expectations regarding independent work and general examinations as appropriate.</p>\n<p>A student declaring a joint major may not declare any other major.</p>\n<p><strong>F. Two Majors</strong></p>\n<p>To complete two separate majors <em>(either 2 departmental or one departmental and one interdisciplinary</em>), a student is required to:</p>\n<p>1. Formally declare both majors according to procedures stated above, with the approval of the chairs (or designees) of both departments or programs.</p>\n<p>2. Complete all the requirements for the major in each department or program. A course will meet the requirements of more than one major for the same student if that specific course is listed by number and name, in the departments' course listings, as specifically required for both majors. Up to two courses implicitly or explicitly listed as generic or categorical requirements of both majors will also meet the requirements of more than one major for the same student. No other courses will be counted as satisfying the requirements of more than one major for the same student except by specific action of the Curriculum Committee and faculty.</p>\n<p>3. A student declaring two majors may not declare any minors.</p>\n<p><strong>G. Minors</strong></p>\n<p>Students may elect to complete only one minor if they are undertaking a major that is joint or interdisciplinary. Students may declare up to two minors if they are undertaking a departmental major. A student declaring two majors may not declare any minors.</p>\n<p>Normally, all students choosing to declare a minor will do so officially by the end of the Add period of the 7<sup>th</sup> semester of study.</p>\n<p>Minors will consist of four to six courses, at least one of which must be at an advanced level.</p>\n<p>Departments and programs may designate configurations of courses that will constitute a minor (or minors) for that department, program, or major.</p>\n<p>Students may not self-design a minor.</p>\n<p>Faculty may design interdepartmental minors in those areas of the curriculum in which a major is not offered, subject to approval by the full faculty.</p>\n<p>Minors will be listed on students' transcripts.</p>\n<p>A course may count toward a student's major or minor, but not toward both. A course counted toward one minor may not be counted toward an additional minor.</p>\n<p><strong>H. Independent Scholar Program</strong></p>\n<p>The Independent Scholar Program is designed to meet the needs of outstanding students who have clearly defined educational goals that cannot be fulfilled within the framework of a normal departmental or interdisciplinary major. Independent Scholars plan their own curricular programs with the assistance of a faculty adviser. Independent Scholars cannot propose two majors, but can pursue an independent scholar major and one minor. For the 2019-20 academic year, application materials are due to the Curriculum Committee by Monday, October 7, 2019, for fall review; and Monday, February 17, 2020, for spring review.</p>\n<p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> For an application to be considered, a student must be in the sophomore year and have a GPA of 3.5 or higher. If approved, students must fulfill all requirements for the degree using their approved Independent Scholar plan as their major course of study.  Independent Scholar proposals will be evaluated in light of feasibility, academic disciplinary integrity, and demonstrated ability of the student. A successful proposal must articulate a fully developed program of study, must include a methods course, and must demonstrate compellingly that the student’s academic goals cannot be met through existing majors.</p>\n<p><strong>Application process:</strong> To be designated an Independent Scholar, a student must undergo a rigorous approval process overseen by the Curriculum Committee. The process begins with an interview with the dean of curriculum. The student must subsequently prepare and submit a well-defined program to the Curriculum Committee, covering a description of the aim of the program, the independent work, and the courses he or she proposes to comprise the major. The proposal must be accompanied by a written endorsement of a faculty member who is willing and qualified to supervise the student, as well as a statement of support from an alternate faculty member. Faculty member endorsements should describe a student’s readiness to partake in the independent scholar program and should include support for and evidence of the student’s capacity for serious, independent intellectual inquiry. The Curriculum Committee will review all submitted materials, and if warranted, convene a meeting with the candidate and advisers. Final approval rests with the Curriculum Committee.  An applicant whose proposal is denied is entitled to meet with the dean of curriculum or the Curriculum Committee.</p>\n<p><strong>Oversight:</strong> The Curriculum Committee will solicit updates from each Independent Scholar twice a year. Changes to the program must also be submitted to the Curriculum Committee, and the faculty supervisor will cosign all registration materials. The Major Declaration Form and Degree Audit Forms will be signed by both the faculty adviser and dean of curriculum. Students who elect to withdraw from the Independent Scholar Program, or who have their independent scholar status withdrawn, may be allowed, at the discretion of the committee, to graduate in general studies, without a formal major in any department.</p>\n<p><strong>Senior work:</strong> The INDE 0800 is a culminating experience for this program of study. This project brings together the course work the student has completed and incorporates all aspects of the study into one final project. Students applying to be independent scholars are asked to provide an indication of possible INDE 0800 projects at the time that they submit their proposals. Students are able, however, to change the topic of their INDE 0800 project in order to respond to new interests and information acquired during the course of their study.</p>\n<p>The INDE 0800 project is undertaken for one or two terms. Students who wish to be considered for honors must work with a thesis committee. Thesis work most typically follows the procedures for the department most closely related to the project. Others may choose to work with an individual faculty member, usually the student's adviser. The choice of senior project is flexible. For example, with permission from the adviser, a student in the performing arts might want to incorporate a dance performance, musical composition, or some other feature as part of his or her course of study.</p>\n<p><strong>Honors:</strong> In order to be considered for honors, independent scholars normally must meet two criteria: a minimum average of B+ in courses taken towards the major and a minimum grade of B+ on the senior work component. The Registrar's Office oversees the first requirement and will inform the adviser of the student's eligibility. The senior work component must be evaluated by a committee of three faculty members (one of whom, at the adviser's request, may be a faculty member on the Curriculum Committee). Minimum thesis grades for each level of honors are B+ (Honors), A- (High Honors), and A (Highest Honors), but the determination of the appropriate level will be made by the thesis committee.</p>\n<p><em>For more information about this program, contact Suzanne Gurland, Dean of Curriculum.</em></p>\n<p><strong>I. 0500 Courses</strong></p>\n<p>The election of a 0500 project provides an opportunity for individual work in one's field of interest. It is a privilege open to those students with advanced preparation and superior records in their fields; exceptions will be considered by submitting a request to the Curriculum Committee. The 0500 projects in a student's major or minor department must be approved by the department. All 0500 projects proposed outside of the major or minor department must be approved by the chair of the department in which the work is to be done. Students who have earned 17 or fewer credits, not including pre-college testing credits, are normally not permitted to undertake independent work during the Fall and Spring semesters. Exceptions may be considered upon written request to the Curriculum Committee. Students with 8 or more credits may pursue independent work during winter term, or summer study, provided the 0500 course is offered then. A student is limited to four 0500 projects in any discipline, not including winter term or summer study independent projects. Independent study courses are graded on an A-F basis unless special arrangements are made through the dean of curriculum (e.g., occasional independent projects where the instructor decides that the special nature of the course is better suited to honors/pass/fail grading).</p>\n<p><strong>J. Senior Program</strong></p>\n<p>Departments may organize independent senior work to suit their students' needs under the general principle of encouraging students in independent work.</p>\n<p>When senior independent work continues through more than one term, a grade of S (satisfactory) or U (unsatisfactory) will be submitted for each term of the project. When a final grade is recorded, the S or U will be converted to whatever final grade is reported.</p>\n<p><strong>In addition to senior independent work, departments may also offer a general examination</strong>. If given, the general examination becomes a fixed degree requirement and may count as one or two course units, as the department shall determine. It may receive a grade separate from that given to the senior independent work.</p>\n<p>Normally, general examinations will be held in a student's senior year. In certain cases, students may take general examinations at the end of their junior year. All reexaminations must be taken at Middlebury under the supervision of those in charge of the major program. Prior registration for such examinations must be made with the Commons dean and department chair.</p>\n<p>Each department may, at its discretion and in accordance with its requirements, excuse students from final examinations in their major field if they achieve a specified grade in the general examination.</p>\n<p>A maximum value of three course units may be assigned for senior work.</p>\n<p><em>rev. 9/9/19</em></p>"},"cc8c48bb-59cb-5763-8822-fbef6cdb263c":{"id":"cc8c48bb-59cb-5763-8822-fbef6cdb263c","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/course-reg-course-conduct","title":"B.1. Academic Policies","body":"\n**1\\. Registration Procedure**\n\nStudents register for fall, winter, and spring courses using the online registration system. Registration information is communicated to students, by e-mail, prior to the registration period, which consists of an advising period, a practice round, and a real-time registration round.\n\n**<a name=\"course\" id=\"course\"></a>2\\. Course Load**\n\nA student's normal program consists of four courses in the fall and spring semesters and one course in the winter term. First-year students must be in residence for winter term and enrolled in an academic course.  Full-time students must take at least three courses per semester.\n\nSophomores and juniors may register for a fifth course during the fall or spring semester only with specific approval of their advisors and the dean of their Commons during the add/drop period using the special orange add card. Normally, this permission is granted to students who have maintained an average of B or better in the two preceding semesters. Seniors may register for five courses during the add period without their dean's or advisor's approval. The comprehensive fee remains unchanged for a three-, four-, and five-course program. Students may not take more than five courses per semester.\n\nAll entering first-year students register for a first-year seminar in their first semester at Middlebury. Students are encouraged to explore a range of subjects and select the remainder of their first-semester program in consultation with their advisors. Final registration for courses occurs after students have attended informational sessions on the various departmental offerings and have taken appropriate placement tests. In their first semester students may not take two courses in the same subject, may not register for more than one first-year seminar, may not receive college-writing (CW) credit for a CW course taken concurrently with the first-year seminar, and may register for only one beginning language in the fall term. In their second semester, first-year students may register for two courses in one subject with their advisor's approval.\n\n<span>Under certain exceptional circumstances, students may be permitted to carry fewer than three courses. When this request is based on a documented disability, students should apply to the Student Accessibility Services office. When this request is based on an exceptional personal circumstances, students may apply to the Administration Committee.  Students who receive approval for a reduced course load pay the full comprehensive fee. Students with reduced course loads should work closely with academic advisors to ensure their compliance with Middlebury’s Satisfactory Academic Progress policy.</span>\n\n**<a name=\"pass\" id=\"pass\"></a>3\\. Pass/D/Fail Grading Option**\n\nStudents may opt to take a course on a Pass/D/Fail basis under the following conditions:\n\na. Students may count toward graduation no more than a total of five courses with non-standard grading.  The category of “non-standard grading” includes courses elected under the Pass/D/Fail option; AP, IB, A-Level, and other pre-college testing credits; winter term and summer study honors/pass/fail courses\\*; and credit-bearing internships.  Of these five credits, only *two* may be taken under the Pass/D/Fail option. Specific guidelines concerning non-standard grading can be found in the College Handbook under [Degree Requirements](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/college-handbook-2017-revision/II.-policies-for-the-undergraduate-college/policies-for-undergrads/academic-policies/degree-requirements).\n\nb. Students must be enrolled in at least three other courses with standard grading to take an additional course Pass/D/Fail.\n\nc. Courses taken under the Pass/D/Fail option may not be used to satisfy distribution, College Writing, First-Year Seminar, or cultures and civilizations requirements.\n\nd. Courses taken under the Pass/D/Fail option may not be used to satisfy major or minor requirements, with one exception: a first course taken under the Pass/D/Fail option in a department or program in which a student subsequently declares a major or minor may, *with the approval of the department chair or program director*, be counted toward major or minor requirements.\n\ne. Students may elect the Pass/D/Fail option, for a course in which they are already registered, during the first four weeks of the semester.  Students must turn in a completed Pass/D/Fail application by the end of the fourth week of classes.  The deadline for changing a course from Pass/D/Fail to standard grading is the drop deadline (i.e., the end of the fifth week of the semester). Students must email the Registrar's Office with their intent to revoke Pass/D/Fail by the end of the fifth week of classes.\n\nf. Winter Term: Students may not elect the Pass/D/Fail option for winter term courses which are otherwise offered with standard grading.  Occasionally the Curriculum Committee gives an instructor permission to offer an entire course as pass/fail or honors/pass/fail; if a student takes one of these courses, it will not count as one of his or her two Pass/D/Fail courses, but it will count toward the total of five courses with non-standard grading a student may count toward graduation\\*.\n\ng. Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey (MIIS) and Study Abroad: Students may not elect the Pass/D/Fail option for courses taken abroad or at MIIS. However, courses taken at MIIS or within an approved study abroad program that are offered in their entirety as pass/fail—including study abroad internships—will not count as one of the two Pass/D/Fail courses, but will count toward the total of five courses with non-standard grading a student may count toward graduation.\n\nh. A grade of Pass will not be calculated in the student’s GPA. The grades of D and F will be calculated in the GPA.\n\n\\*NOTE: Winter term or summer study pass/fail courses are not counted in the maximum 5 non-standard grade course total for students who matriculated in the fall 2016 semester or later.\n\n**<a name=\"auditing\" id=\"auditing\"></a>4\\. Auditing**\n\nWith advance permission of the instructor, a regularly enrolled student may audit other classes. The instructor establishes the conditions under which the student may audit. A student may request official audit status, in which case the course will be recorded on his or her transcript with \"AUD\" in the grade column. In order to obtain official audit status, the student must make a request to the instructor, and they must agree in writing on the conditions of satisfactory completion. Students must register for audited courses during the normal add period. After the end of the add/drop period, no student may change his/her audit status without approval from the Administration Committee. In no case may the student receive credit for auditing.\n\nCommunity members living in the Middlebury area may audit courses only with the permission of the instructor and the dean of curriculum or designee. Community members interested in auditing a course at the College, must complete the [Community Member Audit Request](https://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/290549/original/audit_form.doc) form and obtain the requisite signatures indicating approval. The audit status, if approved, is not officially recorded and there is no academic transcript kept in these cases. Current high school students may not audit courses at Middlebury College.\n\n**<a name=\"change\" id=\"change\"></a>5\\. Change of Course Registration**\n\nImmediately following the online registration period and through the end of the second week of the fall and spring semesters, course additions may be made if students have the consent of the instructor of the course into which the student wishes to enroll. Students must turn in their add cards by the end of the second week of classes.\n\nStudents may not add a course after the deadline. Petitions for exceptions to this rule will be considered by the Office of the Registrar, and, if approved, a charge of $50 per add will be assessed.  The Office of the Registrar may forward to the Administration Committee any petitions for which the registrar requests faculty review and a committee decision. A student may withdraw from a course without receiving a failing grade up to the end of the fifth week of the semester.\n\nAfter the fifth week of classes, a student may petition the Administration Committee in writing to withdraw from a course for exceptional personal reasons, which may include but are not limited to significant injuries and non-chronic illnesses. The petition should be endorsed by the student's Commons dean. Students may petition the Student Accessibility Services staff to withdraw from a course for reasons based on a documented disability. If permission is granted, the course will be removed from the student's transcript; if it is denied, the student will remain on the roster for that course. Withdrawals for other reasons are not permitted after the end of the fifth week. A student may also petition the Administration Committee to correct the student's enrollment if the student provides written confirmation from the instructor that the student did not attend the class. If permission is granted, a charge of $50 per dropped course will be assessed. A student who fails to complete the work of a course will receive a failing grade in that course.\n\nDuring winter term, course changes are made by the same procedures, but the add/drop period ends at the end of the third day of classes during the winter term. Requests to add a winter term course after this deadline are automatically charged the late fee of $50.\n\nStudents who add a class late do so at their own risk. They will not be permitted to use a late start as the reason for dropping a course after the deadline.\n\n**<a name=\"size\" id=\"size\"></a>6\\. Size of Classes**\n\nFall or spring semester course enrollment may not be limited or cut off during registration without permission of the VPAA/DOF or designee. This restriction does not apply to first-year student seminars, College Writing courses, seminars, language and laboratory sections, and studio courses. Department chairs are responsible for ensuring that there are an adequate number of openings for incoming first-year students in September and February.\n\nA list of all courses in which six or fewer students are enrolled will be referred to the VPAA/DOF or designee after completion of a registration period. The advisability of offering such courses for the current semester will be discussed promptly with the department chair involved. Enrollment in winter term courses is limited. _(See \"[Winter Term](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/winter-term)\")._\n\n**<a name=\"class\" id=\"class\"></a>7\\. Class Meeting and Scheduling**\n\nInstructors are expected to conduct classes at the time and place scheduled. Regularly scheduled classes are not held between the hours of 4:15 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. Evening classes are permitted on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Evening classes on other nights must be approved by the VPAA/DOF or designee. No intercollegiate athletic contests will be scheduled for Monday evenings.\n\nIndividual faculty requests for changes in the published schedule must be approved by the department chair and dean of curriculum before such changes take place. Other requests for use of classrooms must be approved by the course scheduler.\n\nMost courses meet for three hours per week with the exception of laboratory, drill, and discussion meetings. Department chairs are responsible for ensuring that scheduling information is included on the department course information forms.\n\n**8\\. Attendance**\n\nIndividual instructors set attendance policies. They should announce these policies during the first week of classes. A student's grade in a course may be reduced for nonattendance.\n\nThe Commons deans are charged with the responsibility of granting substantiated excuses for absences from class if warranted by compelling personal circumstances, observance of religious holidays, illnesses, or injuries. Please note that dean's excuses for class absences are granted only under exceptional circumstances, or where there are repeated or prolonged absences involved. Most concerns about class absences should be worked out between the individual student and the faculty member, in the context of the faculty member's own policies on class attendance. The Commons dean may provide an \"Explanation of Absence\" for athletic absences.\n\nA student who is absent from a pre-announced examination without excuse receives a failure for the examination and is not granted the privilege of making it up.\n\nA student who fails to attend the first two hours of class loses his or her space in the class, unless excused in advance.\n\n_**Guidelines for Handling Athletics-Explained Absences**_\n\nThe list of scheduled athletics contests you receive several times a year from the director of Athletics has been approved by the [Athletic Policy Committee](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/winter-term) of the faculty (APC) acting under guidelines set forth in the *Middlebury College Handbook.* This list tells you when legitimate absences from class may be expected by students because they are involved in a sanctioned athletic event scheduled for that date. The APC regards these lists as informative. They are an *explanation* for an absence, but they do not imply that the student is excused from the obligations of a course or the class work missed.\n\nAlthough faculty members are expected to make their policy on course attendance clear at the beginning of each course, it is the individual student's responsibility to consult with his or her instructor as to the effect of explained absences.\n\n_**To the Professor:**_\n\nPlease read the guidelines for students and coaches in the following sections regarding \"Explained Absences.\" Note that it is the student's responsibility to approach you in the first week of the course to identify possible conflicts between their athletics schedule and your course. However, it would be helpful if you, during the first week of classes, remind students of their obligation.\n\nHow you handle missed work is entirely up to you. However, it is the College's policy that athletics are an important part of a student's life at Middlebury. There are a number of possible solutions to missed work. For example, if a lab or discussion is missed, the student may be able to attend a different section meeting. If a paper is due, ask that the paper to be handed in prior to the student's leaving. If a lecture is to be missed, you may permit the student to record the lecture (with assistance from another student). We do recognize, however, that there are cases for which there is no satisfactory make-up possible. Please do your best to accommodate the student without sacrificing academic rigor.\n\nAfter a student has approached you, please:\n\n**1.** Identify work that will be missed.\n\n**2.** Do your best to find a solution to missed material.\n\n**3.** Communicate your decision clearly to the student. When a student has approached you at the beginning of a semester regarding conflicts, it is your responsibility to communicate your decision on missed work before the end of the drop/add period.\n\nPlease note that if a student is involved in a winter or spring season sport, they may not be aware of scheduling conflicts until the semester or term is underway. Again, it is the student's responsibility to approach you as soon as his or her schedule is set to make arrangements regarding missed work, and it is your responsibility to communicate in a timely manner your decision on how to handle the missed work.\n\nAdditionally, at the beginning of the semester, you are encouraged to make students aware of any important class activities that will fall outside the normal class schedule of Monday-Friday 8 a.m.-4:15 p.m. and Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday 7:30-10:25 p.m.\n\n_**Note**_ that missing a regularly scheduled class for a practice in no way constitutes an explained absence and is not expected or mandated by coaching faculty.\n\n_**To the Student:**_\n\nYou should be given a list of dates and times of scheduled games by your coach no later than the first day of classes in any term or semester in which you are involved in a varsity/junior varsity sport, or in the case of winter or spring season sports, by whichever comes first, the first preseason meeting or the first day of practice (November 1 for winter, February 15 for spring). Compare each class schedule with your schedule of games. For any course in which you see a potential conflict between academic and athletic schedules, it is your responsibility to contact the professor during the first week of class, or as soon as the scheduling conflicts are known (for example, in the case of winter season sports that begin late in the fall term) and:\n\n**1.** Identify times of conflict.\n\n**2.** Together arrive at an understanding of how missed work/class might be made up.\n\n_**Please note:**_\n\n**1.** Professors will do their best to accommodate your needs within reason.\n\n**2.** The professor will make the final decision as to how the missed work is to be made up. In cases where you approach the professor at the beginning of term, it is the professor's responsibility to arrive at this decision in time for you to drop/add if her/his decision is unsatisfactory to you. There are some cases for which there may be no satisfactory makeup possible.\n\n**3.** Conflicts with official practices are also possible in the case of special class events, such as a guest lecturer. In such cases, you should discuss the situation with both your professor and your coach, and make a decision with full understanding of the ramifications of your decision.\n\n**4.** Conflicts should be resolved through discussions between yourself, your professor, and your coach. If there are difficulties, you may consult with your Commons dean.\n\n_**Note**_ that missing a regularly scheduled class for a practice in no way constitutes an explained absence and is not expected or mandated by coaching faculty.\n\n_**To the Coach:**_\n\nPlease read the statements for the students and the professors on the preceding sections and note your role in this process. We ask you to:\n\n**1.** On or before the first day of each semester, or at the start of the season, give each student on the team you coach the list of contests that conflict with the normal 8 a.m.-4:15 p.m. Monday-Friday and Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday 7:30-10:25 p.m. class hours.\n\n**2.** Remind students that it is their responsibility to contact each of their professors and identify potential time/work conflicts.\n\n**3.** Explain to the students that there may be times when a practice needs to be missed for special class events (such as a guest lecturer). In such cases, the student should inform you of the potential conflict and discuss it with both you and the professor. It is important that students be able to make such decisions concerning conflicts with full information as to the ramifications of their decisions.\n\n**4.** There will be times when it is in the best interest of the student to attend class rather than a game, and we encourage you to support the student in such a case.\n\nWe believe that your role as a coach is very important. Students often look more to their coaches than to their professors for guidance on these issues. It is important that you understand the College policy and do your best to help resolve conflicts between these two very important, but sometimes competing, aspects of students' lives at Middlebury.\n\n_**To the Captains:**_\n\nAs a team leader, you should encourage your team members to meet with professors to discuss possible scheduling conflicts. Please ensure that your team members are aware of these guidelines on explained absences and understand that the process is one of negotiation among the coach, student, and professor.\n\n**9\\. Class Lectures and Presentations**\n\nClassroom lectures or presentations at the College are the intellectual property of the individual professor, Middlebury College, and/or both. The copying, publication, or distribution of any transcripts, audio, or video of such lectures or presentations without prior written approval of the individual professor is prohibited.\n\n**10\\. Religious Holidays**\n\nMiddlebury College recognizes that the student body includes adherents of many faiths and that observance of religious holidays is an important part of religious practice for many students. The following policies have been established in order that students at Middlebury will not suffer academic penalties because of the conscientious observance of religious holidays:\n\nIt is reasonable to consider major religious holidays for the Middlebury student body as a whole to include the following: Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and the first day of Passover; Good Friday and Easter Sunday; Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Examinations should not be scheduled and papers should not be due on any of these holidays. Absences from class on these days because of observance of the religious holiday will be treated as excused absences. In addition, no student will be required to participate in or attend College events such as athletic contests, concerts, or outside lectures on these holidays.\n\nThe Office of the Dean of the College will include the dates of these major religious holidays on the academic calendars that are distributed to the faculty and published on the [College's website](https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/calendar/2017-2018). These calendars will indicate those instances in which the religious holiday begins on the previous evening.\n\nStudents whose conscientious religious observance requires their absence on days other than or in addition to those named above may make use of the following procedure prior to the holiday: The student should submit written notification of the pending religious holiday to his or her Commons dean at least one week before the holiday. The Commons dean will then inform the instructors of the student's courses that the absence on the religious holiday will be regarded as an excused one. Under these circumstances, a student missing an examination will be permitted to take a makeup exam without penalty, and a student with a paper due on a religious holiday will be permitted to submit that paper on the day immediately following the holiday, again without penalty.\n","excerpt":"1. Registration Procedure Students register for fall, winter, and spring courses using the online registration system. Registration…","html":"<p><strong>1. Registration Procedure</strong></p>\n<p>Students register for fall, winter, and spring courses using the online registration system. Registration information is communicated to students, by e-mail, prior to the registration period, which consists of an advising period, a practice round, and a real-time registration round.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"course\" id=\"course\"></a>2. Course Load</strong></p>\n<p>A student's normal program consists of four courses in the fall and spring semesters and one course in the winter term. First-year students must be in residence for winter term and enrolled in an academic course.  Full-time students must take at least three courses per semester.</p>\n<p>Sophomores and juniors may register for a fifth course during the fall or spring semester only with specific approval of their advisors and the dean of their Commons during the add/drop period using the special orange add card. Normally, this permission is granted to students who have maintained an average of B or better in the two preceding semesters. Seniors may register for five courses during the add period without their dean's or advisor's approval. The comprehensive fee remains unchanged for a three-, four-, and five-course program. Students may not take more than five courses per semester.</p>\n<p>All entering first-year students register for a first-year seminar in their first semester at Middlebury. Students are encouraged to explore a range of subjects and select the remainder of their first-semester program in consultation with their advisors. Final registration for courses occurs after students have attended informational sessions on the various departmental offerings and have taken appropriate placement tests. In their first semester students may not take two courses in the same subject, may not register for more than one first-year seminar, may not receive college-writing (CW) credit for a CW course taken concurrently with the first-year seminar, and may register for only one beginning language in the fall term. In their second semester, first-year students may register for two courses in one subject with their advisor's approval.</p>\n<p><span>Under certain exceptional circumstances, students may be permitted to carry fewer than three courses. When this request is based on a documented disability, students should apply to the Student Accessibility Services office. When this request is based on an exceptional personal circumstances, students may apply to the Administration Committee.  Students who receive approval for a reduced course load pay the full comprehensive fee. Students with reduced course loads should work closely with academic advisors to ensure their compliance with Middlebury’s Satisfactory Academic Progress policy.</span></p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"pass\" id=\"pass\"></a>3. Pass/D/Fail Grading Option</strong></p>\n<p>Students may opt to take a course on a Pass/D/Fail basis under the following conditions:</p>\n<p>a. Students may count toward graduation no more than a total of five courses with non-standard grading.  The category of “non-standard grading” includes courses elected under the Pass/D/Fail option; AP, IB, A-Level, and other pre-college testing credits; winter term and summer study honors/pass/fail courses*; and credit-bearing internships.  Of these five credits, only <em>two</em> may be taken under the Pass/D/Fail option. Specific guidelines concerning non-standard grading can be found in the College Handbook under <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/about/college-handbook-2017-revision/II.-policies-for-the-undergraduate-college/policies-for-undergrads/academic-policies/degree-requirements\">Degree Requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>b. Students must be enrolled in at least three other courses with standard grading to take an additional course Pass/D/Fail.</p>\n<p>c. Courses taken under the Pass/D/Fail option may not be used to satisfy distribution, College Writing, First-Year Seminar, or cultures and civilizations requirements.</p>\n<p>d. Courses taken under the Pass/D/Fail option may not be used to satisfy major or minor requirements, with one exception: a first course taken under the Pass/D/Fail option in a department or program in which a student subsequently declares a major or minor may, <em>with the approval of the department chair or program director</em>, be counted toward major or minor requirements.</p>\n<p>e. Students may elect the Pass/D/Fail option, for a course in which they are already registered, during the first four weeks of the semester.  Students must turn in a completed Pass/D/Fail application by the end of the fourth week of classes.  The deadline for changing a course from Pass/D/Fail to standard grading is the drop deadline (i.e., the end of the fifth week of the semester). Students must email the Registrar's Office with their intent to revoke Pass/D/Fail by the end of the fifth week of classes.</p>\n<p>f. Winter Term: Students may not elect the Pass/D/Fail option for winter term courses which are otherwise offered with standard grading.  Occasionally the Curriculum Committee gives an instructor permission to offer an entire course as pass/fail or honors/pass/fail; if a student takes one of these courses, it will not count as one of his or her two Pass/D/Fail courses, but it will count toward the total of five courses with non-standard grading a student may count toward graduation*.</p>\n<p>g. Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey (MIIS) and Study Abroad: Students may not elect the Pass/D/Fail option for courses taken abroad or at MIIS. However, courses taken at MIIS or within an approved study abroad program that are offered in their entirety as pass/fail—including study abroad internships—will not count as one of the two Pass/D/Fail courses, but will count toward the total of five courses with non-standard grading a student may count toward graduation.</p>\n<p>h. A grade of Pass will not be calculated in the student’s GPA. The grades of D and F will be calculated in the GPA.</p>\n<p>*NOTE: Winter term or summer study pass/fail courses are not counted in the maximum 5 non-standard grade course total for students who matriculated in the fall 2016 semester or later.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"auditing\" id=\"auditing\"></a>4. Auditing</strong></p>\n<p>With advance permission of the instructor, a regularly enrolled student may audit other classes. The instructor establishes the conditions under which the student may audit. A student may request official audit status, in which case the course will be recorded on his or her transcript with \"AUD\" in the grade column. In order to obtain official audit status, the student must make a request to the instructor, and they must agree in writing on the conditions of satisfactory completion. Students must register for audited courses during the normal add period. After the end of the add/drop period, no student may change his/her audit status without approval from the Administration Committee. In no case may the student receive credit for auditing.</p>\n<p>Community members living in the Middlebury area may audit courses only with the permission of the instructor and the dean of curriculum or designee. Community members interested in auditing a course at the College, must complete the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/290549/original/audit_form.doc\">Community Member Audit Request</a> form and obtain the requisite signatures indicating approval. The audit status, if approved, is not officially recorded and there is no academic transcript kept in these cases. Current high school students may not audit courses at Middlebury College.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"change\" id=\"change\"></a>5. Change of Course Registration</strong></p>\n<p>Immediately following the online registration period and through the end of the second week of the fall and spring semesters, course additions may be made if students have the consent of the instructor of the course into which the student wishes to enroll. Students must turn in their add cards by the end of the second week of classes.</p>\n<p>Students may not add a course after the deadline. Petitions for exceptions to this rule will be considered by the Office of the Registrar, and, if approved, a charge of $50 per add will be assessed.  The Office of the Registrar may forward to the Administration Committee any petitions for which the registrar requests faculty review and a committee decision. A student may withdraw from a course without receiving a failing grade up to the end of the fifth week of the semester.</p>\n<p>After the fifth week of classes, a student may petition the Administration Committee in writing to withdraw from a course for exceptional personal reasons, which may include but are not limited to significant injuries and non-chronic illnesses. The petition should be endorsed by the student's Commons dean. Students may petition the Student Accessibility Services staff to withdraw from a course for reasons based on a documented disability. If permission is granted, the course will be removed from the student's transcript; if it is denied, the student will remain on the roster for that course. Withdrawals for other reasons are not permitted after the end of the fifth week. A student may also petition the Administration Committee to correct the student's enrollment if the student provides written confirmation from the instructor that the student did not attend the class. If permission is granted, a charge of $50 per dropped course will be assessed. A student who fails to complete the work of a course will receive a failing grade in that course.</p>\n<p>During winter term, course changes are made by the same procedures, but the add/drop period ends at the end of the third day of classes during the winter term. Requests to add a winter term course after this deadline are automatically charged the late fee of $50.</p>\n<p>Students who add a class late do so at their own risk. They will not be permitted to use a late start as the reason for dropping a course after the deadline.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"size\" id=\"size\"></a>6. Size of Classes</strong></p>\n<p>Fall or spring semester course enrollment may not be limited or cut off during registration without permission of the VPAA/DOF or designee. This restriction does not apply to first-year student seminars, College Writing courses, seminars, language and laboratory sections, and studio courses. Department chairs are responsible for ensuring that there are an adequate number of openings for incoming first-year students in September and February.</p>\n<p>A list of all courses in which six or fewer students are enrolled will be referred to the VPAA/DOF or designee after completion of a registration period. The advisability of offering such courses for the current semester will be discussed promptly with the department chair involved. Enrollment in winter term courses is limited. <em>(See \"<a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/winter-term\">Winter Term</a>\").</em></p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"class\" id=\"class\"></a>7. Class Meeting and Scheduling</strong></p>\n<p>Instructors are expected to conduct classes at the time and place scheduled. Regularly scheduled classes are not held between the hours of 4:15 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. Evening classes are permitted on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Evening classes on other nights must be approved by the VPAA/DOF or designee. No intercollegiate athletic contests will be scheduled for Monday evenings.</p>\n<p>Individual faculty requests for changes in the published schedule must be approved by the department chair and dean of curriculum before such changes take place. Other requests for use of classrooms must be approved by the course scheduler.</p>\n<p>Most courses meet for three hours per week with the exception of laboratory, drill, and discussion meetings. Department chairs are responsible for ensuring that scheduling information is included on the department course information forms.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Attendance</strong></p>\n<p>Individual instructors set attendance policies. They should announce these policies during the first week of classes. A student's grade in a course may be reduced for nonattendance.</p>\n<p>The Commons deans are charged with the responsibility of granting substantiated excuses for absences from class if warranted by compelling personal circumstances, observance of religious holidays, illnesses, or injuries. Please note that dean's excuses for class absences are granted only under exceptional circumstances, or where there are repeated or prolonged absences involved. Most concerns about class absences should be worked out between the individual student and the faculty member, in the context of the faculty member's own policies on class attendance. The Commons dean may provide an \"Explanation of Absence\" for athletic absences.</p>\n<p>A student who is absent from a pre-announced examination without excuse receives a failure for the examination and is not granted the privilege of making it up.</p>\n<p>A student who fails to attend the first two hours of class loses his or her space in the class, unless excused in advance.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Guidelines for Handling Athletics-Explained Absences</strong></em></p>\n<p>The list of scheduled athletics contests you receive several times a year from the director of Athletics has been approved by the <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/winter-term\">Athletic Policy Committee</a> of the faculty (APC) acting under guidelines set forth in the <em>Middlebury College Handbook.</em> This list tells you when legitimate absences from class may be expected by students because they are involved in a sanctioned athletic event scheduled for that date.

One Middlebury College course credit will be awarded for each qualifying AP exam score up to the maximum allowed as specified above in section A. Degree Requirements. Two credits will be awarded in those instances in which the department has demonstrated to the Curriculum Committee that the AP examination adequately covers material in two separately numbered Middlebury College courses that students would normally take sequentially.\n\nb. Advanced Placement credits may be used to anticipate course work at Middlebury. AP credits applied toward graduation will be counted toward the 16-course limit in the department granting the credit unless the department specifically states that the credits do not count toward the major.  The maximum number of Middlebury College course credits that may be accumulated through AP exams is specified above in section *A. Degree Requirements*.  A student may not register for a Middlebury College course that covers substantially the same material as an AP exam on which he or she has received a score eligible for credit as described above.  Departments will be responsible for submitting to the registrar lists of these equivalent courses.  In exceptional circumstances, the prohibition on registering for a course that is the equivalent of an AP exam may be waived by a department chair.\n\nc. Advanced Placement scores must be reported directly to Middlebury College by the College Board. In order for Advanced Placement credits to count toward the 36 credit requirement for graduation, the examination **scores must be received no later than the end of the student's second semester at Middlebury College.**\n\nStudents may receive a limited number of credits from the major European examination certificates, such as the French Baccalauréat, International Baccalaureate, Swiss Maturité, Artium Examination, British A levels, and German Abitur, if they receive scores that indicate excellent performance.

Students who receive such credit may not then receive credit for Middlebury introductory courses in subjects covered on the examination. Questions regarding credit for examination certificates may be directed to the Registrar's Office.\n\n**3\\. Acceleration**\n\nWith approval from the major department chair or program director, a student with at least 27 earned credits may propose an accelerated program to the Office of the Registrar.\n\nIn order to accelerate graduation, students may apply extra credits from courses taken at Middlebury, credits transferred from courses taken elsewhere, and/or pre-college testing credits, provided all degree requirements are met as stated above in section *A. Degree Requirements*. Once a student is advanced in class standing, it is not normally possible to return to the previous class standing.\n\nThe Office of the Registrar may forward to the Administration Committee petitions for which the registrar requests faculty review and a committee decision.\n\n**<a name=\"the\" id=\"the\"></a>4\\. The Physical Education Requirement**\n\nAs part of Middlebury's degree requirement, each student must complete two physical education courses prior to graduation. Each season of varsity athletic participation counts as one unit of physical education. PHED courses do not count in the total of 36 academic course credits required for graduation.\n\nStudents are encouraged to complete the physical education credits by the end of their fourth semester at Middlebury. In the case of transfer students, students are encouraged to complete the requirement by the end of their second semester at Middlebury.

Grading System**\n\nThe following grades are used at Middlebury College:\n\n**a.** A, B, C, D, F (+ is used only with B and C; - is used only with A, B and C): fall, winter, spring, and summer.\n\nNumerical equivalents of grades:   \nA = 4.00  \nA- = 3.67   \nB+ = 3.33   \nB = 3.00   \nB- = 2.67   \nC+ = 2.33   \nC = 2.00   \nC- = 1.67   \nD = 1.00   \nF = 0\n\n**b.** Credit, no credit: winter term internships, and student-led courses\n\n**c.** S (satisfactory), U (unsatisfactory): for work in progress in a multiple-term course\n\n**d.** INC (incomplete)\n\n**e.** Honors, pass, fail: winter term independent projects and some designated winter term or summer study courses\n\n**f.** P (pass), does not count in the grade point average\n\nNote: The Middlebury grade point average (GPA) is truncated at two decimal points; any values beyond the second decimal place are not considered in the GPA calculation.\n\n**2\\. Probation and Failure**\n\nAll undergraduate students have the same probation and failure rules. These rules also apply to Middlebury undergraduates who enroll in Language Schools, Schools Abroad, Bread Loaf School of English, School of the Environment, and externally sponsored programs approved by the office of International Programs and Off-Campus Study. The Administration Committee will exercise considerable leniency in responding to first-year, first-term students and therefore will give strong consideration to readmitting a student who has received academic failure unless the student has demonstrated flagrant neglect of school work.\n\n_**Probation** (please also refer to the section on [Student Status](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/student-status))**:**_\n\n2 Ds  \n1 D and 1 F  \nD or F in winter term  \nD or F in summer study  \n1 D or 1 F for students completing only three courses in term\n\n_**Failure** (please also refer to the section on [Student Status](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/student-status))**:**_\n\n3 Ds  \n2 Fs  \n1 F and 2 Ds  \n2 Ds or 1 F while on probation  \nD or F in winter term while on probation  \nD or F in summer study while on probation  \nThree times on probation or failure  \n1 F and 1 D, or 2 Ds for students completing only three courses  \nA second successive term on probation\n\n**_Failure while on Probation:_**  \n2 Ds  \n1 F  \nD or F in winter term  \nD or F in summer study  \nThree times on probation  \nA second successive term on probation\n\n**3\\. Grade Reports**\n\nFinal grades are reported to the Registrar's Office at the end of each semester, term or study period. All grades must be submitted online by the time specified by the registrar. A faculty member who fails to meet this deadline is reported within 24 hours to the department chair. If there is no response within another 24 hours, the VPAA/DOF or designate is notified. Instructors should not report final course grades to students.\n\nFailure and D reports must be submitted by instructors to the registrar. These reports are used by the Administration Committee for determining eligibility for readmission and by Commons deans for advising.\n\nStudents are responsible for keeping parents correctly and currently informed of their standing and progress in college. Students can view their own grades online and may print and distribute them as they wish. For students who sign an authorization form each semester, fall grades and spring grades are mailed to parents. Notices of second course warnings, academic probation, academic failure, withdrawals, written reprimands, disciplinary probation, suspension, and expulsion are sent to parents as a matter of course.\n\n**4\\. Repeated Courses**\n\nA student who fails a course and takes it a second time will have both grades calculated into the grade point average. If a student passes a course and then repeats it (after receiving permission of the Administration Committee), only the first grade is calculated into the grade point average, and the course is only counted once for credit, although both grades appear on the transcript\n\n**5\\. Multiple-Semester or Term Course Grades**\n\nWhen a course would have relatively little value unless followed by a second semester or term course intended to complement it, a department may designate first-semester courses for which no credit will be received without completion of a second semester of the course sequence. A department may designate second semester courses in which the final examination will cover the work of the entire year. Students must register each semester or term for the continuing credit. The first semester of such courses is graded Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory. Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory grades may be submitted only for multiple-semester or term projects carrying more than one course credit (500-honors projects for seniors, 700-level senior work). At the conclusion of the project, the student receives alphabetical grades for all course units.\n\n**6\\. Incomplete Grades**\n\nIncompletes are issued only in unanticipated, exceptional circumstances that arise near the end of the term and when a student has been meeting the majority of course expectations. Incompletes are granted by the Commons dean, after consultation with the faculty member involved. In order for the dean to grant an incomplete, the faculty member will provide the dean and the Registrar's Office with a provisional grade that would be assigned if the remaining work in the course were not completed. When the faculty member submits grades for the course, s/he will submit an incomplete for the student.\n\nThe dean will share the provisional grade with the student and will set the deadline for the submission of all remaining work, which will ordinarily be before the deadline for adding classes in the following Fall or Spring semester. The deadline may be no later than the deadline to drop classes in the following semester. Incompletes in winter term courses will follow the same procedures: the deadline for the submission of all remaining work may be no later than the deadline to drop classes in the Spring semester. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all work is completed by the deadline.  Should the faculty member be unavailable to evaluate the remaining work, it will be the responsibility of the department chair or program director, or designee, to complete the evaluation of submitted work. If the course is not completed by the deadline, the provisional grade based on the work that has been completed will be recorded by the Registrar's Office.\n\nIf the Registrar's Office has not received either a provisional or a final grade by the deadline, the grade will ordinarily be recorded as an F. The Registrar's Office will notify the student that the grade has been recorded. Students seeking incompletes based on a disability or medical condition should be directed to the Student Accessibility Services (SAS) Office. When the SAS staff determines that an incomplete is a reasonable accommodation for a disability, the dean will be notified and will grant the incomplete, which should ordinarily follow the procedures described above, unless the SAS Office determines a modification is necessary.\n\n**7\\. Change in Grades**\n\nAny request for a grade change must be submitted on a change of grade form to the Administration Committee by the instructor of the course with the endorsement of the department chair. Changes will be made only in case of clerical error or for the reason of fairness to a student. No change in a final grade on the transcript is effective until it is approved by the entire faculty.\n\nStudents wishing to protest a grade may do so by speaking first to the instructor of the course, and then to the department chair. If the student is still not satisfied, the student may appeal in writing to the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty (VPAA/DOF). The VPAA/DOF or designate will consult with the instructor of the course and the department chair and will make a final decision on the matter.  If the VPAA/DOF recommends a change in the student's grade, that recommendation will be submitted to the Administration Committee, which will include it on the recommendations for grade changes submitted to the faculty. No change in a final grade on the transcript is effective until it is approved by the entire faculty.\n\n**<a name=\"chonors\" id=\"chonors\"></a>8\\. College Honors**\n\n**a.** **_College Scholar:_** semester grade point average of 3.60 or higher for students taking four or more courses, with no grade below B-.\n\n**b.** **_Dean's List:_** semester grade point average of 3.30 or higher for students taking four or more courses, with no grade below B-.\n\n**c.** **_Graduation honors_** (on the basis of cumulative grades from the Middlebury undergraduate, summer, and overseas schools, all other approved programs abroad, and approved programs of domestic off-campus study):\n\n**i.** *Cum laude:* graduation average of 3.40 or higher\n\n**ii.** *Magna cum laude:* graduation average of 3.60 or higher\n\n**iii.** *Summa cum laude:* graduation average of 3.80 or higher\n\nStandards for graduation honors are the same for all students eligible for a degree, regardless of the number of courses taken at Middlebury.\n\nExcept for valedictory and salutatory honors, no class rank is computed for official College purposes. Transfer students are not eligible for valedictory or salutatory honors.\n\nStudents who have received official College discipline as a result of academic dishonesty are ineligible for graduation honors.\n\n**<a name=\"dhonors\" id=\"dhonors\"></a>9\\. Departmental Honors**\n\nAwarding of departmental honors (Honors, High Honors, Highest Honors) is a departmental decision, but the following minimum requirements must be met:\n\n**a.** A student must have at least a B average (3.00) in courses taken in his or her department or program (excluding 0500, 0600, 0700, or equivalent independent study course work, if given).\n\n**b.** There must be significant independent research (0500 project) or an honors thesis (0700 course) in a student's program and the grade must be a B or higher.\n\n**c.** A program must fall within the maximum permissible number of courses that students may take in their major departments. The program may be part of the senior work program or independent of it.\n\n**d.** An exceptionally strong project qualifies the student for honors.\n\n**e.** In order to be considered for honors, independent scholars normally must meet two criteria: a minimum average of B+ in courses taken towards the major and a minimum grade of B+ on the senior work component. The Dean of Curriculum oversees the first requirement and will inform the advisor of the student's eligibility. The senior work component must be evaluated by a committee of three faculty members (one of whom, at the advisor's request, may be a faculty member on the Curriculum Committee). Minimum thesis grades for each level of honors are B+ (Honors), A- (High Honors), and A (Highest Honors), but the determination of the appropriate level will be made by the committee.\n\n**f.** Students who have received official College discipline as a result of academic dishonesty are ineligible for departmental honors.\n\n**10\\. Transcripts**\n\nCurrently enrolled students have secure, ongoing access to their academic records online in BannerWeb. They may also request an official academic transcript from the Registrar's Office. The official transcript contains information on courses taken, grades received, majors and minors, degrees earned and honors awarded. The transcript also includes a student's semester and cumulative grade point average, calculated using the numerical equivalents in Section A above. The grades used in calculating the grade point average are those earned in the Middlebury undergraduate, summer, and overseas schools, all other approved programs abroad, and approved programs of domestic off-campus study.\n\nThe transcript and information in the student file may be released to persons or organizations outside of the College only with specific written authorization from the student or as permitted by the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), as noted in the [Student Privacy Rights under U.S. Federal Law](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/college-handbook-2017-revision/midd-all-policies/record_policies/ferpa) (FERPA) section of the Handbook.\n\nA fee of $5 is charged for each official transcript requested. A request form is available at [https://go.middlebury.edu/transcript](https://go.middlebury.edu/transcript). Transcript requests are accepted by mail, and in person Monday through Friday in Forest Hall during regular office hours.  Students may also request a transcript through the online ordering system. An additional surcharge is applied to transcript orders placed via the online ordering system. Please plan on two days for processing requests, and longer during end of term grading periods.  Students and alumni continue to have access to their own academic records on BannerWeb. No transcript will be issued to students who are financially indebted to the College until satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Office of Student Financial Services.\n\n**11.  Registrar**\n\n**Registrar's Office**   \nE-mail: [registrar@middlebury.edu](mailto:registrar@middlebury.edu)   \nWebsite: [https://go.middlebury.edu/registrar](https://go.middlebury.edu/registrar)  \nPhone: 802.443.5770  \nFax: 802.443.2030\n\nCurrently enrolled students should contact this office if they have questions about their academic transcripts or procedures regarding registration, dropping or adding courses, or transfer of credit.\n\n_rev. 6/19/18_\n","excerpt":"1.

Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy","body":"\n<span>This Policy applies to all undergraduate College students and is intended to ensure compliance with federal regulations.</span>\n\nThe normal timeframe for earning the baccalaureate degree at Middlebury College is four consecutive years of study in a pattern of two 4-credit semesters and 1 Winter Term every year.  When students declare a major, they are required to complete a review of their degree requirements to ensure that they are on track to complete the degree requirements while making satisfactory academic progress.\n\nThe Office of the Registrar reviews all student records at the end of each semester (once grades are submitted and recorded), and notifies the Office of Student Financial Services and the Office of the Dean of Students of any students who are not making satisfactory academic progress.  The Office of Student Financial Services notifies any financial aid recipients who are not making satisfactory academic progress, while the Office of the Dean of Students notifies any students not on aid of any deficiencies.\n\n**Minimum Course Completion Requirements**\n\nStudents need to earn at completion of their first year 7 credits, 15 credits at completion of second year, and, 24 credits after completing their third year at Middlebury.  Students who do not meet the minimum course completion requirements will not be considered to be making satisfactory academic progress until the deficiency is corrected.\n\n**Minimum Cumulative GPA**\n\nBy the second calendar year of enrollment in a post-secondary educational program, the student must have at least a 2.0 cumulative G.P.A. to be considered making satisfactory progress for continued participation in federal aid programs. Students who do not meet this test will be ineligible to participate in federal financial aid programs until this deficiency is corrected.\n\n**Maximum hours to earn degree:**  For the undergraduate program, the maximum time frame in which a student is expected to complete a program is six years, as the maximum time frame may not exceed 150% of the published length of the program measured in credit hours attempted. Undergraduate students at Middlebury College are allowed institutional aid for 8 semesters. The Dean of Students must approve a 9th semester of financial aid eligibility.\n\nStudents who are allowed by their Dean to continue their enrollment while on academic probationary status, will also be put on \"Financial Aid\" probation and will be expected to meet the same minimum standards outlined by the Dean for continued enrollment.\n\n**Financial Aid Warning**: Students who may be in jeopardy of losing their federal financial aid will be sent a warning letter which will remind them of the minimum academic requirements for federal aid and to take advantage of the academic services available to students. Students will still be able to receive federal student aid.\n\n**Financial Aid Probation**: If the student has not reached the maximum number of scheduled hours and the Financial Aid Appeals Committee determines that the student has fallen below the completion ratio standards for satisfactory progress, the student will be placed on Financial Aid Probation and notified that his/her continued eligibility for federal financial aid assistance is terminated. Students who fail to maintain the required minimum GPA will also be placed on financial aid probation.\n\nStudents on financial aid probation will receive a letter outlining the academic requirements the student must meet in order to receive aid for following semester. If the student on financial aid probation meets the terms of the probation, he/she will be permitted to continue to participate in the federal student aid programs for a subsequent semester. Students who have been placed on probation shall be considered to be making satisfactory academic progress for the purposes of receiving financial aid as long as the student continues to follow the academic plan outlined by their Dean. Students will normally be allowed only one probationary semester during their academic program. If the student does not meet the terms of the probation, the student will forfeit eligibility for all federal financial aid programs.\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Specific Circumstances</span>**\n\n**1\\. Repeated Courses**\n\nA student who fails a course and takes it a second time will have both grades calculated into the grade point average. If a student passes a course and then repeats it (after receiving permission of the Administration Committee), only the first grade is calculated into the grade point average, and the course is only counted once for credit, although both grades appear on the transcript. See also, “Grades and Transcripts” in the Middlebury Handbook for college undergraduates.\n\n**2\\. Multiple-Semester or Term Course Grades**\n\nWhen a course would have relatively little value unless followed by a second semester or term course intended to complement it, a department may designate first-semester courses for which no credit will be received without completion of a second semester of the course sequence. A department may designate second semester courses in which the final examination will cover the work of the entire year. Students must register each semester or term for the continuing credit. The first semester of such courses is graded Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory. Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory grades may be submitted only for multiple-semester or term projects carrying more than one course credit (500-honors projects for seniors, 700-level senior work). At the conclusion of the project, the student receives alphabetical grades for all course units.\n\n**3\\. Incomplete Grades**\n\nIncompletes are issued only in unanticipated, exceptional circumstances that arise near the end of the term and when a student has been meeting the majority of course expectations. Incompletes are granted by the Commons dean, after consultation with the faculty member involved. In order for the dean to grant an incomplete, the faculty member will provide the dean and the Registrar's Office with a provisional grade that would be assigned if the remaining work in the course were not completed. When the faculty member submits grades for the course, s/he will submit an incomplete for the student.\n\nThe dean will share the provisional grade with the student and will set the deadline for the submission of all remaining work, which will ordinarily be before the deadline for adding classes in the following Fall or Spring semester. The deadline may be no later than the deadline to drop classes in the following semester. Incompletes in winter term courses will follow the same procedures: the deadline for the submission of all remaining work may be no later than the deadline to drop classes in the Spring semester. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all work is completed by the deadline.  Should the faculty member be unavailable to evaluate the remaining work, it will be the responsibility of the department chair or program director, or designee, to complete the evaluation of submitted work. If the course is not completed by the deadline, the provisional grade based on the work that has been completed will be recorded by the Registrar's Office.\n\nIf the Registrar's Office has not received either a provisional or a final grade by the deadline, the grade will ordinarily be recorded as an F. The Registrar's Office will notify the student that the grade has been recorded. Students seeking incompletes based on a disability or medical condition should be directed to the Student Accessibility Services (SAS) Office. When the SAS staff determines that an incomplete is a reasonable accommodation for a disability, the dean will be notified and will grant the incomplete, which should ordinarily follow the procedures described above, unless the SAS Office determines a modification is necessary.\n\n4\\. **Withdrawals and Leaves of Absence**\n\nPlease see the [Student Status Policy](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/student-status) in the Middlebury Handbook for college undergraduates.\n\n**APPEAL PROCEDURE**\n\nStudents wishing to appeal their financial aid ineligibility and request a semester on financial aid probation **_or_ **who have exceeded the maximum timeframe for completing their degree must submit a letter to the Office of Student Financial Services (SFS) explaining the circumstances involved in their lack of academic progress. The SFS Appeals Committee will review the student’s request and make a final determination. Circumstances such as illness, death in the family, extreme financial hardship necessitating full-time employment or a change in educational objectives may be considered for extension of eligibility.\n\n_rev. 10/5/18_\n","excerpt":"This Policy applies to all undergraduate College students and is intended to ensure compliance with federal regulations.

Students who do not meet this test will be ineligible to participate in federal financial aid programs until this deficiency is corrected.</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum hours to earn degree:</strong>  For the undergraduate program, the maximum time frame in which a student is expected to complete a program is six years, as the maximum time frame may not exceed 150% of the published length of the program measured in credit hours attempted. Undergraduate students at Middlebury College are allowed institutional aid for 8 semesters. The Dean of Students must approve a 9th semester of financial aid eligibility.</p>\n<p>Students who are allowed by their Dean to continue their enrollment while on academic probationary status, will also be put on \"Financial Aid\" probation and will be expected to meet the same minimum standards outlined by the Dean for continued enrollment.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Aid Warning</strong>: Students who may be in jeopardy of losing their federal financial aid will be sent a warning letter which will remind them of the minimum academic requirements for federal aid and to take advantage of the academic services available to students.

Students who fail to maintain the required minimum GPA will also be placed on financial aid probation.</p>\n<p>Students on financial aid probation will receive a letter outlining the academic requirements the student must meet in order to receive aid for following semester. If the student on financial aid probation meets the terms of the probation, he/she will be permitted to continue to participate in the federal student aid programs for a subsequent semester. Students who have been placed on probation shall be considered to be making satisfactory academic progress for the purposes of receiving financial aid as long as the student continues to follow the academic plan outlined by their Dean. Students will normally be allowed only one probationary semester during their academic program. If the student does not meet the terms of the probation, the student will forfeit eligibility for all federal financial aid programs.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Specific Circumstances</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.

Student Status","body":"\nStudents may be admitted for undergraduate courses at Middlebury only if they do not already have a baccalaureate degree from Middlebury or any other institution.\n\n**1. Good Academic Standing**\n\nStudents are \"in good academic standing\" if they are meeting the requirements of the Satisfactory Academic Progress policy. Seniors who need only one or two courses to graduate and who have been approved for special student status are also considered to be \"in good academic standing.\"\n\n\"Successful completion of a year\" for veterans' benefits certification is defined as \"in good standing.\" Students taking fewer than four courses, however, should consult with the registrar regarding veterans' benefits.\n\n**2. Course Warnings**\n\nFaculty members may send out course warnings to students thought to be in danger of receiving grades of \"D\" or \"F.\"  The Commons dean will normally monitor grades around the middle of the term and may contact parents or guardians of students who appear to be having academic difficulties, including receiving one or more course warning.\n\n**3. Probation**\n\nSee [Grades and Transcripts](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/grades-transcripts). A student who receives two D grades or one failing grade and a D grade in a single semester will be placed on probation until the end of the following fall or spring semester. A student completing a semester with three units of credit who receives one D or one F will be placed on probation. A student who receives a D or an F in the winter term will be placed on probation for the spring semester. A student who receives a D or an F in summer study will be placed on probation for the fall semester. Students placed on probation more than twice in their College careers will be required to withdraw. A student readmitted after an academic failure is readmitted on probation for the following fall or spring semester.\n\n**4. Off-Campus Study**\n\nA student may be granted Off-Campus Study status to pursue a full-time program of studies at another recognized and accredited college or university in the United States or abroad. For details regarding the approval and transfer credit process for studying off-campus, see [Transfer Courses and Off-Campus Study](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/x-courses-ocs).\n\na. Off-Campus Study status for overseas programs is approved by the [Off-Campus Study](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/study-abroad) (Programs Abroad) Committee at the request of the student and the recommendation of his or her major department. Course programs must be approved by the appropriate Middlebury departments in advance to remain in good standing.\n\nb. Middlebury agrees to accept approved junior year abroad programs as equivalent to a full year's work. Students on other forms of leave have no such guarantee and must seek final approval of courses after their return to Middlebury. Students on Off-Campus Study status must inform the College if they withdraw from the institution they are attending or if they take a reduced course load.\n\nc.The following policies will govern readmission for students who have been approved for programs of Off-Campus Study and then wish to change their status:\n\ni. Such students will be readmitted for fall or spring semester only. They will not be readmitted for summer study or for winter term, regardless of the plan for housing.\n\nii. The deadline for guaranteed readmission for the fall semester is June 15\\. After this date, students who wish to be readmitted will be placed on a waiting list. Students on the waiting list will be notified on September 1 if they have been readmitted for the fall.\n\niii. The deadline for guaranteed readmission for the spring semester is November 15\\. After this date, students who wish to be readmitted will be placed on a waiting list. Students on the waiting list will be notified on January 15 if they have been readmitted for the spring.\n\niv. There will be no readmissions after the September 1 and January 15 dates.\n\n**5. Leaves of Absence**\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">a. Voluntary Leaves of Absence</span>\n\ni. Students may choose to take a leave of absence during their time at Middlebury.  They may choose not to return after a successfully completed semester, or they may choose to take a leave during a semester in progress. If they choose to withdraw from a semester in progress prior to December 1 for the fall semester or May 1 for the spring semester, no courses will appear on their transcript. (A course with a failing grade assessed as a penalty for academic dishonesty by the Academic Judicial Board will not be removed from a transcript regardless of the timing.)\n\nii.  Students who withdraw in the middle of a semester are ordinarily eligible for readmission after a full semester away.  If they withdraw from a semester after December 1 (fall) or May 1 (spring), their courses will remain on the transcript. Students who withdraw during winter term or summer study will receive a grade of F for that that term. Any student wishing to take a leave of absence should consult with his or her Commons dean.\n\niii.  Leaves of absence when there is a pending disciplinary matter are addressed in [Section B.2.a.iv. Pending Discipline](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/a-introductory-matters).\n\niv.  Repeated or Extended Leaves:  A student who has taken three leaves from Middlebury, including any withdrawal for academic failure or mandatory leave of absence, or who has taken a leave of absence in excess of three years, may no longer be eligible for the regular re-admission process. A student in these circumstances who wishes to return to Middlebury should petition for re-enrollment by the Administration Committee.  The more extensive process of a petition for re-enrollment asks the student to document in some detail their readiness to return to Middlebury’s rigorous academic environment, including, as appropriate, how the student’s situation has changed or developed, to support a successful return.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">b.  Mandatory Leave of Absence</span>\n\ni. Middlebury College provides a range of support services to address the medical needs of students, including mental health needs, within the context of the campus community. On occasion, students may experience health needs requiring a level of care that exceeds what the College can appropriately provide. In such circumstances, students may take a voluntary leave of absence. In situations where a student is unable or unwilling to carry out substantial self-care obligations, where their behavior is unduly disruptive to the community, where current medical knowledge and/or the best available objective evidence indicates that a student poses a significant risk to the health or safety of others, or where a student poses an actual risk to their own safety not based on mere speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals with disabilities, and the student does not want to take a leave voluntarily, the Vice President of Student Affairs has the authority to place the student on a mandatory leave of absence.\n\nii. Before placing any student on a mandatory leave of absence, Middlebury will do an individualized assessment to determine if there are reasonable accommodations that would permit the student to continue to participate in the campus community without taking a leave of absence.  A medical evaluation by a competent specialist may be required. To enable careful, individualized consideration, the student may need to sign a release authorizing disclosure of relevant information by and between treatment providers working with the student and the appropriate College official(s).\n\niii. The student will be notified of the decision to place him or her on leave in writing. Student(s) will be given notice and an opportunity to speak with their Commons dean prior to or within five business days following the start of the mandatory leave.  The decision may be appealed, following the procedures set forth in Section 5.b.iv., below.\n\niv. An appeal of a mandatory leave of absence may be made in writing (including email) to the vice president for Academic Affairs / dean of the faculty (VPAA/DOF) or designee within five business days of receipt of the decision. The appeal must state the grounds for the appeal and include any supporting evidence. The VPAA/DOF will ordinarily notify the student of the appeal decision within ten business days of receipt of the appeal.\n\nv. Students placed on leave under this section may also be subject to the normal disciplinary processes if their conduct has violated College policy. If disciplinary action is appropriate, the matter must be resolved either before or immediately upon the student’s return.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">c.  Temporary Medical Leave of Absence</span>\n\ni. A student may request a temporary medical leave of absence for up to ten days. A temporary leave beyond ten days will only be granted in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nii. The College may place the student on a temporary mandatory leave of absence for up to ten days when the conditions for a mandatory leave of absence, above, are met.  Whenever possible, the student will be given notice and an opportunity to speak with their Commons dean prior to or within three business days following the start of the temporary leave. The student’s Commons dean, in consultation with others as appropriate, will make a determination as to the student’s request after reviewing the information submitted. There is no right of appeal.\n\n- Students who are placed on temporary medical leave may also be subject to the normal disciplinary processes when their conduct has violated College policy. If disciplinary action is appropriate, the matter must be resolved either before or immediately upon the student’s return.\n- Students may return from their temporary medical leave after providing documentation and information in accordance with Section 5.d., below.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">d. Readmission</span>\n\ni. Students on leave are eligible for readmission for a three-year period, and many students who take a leave will have no requirements attached to their readmission. In some cases, a Dean or the VPSA may impose specific requirements for readmission if the circumstances of the student’s departure warrant it. The goal of such conditions is to prepare the student for a successful return to Middlebury; for example, a student may be asked to complete pre-approved coursework at another institution in order to demonstrate readiness to return to rigorous academic work or to provide clinical information to staff of the Parton Center for Health & Wellness to facilitate a successful return.  For example, student may need to complete the Medical Return Form and respond to any follow-up requests for information from Parton staff.  If the leave is health-related, any conditions or requirements for reinstatement will be based on an individualized assessment of each student including consideration of current medical knowledge and/or the best available objective evidence. Careful consideration will be given to the opinions and recommendations of the student’s treating physician or mental health professional, if available.\n\n- As appropriate to the individual circumstances of a student’s departure, a Dean or VPSA may also require that the student provide information to their Commons Dean when they seek readmission.  Typically, this includes a letter about the student's understanding of the problem that led to the leave, evidence of the student’s work to resolve the issue and/or progress made in managing the issue and other information that may assist the College in evaluating whether the student can safely and effectively participate in the residential academic programs of the College.\n\nii. Students eligible for readmission can expect to receive instructions for completing the online readmission forms from their Commons dean. They must confirm their plan to return on this readmission date with their Commons dean no later than June 15 for the fall term and November 1 for the spring semester. Normally, readmission is for fall or spring semester only. Students will be readmitted for winter term or summer study only with special permission from the Vice President for Student Affairs.\n\niii. Students on probation for disciplinary or academic reasons will resume their probationary status upon their return for the duration of the assigned probationary period.\n\niv. In the rare circumstance that a student’s request for readmission is denied on grounds of health or safety, the decision may be appealed in writing to the Vice President for Student Affairs, or in appropriate, to the VPAA/Dean of the Faculty.\n\n**6\\.** **Accommodations for Students with Disabilities**\n\nMiddleburyis committed to ensuring equal access to its educational programs for students with disabilities. The term \"disability\" may include learning, physical, sensory, psychological, medical, and certain temporary disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 as amended, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (504), and anlaoguous state laws prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities and entitle individuals with disabilities to reasonable accommodations. Students with disabilities may request academic accommodations; housing and dining accommodations; modifications to University policies, rules, and regulations; environmental adjustments such as the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers; and auxiliary aids and services. Additional policies and procedures regarding accommodations can be found on the website of Student Accessibility Services and in Middlebury’s [Americans with Disabilities Act Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/ada-policy).\n\nStudents with disabilities who seek accommodations must register with Student Accessibility Services. Registration through self-identification is a voluntary process that is treated confidentially and may occur at any time during the student's course of study. Such students may seek modifications of the academic regulations set forth herein as accommodations from SAS, which may refer certain requests to the [Administration Committee](https://www.middlebury.edu/college/student-life/academic-life).\n\n**7.  Withdrawal Due to Academic Failure**\n\nA student who receives two F grades, three D grades, or one F grade and two D grades during a fall or spring semester earns an academic failure and is required to withdraw. Seventh-semester seniors may petition to be reviewed by the Administration Committee prior to final action.\n\nA student on probation who receives one F grade or two D grades in the subsequent fall or spring semester is required to withdraw.\n\nA student who receives D or an F in the winter term or in summer study while on probation will be required to withdraw. Students placed on probation more than twice in their College career will be required to withdraw.\n\nA student who is enrolled in three courses and receives one F and one D grade, or two D grades, will be required to withdraw. A student enrolled in three courses who is on probation and who receives one D grade will be required to withdraw.\n\nThe above rules also apply to Middlebury undergraduates who enroll in Language Schools, Schools Abroad, Bread Loaf School of English, School of the Environment, and externally sponsored programs approved by the office of International Programs and Off-Campus Study. Students withdrawn due to academic failure are not eligible to attend any Middlebury school or program until formally readmitted to the College.\n\nAt any time, a student failing a course, consistently receiving grades below C-, or in any way neglecting the obligations of a course, may be placed on course warning.\n\nStudents failing in their studies generally may be withdrawn from the College by the Administration Committee if, in its judgment, failure is due to lack of application or to a negligent attitude.\n\n**8\\. Readmission After Withdrawal for Academic Failure**\n\nA student withdrawn for academic failure will not be readmitted except by special action of the [Administration Committee](https://www.middlebury.edu/college/student-life/academic-life). Readmission is a special privilege, not a right. The committee will take favorable action only when it is satisfied that the factors which led to failure have been rectified and that the student has both ample motivation and capacity to earn a degree. Mere lapse of time is not a sufficient basis for readmission. The burden of proof of motivation and capacity rests with the student. The student is normally required to enroll full-time at another accredited institution and to achieve a good record there by receiving grades of B- or better in all courses. (See [Transfer Courses and Off-Campus Study](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/x-courses-ocs) for information about the transferability of these courses to Middlebury.)\n\nApplication for readmission must be made to the [Administration Committee](https://www.middlebury.edu/college/student-life/academic-life), who will consult with the student's Commons dean. Application must be made by June 1 for fall semester, and by November 1 for spring semester. Students found to be in academic failure in the spring semester and who request immediate readmission for the following fall must apply by June 15\\. The Administration Committee may defer action on these applications until an official transcript showing work completed at another institution has been received at Middlebury. Normally, readmission is for fall or spring semester only. Students will be readmitted for winter term or for summer study only with special permission from the Administration Committee in consultation with the student's Commons dean. Any student readmitted will be on probation for the first semester following return and, if withdrawn a second time, will not be readmitted. A student readmitted on probation for winter term remains on probation for spring semester; a student readmitted on probation for summer study remains on probation for fall semester.\n\n**<a name=\"special\" id=\"special\"></a>9. Special Students**\n\nSpecial student status is designated for students with only one or two remaining courses (although Febs may apply for special student status for the fall semester when they have three remaining courses), and for students with a documented disability for which this arrangement is deemed by the Student Accessibility Services staff to be a reasonable accommodation. Special students are charged by the course, and may not live on campus.\n\nStudents applying for special student status based on course completion must submit a completed Special Student application to the Office of the Registrar for approval. Students applying for special student status based on a documented disability must submit their request, along with appropriate documentation, to the Student Accessibility Services office. [Applications for special student status](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/academic/records/Forms/stuforms) must ordinarily be filed with the Office of the Registrar by March 15 for the fall semester and November 15 for the spring semester. Students whose circumstances change after March 15 or November 15 may file applications for special student status after those deadlines if they have compelling reasons.\n\nOccasionally, special students wish to remain living and eating on campus. When this request is based on a documented disability, students should submit this request to the Student Accessibility Services office. When this request is based on exceptional personal circumstances, students may apply to the Administration Committee.\n\n**10\\. Ninth Semester**\n\nAs stated in section B.1.c, Degree Requirements, the normal pattern for earning the baccalaureate degree at Middlebury College is four consecutive years of study.  If, due to extenuating circumstances, a student is unable to successfully complete all degree requirements within eight semesters, the student must petition the Administration Committee for permission to enroll in a ninth semester.  All semesters in which a student attends classes, including any semester(s) from which a student withdraws before the end of the semester, are included in the eight-semester count.  Petitions for a ninth semester are only considered in cases where the student can demonstrate that, due to no fault of their own, and based upon extraordinary circumstances, the student is unable to complete the degree within eight semesters.  Requests for a ninth semester to complete a second major or to accommodate a late change of major will not be considered.\n\n**11. Visiting Students**\n\nStudents from other colleges may be admitted through the Administration Committee, if space is available, for one semester as non-matriculated students. Such students are required to be in good academic and social standing at their home institutions and have the approval of their home institutions. The Administration Committee will review potential visiting students' applications and transcripts and proposed courses of study at Middlebury to ensure that the students meet academic standards and that there is room in the courses they plan to take. Any visiting student wishing to transfer to Middlebury must apply in the regular manner through the Admissions Office.\n\n**12. Resignation**\n\nStudents who wish to leave Middlebury College and plan never to return may resign from the College. Students who resign must notify the dean of their Commons in writing. There is no readmission after a resignation.\n\n**13. Refunds**\n\nIn cases of dismissal from the College, no refund of the comprehensive fee is made. In other cases of absence or withdrawal from the College for medical reasons or serious emergencies, fees are refunded according to the [College’s refund schedule](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/student-financial-services/financial-tools-and-resources/student-financial-services-handbook). In all cases, the enrollment deposit is forfeited.\n","excerpt":"Students may be admitted for undergraduate courses at Middlebury only if they do not already have a baccalaureate degree from Middlebury or…","html":"<p>Students may be admitted for undergraduate courses at Middlebury only if they do not already have a baccalaureate degree from Middlebury or any other institution.</p>\n<p><strong>1.

Course programs must be approved by the appropriate Middlebury departments in advance to remain in good standing.</p>\n<p>b. Middlebury agrees to accept approved junior year abroad programs as equivalent to a full year's work. Students on other forms of leave have no such guarantee and must seek final approval of courses after their return to Middlebury. Students on Off-Campus Study status must inform the College if they withdraw from the institution they are attending or if they take a reduced course load.</p>\n<p>c.The following policies will govern readmission for students who have been approved for programs of Off-Campus Study and then wish to change their status:</p>\n<p>i. Such students will be readmitted for fall or spring semester only. They will not be readmitted for summer study or for winter term, regardless of the plan for housing.</p>\n<p>ii. The deadline for guaranteed readmission for the fall semester is June 15. After this date, students who wish to be readmitted will be placed on a waiting list. Students on the waiting list will be notified on September 1 if they have been readmitted for the fall.</p>\n<p>iii. The deadline for guaranteed readmission for the spring semester is November 15. After this date, students who wish to be readmitted will be placed on a waiting list. Students on the waiting list will be notified on January 15 if they have been readmitted for the spring.</p>\n<p>iv. There will be no readmissions after the September 1 and January 15 dates.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Leaves of Absence</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">a. Voluntary Leaves of Absence</span></p>\n<p>i. Students may choose to take a leave of absence during their time at Middlebury.  They may choose not to return after a successfully completed semester, or they may choose to take a leave during a semester in progress. If they choose to withdraw from a semester in progress prior to December 1 for the fall semester or May 1 for the spring semester, no courses will appear on their transcript. (A course with a failing grade assessed as a penalty for academic dishonesty by the Academic Judicial Board will not be removed from a transcript regardless of the timing.)</p>\n<p>ii.  Students who withdraw in the middle of a semester are ordinarily eligible for readmission after a full semester away.  If they withdraw from a semester after December 1 (fall) or May 1 (spring), their courses will remain on the transcript. Students who withdraw during winter term or summer study will receive a grade of F for that that term. Any student wishing to take a leave of absence should consult with his or her Commons dean.</p>\n<p>iii.  Leaves of absence when there is a pending disciplinary matter are addressed in <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/a-introductory-matters\">Section B.2.a.iv. Pending Discipline</a>.</p>\n<p>iv.  Repeated or Extended Leaves:  A student who has taken three leaves from Middlebury, including any withdrawal for academic failure or mandatory leave of absence, or who has taken a leave of absence in excess of three years, may no longer be eligible for the regular re-admission process. A student in these circumstances who wishes to return to Middlebury should petition for re-enrollment by the Administration Committee.  The more extensive process of a petition for re-enrollment asks the student to document in some detail their readiness to return to Middlebury’s rigorous academic environment, including, as appropriate, how the student’s situation has changed or developed, to support a successful return.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">b.  Mandatory Leave of Absence</span></p>\n<p>i. Middlebury College provides a range of support services to address the medical needs of students, including mental health needs, within the context of the campus community. On occasion, students may experience health needs requiring a level of care that exceeds what the College can appropriately provide. In such circumstances, students may take a voluntary leave of absence. In situations where a student is unable or unwilling to carry out substantial self-care obligations, where their behavior is unduly disruptive to the community, where current medical knowledge and/or the best available objective evidence indicates that a student poses a significant risk to the health or safety of others, or where a student poses an actual risk to their own safety not based on mere speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals with disabilities, and the student does not want to take a leave voluntarily, the Vice President of Student Affairs has the authority to place the student on a mandatory leave of absence.</p>\n<p>ii. Before placing any student on a mandatory leave of absence, Middlebury will do an individualized assessment to determine if there are reasonable accommodations that would permit the student to continue to participate in the campus community without taking a leave of absence.  A medical evaluation by a competent specialist may be required. To enable careful, individualized consideration, the student may need to sign a release authorizing disclosure of relevant information by and between treatment providers working with the student and the appropriate College official(s).</p>\n<p>iii. The student will be notified of the decision to place him or her on leave in writing. Student(s) will be given notice and an opportunity to speak with their Commons dean prior to or within five business days following the start of the mandatory leave.  The decision may be appealed, following the procedures set forth in Section 5.b.iv., below.</p>\n<p>iv. An appeal of a mandatory leave of absence may be made in writing (including email) to the vice president for Academic Affairs / dean of the faculty (VPAA/DOF) or designee within five business days of receipt of the decision. The appeal must state the grounds for the appeal and include any supporting evidence. The VPAA/DOF will ordinarily notify the student of the appeal decision within ten business days of receipt of the appeal.</p>\n<p>v. Students placed on leave under this section may also be subject to the normal disciplinary processes if their conduct has violated College policy. If disciplinary action is appropriate, the matter must be resolved either before or immediately upon the student’s return.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">c.  Temporary Medical Leave of Absence</span></p>\n<p>i. A student may request a temporary medical leave of absence for up to ten days. A temporary leave beyond ten days will only be granted in extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p>ii. The College may place the student on a temporary mandatory leave of absence for up to ten days when the conditions for a mandatory leave of absence, above, are met.  Whenever possible, the student will be given notice and an opportunity to speak with their Commons dean prior to or within three business days following the start of the temporary leave. The student’s Commons dean, in consultation with others as appropriate, will make a determination as to the student’s request after reviewing the information submitted. There is no right of appeal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students who are placed on temporary medical leave may also be subject to the normal disciplinary processes when their conduct has violated College policy. If disciplinary action is appropriate, the matter must be resolved either before or immediately upon the student’s return.</li>\n<li>Students may return from their temporary medical leave after providing documentation and information in accordance with Section 5.d., below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">d. Readmission</span></p>\n<p>i. Students on leave are eligible for readmission for a three-year period, and many students who take a leave will have no requirements attached to their readmission. In some cases, a Dean or the VPSA may impose specific requirements for readmission if the circumstances of the student’s departure warrant it. The goal of such conditions is to prepare the student for a successful return to Middlebury; for example, a student may be asked to complete pre-approved coursework at another institution in order to demonstrate readiness to return to rigorous academic work or to provide clinical information to staff of the Parton Center for Health &#x26; Wellness to facilitate a successful return.  For example, student may need to complete the Medical Return Form and respond to any follow-up requests for information from Parton staff.  If the leave is health-related, any conditions or requirements for reinstatement will be based on an individualized assessment of each student including consideration of current medical knowledge and/or the best available objective evidence. Careful consideration will be given to the opinions and recommendations of the student’s treating physician or mental health professional, if available.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As appropriate to the individual circumstances of a student’s departure, a Dean or VPSA may also require that the student provide information to their Commons Dean when they seek readmission.  Typically, this includes a letter about the student's understanding of the problem that led to the leave, evidence of the student’s work to resolve the issue and/or progress made in managing the issue and other information that may assist the College in evaluating whether the student can safely and effectively participate in the residential academic programs of the College.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ii. Students eligible for readmission can expect to receive instructions for completing the online readmission forms from their Commons dean. They must confirm their plan to return on this readmission date with their Commons dean no later than June 15 for the fall term and November 1 for the spring semester. Normally, readmission is for fall or spring semester only. Students will be readmitted for winter term or summer study only with special permission from the Vice President for Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>iii. Students on probation for disciplinary or academic reasons will resume their probationary status upon their return for the duration of the assigned probationary period.</p>\n<p>iv. In the rare circumstance that a student’s request for readmission is denied on grounds of health or safety, the decision may be appealed in writing to the Vice President for Student Affairs, or in appropriate, to the VPAA/Dean of the Faculty.</p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</strong></p>\n<p>Middleburyis committed to ensuring equal access to its educational programs for students with disabilities. The term \"disability\" may include learning, physical, sensory, psychological, medical, and certain temporary disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 as amended, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (504), and anlaoguous state laws prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities and entitle individuals with disabilities to reasonable accommodations. Students with disabilities may request academic accommodations; housing and dining accommodations; modifications to University policies, rules, and regulations; environmental adjustments such as the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers; and auxiliary aids and services. Additional policies and procedures regarding accommodations can be found on the website of Student Accessibility Services and in Middlebury’s <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/ada-policy\">Americans with Disabilities Act Policy</a>.</p>\n<p>Students with disabilities who seek accommodations must register with Student Accessibility Services. Registration through self-identification is a voluntary process that is treated confidentially and may occur at any time during the student's course of study. Such students may seek modifications of the academic regulations set forth herein as accommodations from SAS, which may refer certain requests to the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/college/student-life/academic-life\">Administration Committee</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>7.  Withdrawal Due to Academic Failure</strong></p>\n<p>A student who receives two F grades, three D grades, or one F grade and two D grades during a fall or spring semester earns an academic failure and is required to withdraw. Seventh-semester seniors may petition to be reviewed by the Administration Committee prior to final action.</p>\n<p>A student on probation who receives one F grade or two D grades in the subsequent fall or spring semester is required to withdraw.</p>\n<p>A student who receives D or an F in the winter term or in summer study while on probation will be required to withdraw. Students placed on probation more than twice in their College career will be required to withdraw.</p>\n<p>A student who is enrolled in three courses and receives one F and one D grade, or two D grades, will be required to withdraw. A student enrolled in three courses who is on probation and who receives one D grade will be required to withdraw.</p>\n<p>The above rules also apply to Middlebury undergraduates who enroll in Language Schools, Schools Abroad, Bread Loaf School of English, School of the Environment, and externally sponsored programs approved by the office of International Programs and Off-Campus Study. Students withdrawn due to academic failure are not eligible to attend any Middlebury school or program until formally readmitted to the College.</p>\n<p>At any time, a student failing a course, consistently receiving grades below C-, or in any way neglecting the obligations of a course, may be placed on course warning.</p>\n<p>Students failing in their studies generally may be withdrawn from the College by the Administration Committee if, in its judgment, failure is due to lack of application or to a negligent attitude.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Readmission After Withdrawal for Academic Failure</strong></p>\n<p>A student withdrawn for academic failure will not be readmitted except by special action of the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/college/student-life/academic-life\">Administration Committee</a>. Readmission is a special privilege, not a right. The committee will take favorable action only when it is satisfied that the factors which led to failure have been rectified and that the student has both ample motivation and capacity to earn a degree. Mere lapse of time is not a sufficient basis for readmission. The burden of proof of motivation and capacity rests with the student. The student is normally required to enroll full-time at another accredited institution and to achieve a good record there by receiving grades of B- or better in all courses. (See <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/x-courses-ocs\">Transfer Courses and Off-Campus Study</a> for information about the transferability of these courses to Middlebury.)</p>\n<p>Application for readmission must be made to the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/college/student-life/academic-life\">Administration Committee</a>, who will consult with the student's Commons dean. Application must be made by June 1 for fall semester, and by November 1 for spring semester. Students found to be in academic failure in the spring semester and who request immediate readmission for the following fall must apply by June 15. The Administration Committee may defer action on these applications until an official transcript showing work completed at another institution has been received at Middlebury. Normally, readmission is for fall or spring semester only. Students will be readmitted for winter term or for summer study only with special permission from the Administration Committee in consultation with the student's Commons dean. Any student readmitted will be on probation for the first semester following return and, if withdrawn a second time, will not be readmitted. A student readmitted on probation for winter term remains on probation for spring semester; a student readmitted on probation for summer study remains on probation for fall semester.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"special\" id=\"special\"></a>9. Special Students</strong></p>\n<p>Special student status is designated for students with only one or two remaining courses (although Febs may apply for special student status for the fall semester when they have three remaining courses), and for students with a documented disability for which this arrangement is deemed by the Student Accessibility Services staff to be a reasonable accommodation. Special students are charged by the course, and may not live on campus.</p>\n<p>Students applying for special student status based on course completion must submit a completed Special Student application to the Office of the Registrar for approval. Students applying for special student status based on a documented disability must submit their request, along with appropriate documentation, to the Student Accessibility Services office. <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/academic/records/Forms/stuforms\">Applications for special student status</a> must ordinarily be filed with the Office of the Registrar by March 15 for the fall semester and November 15 for the spring semester. Students whose circumstances change after March 15 or November 15 may file applications for special student status after those deadlines if they have compelling reasons.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, special students wish to remain living and eating on campus. When this request is based on a documented disability, students should submit this request to the Student Accessibility Services office. When this request is based on exceptional personal circumstances, students may apply to the Administration Committee.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Ninth Semester</strong></p>\n<p>As stated in section B.1.c, Degree Requirements, the normal pattern for earning the baccalaureate degree at Middlebury College is four consecutive years of study.  If, due to extenuating circumstances, a student is unable to successfully complete all degree requirements within eight semesters, the student must petition the Administration Committee for permission to enroll in a ninth semester.  All semesters in which a student attends classes, including any semester(s) from which a student withdraws before the end of the semester, are included in the eight-semester count.  Petitions for a ninth semester are only considered in cases where the student can demonstrate that, due to no fault of their own, and based upon extraordinary circumstances, the student is unable to complete the degree within eight semesters.  Requests for a ninth semester to complete a second major or to accommodate a late change of major will not be considered.</p>\n<p><strong>11. Visiting Students</strong></p>\n<p>Students from other colleges may be admitted through the Administration Committee, if space is available, for one semester as non-matriculated students. Such students are required to be in good academic and social standing at their home institutions and have the approval of their home institutions. The Administration Committee will review potential visiting students' applications and transcripts and proposed courses of study at Middlebury to ensure that the students meet academic standards and that there is room in the courses they plan to take. Any visiting student wishing to transfer to Middlebury must apply in the regular manner through the Admissions Office.</p>\n<p><strong>12. Resignation</strong></p>\n<p>Students who wish to leave Middlebury College and plan never to return may resign from the College. Students who resign must notify the dean of their Commons in writing. There is no readmission after a resignation.</p>\n<p><strong>13. Refunds</strong></p>\n<p>In cases of dismissal from the College, no refund of the comprehensive fee is made. In other cases of absence or withdrawal from the College for medical reasons or serious emergencies, fees are refunded according to the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/office/student-financial-services/financial-tools-and-resources/student-financial-services-handbook\">College’s refund schedule</a>. In all cases, the enrollment deposit is forfeited.</p>"},"81c3e8f3-6fd5-5dcc-b301-c5a69a7508bf":{"id":"81c3e8f3-6fd5-5dcc-b301-c5a69a7508bf","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/summer-study","title":"B.1.g.

The same grading system applies to all students taking a particular course for credit. Winter Term courses are graded on an A-F basis unless special arrangements are made through the Curriculum Committee (e.g., occasional independent projects or other courses where the instructor decides that the special nature of the course is better suited to honors/pass/fail grading). Exceptions are internships and student-led courses, which are graded credit/no credit. All winter term course work must be completed by the end of the winter term. Grades of incomplete will be submitted according to existing procedures, and such work must be satisfactorily completed by the last day of classes of the following spring term.\n\n**2.  Winter Term Course Structure and General Procedures**\n\na. Departments are encouraged to designate winter term courses as acceptable for credit toward majors and minors. Unless an exception is granted by the Curriculum Committee, enrollment will normally be limited to 22 students per instructor in any winter term course, 38 for a team-taught course, and 18 for language courses (per instructor). The enrollment limit for a winter term course that satisfies the College Writing requirement will be 12 students.\n\nb. All members of the faculty not on leave or released time are expected to contribute regularly to the winter term curriculum. During winter term, faculty and students are involved in only one academic credit bearing course, providing unique opportunities for study. Among these are extensive field work, independent study, internships, senior work, and interdisciplinary study. A minimum of eight contact hours per week is required for all winter term courses.\n\nc. A minimum of two and a maximum of four winter term courses will count toward the graduation requirement.  Winter term courses may be integrated with fall or spring semester course sequences. A fall semester course may be a prerequisite for a winter term course, or a winter term course may be a prerequisite for a spring semester course.\n\nd. A department normally may require its students to take no more than one of its winter term courses, in addition to winter term senior work, during four years. Students are urged to take winter term courses in substantially different academic areas in their first and second years. Over four years a student may take no more than three winter term courses in one department, and no more than two winter term courses, in addition to winter term senior work, in his or her major department. A student may take up to four interdepartmental winter term courses during these four years.\n\ne. Upper class students with sufficient credits may elect not to participate in winter term, but no student may remain on campus during winter term unless he or she is enrolled in a winter term course, credit-bearing independent project, on-campus internship, or off-campus internship in the local community.\n\nf. Students who fail winter term courses or independent winter projects will be placed on probation and required to make up a course credit.\n\nTheses, honors projects, and other work undertaken or completed during winter term as part of a larger project will be graded under the regular grading system; the grade to be based upon an evaluation of the project as a whole.\n\ng. Winter term course registration:\n\ni. A student must be in residence and enroll in a regular winter term course during his or her first winter term. This includes both September and February matriculates.\n\nii. Students complete their registration during the registration period in early November. Students who are not on campus during the fall semester may register for winter term online in BannerWeb during the online winter term registration period.\n\niii. Changes in course registration may be made only during the first three days on which classes meet during winter term. Due to time constraints during winter term, late adds are automatically charged a late fee of $50.\n\niv. A student who misses the first class of winter term must be excused by a Commons dean or it will be assumed that the student has dropped the course.\n\nv. The registration windows for winter term open as follows: (1) students with 8-16.99 credits earned; (2) students with 3-7.99 credits earned; (3) students with 17-36+ credits earned.\n\n**3\\. Student Options for Winter Term**\n\nStudents are required to earn Middlebury credits during two winter terms. All first-year students must enroll in a winter term course on the Middlebury campus. This includes both September and February matriculates. The second credit may be earned by enrolling in a winter term course, a credit-bearing independent project, a credit-bearing internship, or by studying abroad and earning winter term equivalent credit. (A minimum of two and a maximum of four winter term courses will count toward the graduation requirement of 36 course credits.)\n\n_a. Independent Projects (0500 Work)_\n\nStudents with 8 or more credits may submit a proposal to their faculty sponsor for on or off-campus winter term independent work either as a continuation of their major or minor or as work outside of their major or minor as long as:\n\n- They have not completed more than two units of winter term independent work; and\n\n- They have received the approval of the chair or director of the department or program in which the work will be completed\n\n**_Students are not allowed to pursue independent projects during their first winter term._**\n\n**_How to Apply_**: Contact a faculty member in the department/program in which the work will be done to ask if they will advise the project; once approved by the faculty member, the student should register for that faculty member's independent project section during the registration period (or by add card after the registration period has ended).  \n**_Deadline:_ Ongoing until the Add Deadline**\n\n_b. Winter Term Internships_\n\nWinter term internships involve significant high-level exposure to the fundamental work of an organization, with ties to a student's academic and/or professional interests. They challenge students to apply their liberal arts learning in a real-world setting, and provide students with an opportunity to reflect meaningfully on the connections between their classroom learning and their outside-the-classroom experiences. Internships can be pursued during winter term and students can apply for the opportunity to earn academic credit for their work in reflecting upon, and making meaning of, the internship experience. The Curriculum Committee oversees this process, in partnership with individual faculty members and with the Center for Careers & Internships (CCI). To apply, students identify an internship opportunity and a faculty member whom they wish to advise them in connection with the internship. If the faculty member agrees that the internship provides a worthwhile opportunity for the application of liberal arts learning, the student and faculty member together develop a plan for the academic work that will express the student’s thoughtful reflection on the internship and its connections to their learning. The student then submits the faculty member’s approval and supporting documentation to the Center for Careers & Internships (CCI), as detailed on the <span>CCI website</span>. Students in these approved winter term internships spend a minimum of 25 hours per week (or 100 hours total) at their internship site, and complete the agreed upon academic work. At the end of the internship, the student, the faculty member, and the on-site work supervisor submit evaluation reports. The faculty member grades the student’s work in response to the internship on a Credit/No Credit basis. Students with fewer than 8 credits may not undertake winter term internships for credit, and students who take more than one internship in four years should pursue them in substantially different fields. A student may not repeat the same winter term internship for credit. A relative may not function as an internship supervisor. If the internship is in a non-English speaking-country, the committee will expect competence in the language of that country, although exceptions apply. Students can also pursue internships during winter term without receiving academic credit. More information about internship opportunities and the application process for winter term internship credit is available from CCI in Adirondack House (visit the internship pages on the CCI web site at <span>go/internships</span> or contact Cheryl Whitney Lower, ext. 5798). More information about the faculty member’s role, appropriate academic work in connection with internships, and grading of such work is available from the dean of curriculum (contact Emily Proctor, ext. 5954).\n\n_c. Study Abroad During Winter Term_\n\nProposals/applications for study abroad in an accredited program for winter term credit must be submitted to International Programs.  These proposals do NOT need to be submitted to the Curriculum Committee. Students must apply to International Programs by the advertised deadline for pre-approval of winter term off-campus courses. No courses/programs will be approved after the fact. Programs must be at least four complete weeks long (regardless of the total number of contact hours) to earn a maximum of one unit of Middlebury credit. The program/course must meet for at least the same number of hours, over the four weeks, as an equivalent Middlebury course. A program that meets more than 36 hours will NOT receive additional credit. Only a program/course that meets the definition of \"liberal arts\" (in other words, students should not take courses that are of a pre-professional nature such as business, journalism, etc.), and receives a letter grade of C- or better, may be applied to the Middlebury College degree.  Programs/courses graded on a pass/fail basis or audited are NOT transferable. The transcript reflecting work completed must be issued by an accredited institution of higher education. Students will be notified if credit is pre-approved after International Programs reviews their applications. For more information and the application, please see [https://www.middlebury.edu/international/73780/programs/winter_term](https://www.middlebury.edu/international/73780/programs/winter_term).  **Deadline: As advertised by International Programs**\n\n_d. Opting Out of Winter Term_\n\n<span>Students who elect not to participate in winter term MUST still participate in winter term registration by enrolling in the No-Credit, “Opt-Out” option. Students registering for this No-Credit option will not receive academic credit during winter term, and will not be eligible to remain on campus. This option is not available to students who are participating in their first winter term, i.e., regardless of whether they are September or February matriculates. Students participating as a member of a Middlebury College winter team sport MUST be enrolled in an academic credit-bearing course during winter term.</span>\n\n_e. Winter Term Student Led Courses_\n\nProposals for student-led courses may be submitted to the Curriculum Committee. Such proposals will ordinarily originate with a student or group of students. The proposals must be reviewed and supported by a department or program prior to their submission to the Curriculum Committee. The participants in a student-led course are normally presumed to have studied at the college level in areas relevant to the proposed course. However, some student-led courses may be designed to provide an intensive introduction to a new area. The number of participants in student-led courses may normally be no fewer than five and no more than 12.\n\nThe chair or director of the department/program supporting the course will forward, via email to Kathleen Parent, a written endorsement of the student leader and will designate a faculty supervisor for the proposed course. The designated faculty supervisor will also forward, via email to Kathleen Parent, a statement accepting this role. The Curriculum Committee will consider this information along with the course proposal form. The student leader will organize and conduct the course and propose its syllabus. Student leaders shall consult with the faculty supervisor on a regular basis. The faculty supervisor shall determine credit. These courses are graded Credit/No Credit. Student-led courses are subject to the following restrictions:\n\ni. The proposal should be submitted to the Curriculum Committee by the end of the second week of the fall semester.   \n**Deadline: September 22, 2017.**\n\nii. A proposal must include a departmental recommendation of the course and its leader, a detailed syllabus, and a list of interested students who will participate in the course if it is offered. Proposed work assignments and meeting schedules must also be submitted.\n\niii. If the student leader drops the course, it will be canceled automatically.\n\n_rev. 7/28/17_\n","excerpt":"1. General a. The Curriculum Committee is responsible for the general administration of the winter term academic program. All courses must…","html":"<p><strong>1. General</strong></p>\n<p>a. The Curriculum Committee is responsible for the general administration of the winter term academic program. All courses must be approved by the Curriculum Committee; the Committee may make or suggest adjustments in proposed courses in consultation with the departments concerned.</p>\n<p>b. Each course proposal should contain the following items: title, description, class format, prerequisites, maximum effective size, budgetary requests (if any).  Winter Term courses should include recommendations concerning academic distribution and cultures and civilization distribution requirements.</p>\n<p>c. The same grading system applies to all students taking a particular course for credit. Winter Term courses are graded on an A-F basis unless special arrangements are made through the Curriculum Committee (e.g., occasional independent projects or other courses where the instructor decides that the special nature of the course is better suited to honors/pass/fail grading). Exceptions are internships and student-led courses, which are graded credit/no credit. All winter term course work must be completed by the end of the winter term. Grades of incomplete will be submitted according to existing procedures, and such work must be satisfactorily completed by the last day of classes of the following spring term.</p>\n<p><strong>2.  Winter Term Course Structure and General Procedures</strong></p>\n<p>a. Departments are encouraged to designate winter term courses as acceptable for credit toward majors and minors. Unless an exception is granted by the Curriculum Committee, enrollment will normally be limited to 22 students per instructor in any winter term course, 38 for a team-taught course, and 18 for language courses (per instructor). The enrollment limit for a winter term course that satisfies the College Writing requirement will be 12 students.</p>\n<p>b. All members of the faculty not on leave or released time are expected to contribute regularly to the winter term curriculum. During winter term, faculty and students are involved in only one academic credit bearing course, providing unique opportunities for study. Among these are extensive field work, independent study, internships, senior work, and interdisciplinary study. A minimum of eight contact hours per week is required for all winter term courses.</p>\n<p>c. A minimum of two and a maximum of four winter term courses will count toward the graduation requirement.  Winter term courses may be integrated with fall or spring semester course sequences. A fall semester course may be a prerequisite for a winter term course, or a winter term course may be a prerequisite for a spring semester course.</p>\n<p>d. A department normally may require its students to take no more than one of its winter term courses, in addition to winter term senior work, during four years. Students are urged to take winter term courses in substantially different academic areas in their first and second years. Over four years a student may take no more than three winter term courses in one department, and no more than two winter term courses, in addition to winter term senior work, in his or her major department. A student may take up to four interdepartmental winter term courses during these four years.</p>\n<p>e. Upper class students with sufficient credits may elect not to participate in winter term, but no student may remain on campus during winter term unless he or she is enrolled in a winter term course, credit-bearing independent project, on-campus internship, or off-campus internship in the local community.</p>\n<p>f. Students who fail winter term courses or independent winter projects will be placed on probation and required to make up a course credit.</p>\n<p>Theses, honors projects, and other work undertaken or completed during winter term as part of a larger project will be graded under the regular grading system; the grade to be based upon an evaluation of the project as a whole.</p>\n<p>g. Winter term course registration:</p>\n<p>i. A student must be in residence and enroll in a regular winter term course during his or her first winter term. This includes both September and February matriculates.</p>\n<p>ii. Students complete their registration during the registration period in early November. Students who are not on campus during the fall semester may register for winter term online in BannerWeb during the online winter term registration period.</p>\n<p>iii. Changes in course registration may be made only during the first three days on which classes meet during winter term. Due to time constraints during winter term, late adds are automatically charged a late fee of $50.</p>\n<p>iv. A student who misses the first class of winter term must be excused by a Commons dean or it will be assumed that the student has dropped the course.</p>\n<p>v. The registration windows for winter term open as follows: (1) students with 8-16.99 credits earned; (2) students with 3-7.99 credits earned; (3) students with 17-36+ credits earned.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Student Options for Winter Term</strong></p>\n<p>Students are required to earn Middlebury credits during two winter terms. All first-year students must enroll in a winter term course on the Middlebury campus. This includes both September and February matriculates. The second credit may be earned by enrolling in a winter term course, a credit-bearing independent project, a credit-bearing internship, or by studying abroad and earning winter term equivalent credit. (A minimum of two and a maximum of four winter term courses will count toward the graduation requirement of 36 course credits.)</p>\n<p><em>a. Independent Projects (0500 Work)</em></p>\n<p>Students with 8 or more credits may submit a proposal to their faculty sponsor for on or off-campus winter term independent work either as a continuation of their major or minor or as work outside of their major or minor as long as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>They have not completed more than two units of winter term independent work; and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They have received the approval of the chair or director of the department or program in which the work will be completed</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Students are not allowed to pursue independent projects during their first winter term.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>How to Apply</em></strong>: Contact a faculty member in the department/program in which the work will be done to ask if they will advise the project; once approved by the faculty member, the student should register for that faculty member's independent project section during the registration period (or by add card after the registration period has ended).<br>\n<strong><em>Deadline:</em> Ongoing until the Add Deadline</strong></p>\n<p><em>b. Winter Term Internships</em></p>\n<p>Winter term internships involve significant high-level exposure to the fundamental work of an organization, with ties to a student's academic and/or professional interests. They challenge students to apply their liberal arts learning in a real-world setting, and provide students with an opportunity to reflect meaningfully on the connections between their classroom learning and their outside-the-classroom experiences. Internships can be pursued during winter term and students can apply for the opportunity to earn academic credit for their work in reflecting upon, and making meaning of, the internship experience. The Curriculum Committee oversees this process, in partnership with individual faculty members and with the Center for Careers &#x26; Internships (CCI). To apply, students identify an internship opportunity and a faculty member whom they wish to advise them in connection with the internship. If the faculty member agrees that the internship provides a worthwhile opportunity for the application of liberal arts learning, the student and faculty member together develop a plan for the academic work that will express the student’s thoughtful reflection on the internship and its connections to their learning. The student then submits the faculty member’s approval and supporting documentation to the Center for Careers &#x26; Internships (CCI), as detailed on the <span>CCI website</span>. Students in these approved winter term internships spend a minimum of 25 hours per week (or 100 hours total) at their internship site, and complete the agreed upon academic work. At the end of the internship, the student, the faculty member, and the on-site work supervisor submit evaluation reports. The faculty member grades the student’s work in response to the internship on a Credit/No Credit basis. Students with fewer than 8 credits may not undertake winter term internships for credit, and students who take more than one internship in four years should pursue them in substantially different fields. A student may not repeat the same winter term internship for credit. A relative may not function as an internship supervisor. If the internship is in a non-English speaking-country, the committee will expect competence in the language of that country, although exceptions apply. Students can also pursue internships during winter term without receiving academic credit. More information about internship opportunities and the application process for winter term internship credit is available from CCI in Adirondack House (visit the internship pages on the CCI web site at <span>go/internships</span> or contact Cheryl Whitney Lower, ext. 5798).

Transfer Courses and Off-Campus Study","body":"\nAt Middlebury's discretion, students may earn academic credit through the following categories of off-campus study: transfer courses, 0555 courses, study abroad, pre-professional combined plans, domestic off-campus programs, and exchange programs. Each category of off-campus study is subject to separate rules, procedures, and financial aid implication, as indicated below. In cases of uncertainty as to the category of a student's off-campus study, a final determination will be made by the dean of curriculum or vice president for academic affairs and dean of the schools.\n\n**1\\. Transfer Courses**\n\nTransfer courses are those taken individually on an *ad hoc* basis (i.e., not as part of a domestic off-campus program, pre-professional combined plan, study abroad, or exchange program) from another institution of higher education.  To take such courses during the academic year, regularly enrolled students must normally withdraw temporarily from Middlebury and apply directly to the institution at which they wish to take a course or courses. International students should consult with International Student and Scholar Services, as there may be visa implications for temporarily withdrawing from Middlebury.\n\nStudents may transfer course credits from other institutions of higher education only at the discretion of Middlebury College. Students should obtain preliminary approval for any course for which they expect transfer credit before enrolling in it.  To apply for pre-approval to take courses at another college or university, students should complete in advance a [Transfer Credit Application Form](https://www.middlebury.edu/system/files/transfer_credit_form_july_2018_0.pdf), requiring approval by both the appropriate department chair or program director, whose responsibility is to evaluate the transfer course content and determine whether the tranfer course fulfills any degree requirements (i.e., academic distribution, cultures and civilizations, departmental major, etc.), and the dean of curriculum, who ensures that the transfer institution, the course credit value, and other course details adhere to Middlebury College's transfer credit guidelines. The form should be accompanied by a complete course description and a syllabus, if available; further information about the institution may also be required by the chair or dean. For summer transfer courses taken abroad, students must also complete the online [summer study abroad application form](https://studyabroad.middlebury.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgram&Program_ID=10376). Transcripts from approved educational institutions must be official and sent directly to the Registrar's Office at Middlebury from the institution that granted credit. Grade reports, unofficial transcripts, faxed or hand-carried transcripts are not acceptable.\n\nTo receive credit the transfer course should carry at least three semester-hour credits or five quarter-hour credits. Only courses that meet for a period of four weeks or longer and at least the same number of class hours as an equivalent Middlebury College course are eligible to receive credit. A student may only transfer two courses per summer session and a maximum of four summer courses over two sessions. Likewise, a student may only transfer a maximum of one course per Winter Term session. Only courses with a grade of C- or better may be transferred from another institution toward the Middlebury degree.  Courses graded on a pass/fail basis do not transfer. Transfer credits may be used to satisfy the academic and cultures/civilizations distribution requirements if the transfer credit is considered by the appropriate Middlebury department to be the equivalent of a Middlebury course that would satisfy one or more of those requirements. After students matriculate at Middlebury College, they normally may not take two-year or community college courses for credit towards a Middlebury degree.  College courses taken in high school and applied toward a high school diploma or in a college/high school cooperative program are not transferable. Only courses taken on college campuses, taught by college professors, for college students, and for which there are official transcripts may be considered for transfer.\n\nTransfer work from other institutions will be evaluated on a course-by-course basis to determine the fulfillment of Middlebury departmental and College requirements. All transfer courses completed off campus, whether in the U.S. or abroad, must receive final approval by the dean of curriculum. When courses are taken prior to matriculation at Middlebury, during summers, or while withdrawn from the College are transferred, the credit is recorded but not the grade that was awarded. Students on a post-matriculation semester or year-long study abroad program are not completing transfer courses, but rather a study abroad program (see below). Such students must have the program approved by the Programs Abroad Committee prior to their study abroad to receive Middlebury credit. Students will not receive transfer credit for non-approved study abroad programs.\n\nNeither federal financial aid nor Middlebury financial aid may be used in support of transfer courses. Questions about financial aid for transfer courses should be directed to the Office of Student Financial Services.\n\n**2\\. 0555 Courses**\n\nStudents may receive one course credit for highly specialized advanced work (designated 0555) relating to their major field with prior approval and subsequent evaluation by their major department. This work will normally be unpaid, done in the summer or when a student is not regularly enrolled, and will be graded credit/no credit.\n\nThe 0555 courses are not summer 0500 projects; they involve high-level research under professional supervision. Research must result in material that can be evaluated by a Middlebury faculty member. All 0555 projects must be approved in advance by the Curriculum Committee. A fee of $100 is charged for 0555 courses.\n\nNeither federal financial aid nor Middlebury financial aid may be used in support of 0555 courses. Questions about financial aid for transfer courses should be directed to the Office of Student Financial Services.\n\n**3.  Study Abroad**\n\nStudy abroad provides students opportunities to further develop their language skills and to study the culture of another country; or it can give access to academic programs, cultural resources, or natural environments unavailable at Middlebury College. More than half of each Middlebury class studies abroad in the junior year, many at the Middlebury C.V. Starr Schools Abroad, and some 65 percent of these students take courses in their discipline in the language of the host country and/or engage in advanced language study. To ensure a sense of purpose, students should clearly define academic and personal goals, possess adequate competence in language and other pertinent skills, and select an appropriate school and setting. Students who plan to study abroad, whether as part of a language, International and Global Studies, or other major, should consider beginning or continuing language study in their first semester at Middlebury.\n\nStudents wishing to study abroad should consult with their academic advisor, the appropriate language department and International Programs and Off-Campus Study.\n\nStudents who apply to one of the Middlebury C.V. Starr Schools Abroad have their applications evaluated internally by the International Programs and Off-Campus Study office. The Programs Abroad committee considers student applications for direct enrollment in selected overseas universities that are not affiliated with the Middlebury C.V. Starr Schools Abroad, and the committee also considers applications for certain study abroad programs established by other program providers and American colleges and universities. In granting permission for a study abroad program, Middlebury agrees to grant full equivalent credit on successful completion of the program, provided the student adheres to the policies outlined in Middlebury's Study Abroad Guidelines. Interested students should consult with International Programs and Off-Campus Study for further information.\n\nStudents studying on approved study abroad programs are charged an administrative fee. See the College Handbook Student Finances section for the fee for the current year. The purpose of the fee is to help offset administrative costs associated with study abroad, including advising, application to and approval by International Programs and Off-Campus Study or the Programs Abroad committee, assistance with registration and room draw while abroad, coordination with and oversight of study abroad programs, and awarding of credit.\n\nStudents approved for study abroad must maintain a satisfactory academic average. Should they not remain \"in good standing,\" permission may be rescinded.\n\nGrades for courses taken on approved programs abroad are recorded on the transcript and are included in the calculation of the grade point average. International Programs and Off-Campus Study is responsible for converting grades issued on other grading scales to the Middlebury A-F grading system.\n\nFor more information about study abroad requirements, students can check the guidelines posted on the [Study Abroad website](https://www.middlebury.edu/international/sa), as well as in the catalog entries for individual language departments, and/or they may consult International Programs and Off-Campus Study.\n\nFinancial aid is available for all Middlebury Schools Abroad programs and a small number of externally sponsored Middlebury approved programs. Students with questions about the availability of financial aid for specific programs are encouraged to consult the study abroad guidelines, International Programs and Off-Campus Study or the [Study Abroad website](https://www.middlebury.edu/international/sa) *(see above).* Questions about the process of applying for and receiving aid for approved programs can be answered by the staff in the Office of Student Financial Services.\n\n**4\\. Pre-Professional Combined Plans**\n\nMiddlebury College has agreements with several schools of engineering and nursing to offer pre-professional combined plans.  Pre-professional combined plans are those in which students enroll in approved professional school programs and become eligible for a Middlebury bachelor of arts degree upon receipt of a bachelor-level degree in the professional discipline, and completion of all Middlebury degree requirements. A student may propose and arrange a combined plan with another accredited professional school in medicine, dentistry, or veterinary medicine. Interested students should contact the chair of the pre-professional committee early in their college careers and no later than fall semester of the junior year. When credit is awarded for pre-approved pre-professional combined plans, both the credits awarded and all grades earned are included in the calculation of the cumulative grade point average on the Middlebury transcript. Further information is available at [Pre-professional Programs website](https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/options/preprof). Questions about financial aid for pre-professional combined plans should be directed to the Office of Student Financial Services.\n\n**5\\. Domestic Off-Campus Study Programs**\n\nDomestic off-campus study programs are full-time niche programs offered by other U.S. institutions of higher education, which the host institution has designed to focus on a particular academic subject area or theme and include a coherent and related set of courses. There are some regularly approved domestic off-campus programs (e.g., Washington Semester Program, SEA Education Association, Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program, Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory), but student are also permitted to apply for approval for alternative programs. Students should consult International Programs and Off-Campus Study for more information about these programs.\n\nStudents intending to enroll in a domestic off-campus study program must apply for approval and credit transfer through International Programs and Off-Campus Study. When credit is awarded for pre-approved domestic off-campus study programs, both the credits and the grades are recorded on the transcript, and the grades are included in the calculation of the grade point average.\n\nFederal sources of aid, but not Middlebury sources of aid, can be used in support of approved domestic off-campus study programs. Questions about the use of financial aid for these programs should be directed to the Office of Student Financial Services.\n\n**6\\. Domestic Exchange Programs**\n\nMiddlebury maintains exchange agreements with several U.S. institutions, which include reciprocal programs of study for outgoing Middlebury students and incoming students from partner exchange institutions. Middlebury maintains exchange programs with Spelman College, Swarthmore College and the Association of Vermont Independent Colleges (Bennington College, Champlain College, Goddard College, Marlboro College, Norwich University, Saint Michael's College, Southern Vermont College, and Sterling College). Interested students should contact International Programs and Off-Campus Study. When credit is awarded for domestic exchange programs, both the credits and the grades are recorded on the transcript, and the grades are included in the calculation of the grade point average.\n\nQuestions about the availability of financial aid for these programs should be directed to the Office of Student Financial Services.\n\n**7\\. Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC)**\n\nMiddlebury students who complete all eight of the ROTC courses at the University of Vermont are eligible to receive two credits towards their Middlebury College degree.  No credits will be awarded if the student does not complete the full sequence of ROTC courses. The two credits awarded will be general credits and will not satisfy any distribution requirements. Completion of the ROTC program will satisfy one of the two physical education units required for graduation.\n\n_rev. 8/16/17_\n","excerpt":"At Middlebury's discretion, students may earn academic credit through the following categories of off-campus study: transfer courses, 055…","html":"<p>At Middlebury's discretion, students may earn academic credit through the following categories of off-campus study: transfer courses, 0555 courses, study abroad, pre-professional combined plans, domestic off-campus programs, and exchange programs. Each category of off-campus study is subject to separate rules, procedures, and financial aid implication, as indicated below. In cases of uncertainty as to the category of a student's off-campus study, a final determination will be made by the dean of curriculum or vice president for academic affairs and dean of the schools.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Transfer Courses</strong></p>\n<p>Transfer courses are those taken individually on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis (i.e., not as part of a domestic off-campus program, pre-professional combined plan, study abroad, or exchange program) from another institution of higher education.  To take such courses during the academic year, regularly enrolled students must normally withdraw temporarily from Middlebury and apply directly to the institution at which they wish to take a course or courses. International students should consult with International Student and Scholar Services, as there may be visa implications for temporarily withdrawing from Middlebury.</p>\n<p>Students may transfer course credits from other institutions of higher education only at the discretion of Middlebury College. Students should obtain preliminary approval for any course for which they expect transfer credit before enrolling in it.  To apply for pre-approval to take courses at another college or university, students should complete in advance a <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/system/files/transfer_credit_form_july_2018_0.pdf\">Transfer Credit Application Form</a>, requiring approval by both the appropriate department chair or program director, whose responsibility is to evaluate the transfer course content and determine whether the tranfer course fulfills any degree requirements (i.e., academic distribution, cultures and civilizations, departmental major, etc.), and the dean of curriculum, who ensures that the transfer institution, the course credit value, and other course details adhere to Middlebury College's transfer credit guidelines. The form should be accompanied by a complete course description and a syllabus, if available; further information about the institution may also be required by the chair or dean. For summer transfer courses taken abroad, students must also complete the online <a href=\"https://studyabroad.middlebury.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgram&#x26;Program_ID=10376\">summer study abroad application form</a>. Transcripts from approved educational institutions must be official and sent directly to the Registrar's Office at Middlebury from the institution that granted credit. Grade reports, unofficial transcripts, faxed or hand-carried transcripts are not acceptable.</p>\n<p>To receive credit the transfer course should carry at least three semester-hour credits or five quarter-hour credits. Only courses that meet for a period of four weeks or longer and at least the same number of class hours as an equivalent Middlebury College course are eligible to receive credit. A student may only transfer two courses per summer session and a maximum of four summer courses over two sessions. Likewise, a student may only transfer a maximum of one course per Winter Term session. Only courses with a grade of C- or better may be transferred from another institution toward the Middlebury degree.  Courses graded on a pass/fail basis do not transfer. Transfer credits may be used to satisfy the academic and cultures/civilizations distribution requirements if the transfer credit is considered by the appropriate Middlebury department to be the equivalent of a Middlebury course that would satisfy one or more of those requirements. After students matriculate at Middlebury College, they normally may not take two-year or community college courses for credit towards a Middlebury degree.  College courses taken in high school and applied toward a high school diploma or in a college/high school cooperative program are not transferable. Only courses taken on college campuses, taught by college professors, for college students, and for which there are official transcripts may be considered for transfer.</p>\n<p>Transfer work from other institutions will be evaluated on a course-by-course basis to determine the fulfillment of Middlebury departmental and College requirements. All transfer courses completed off campus, whether in the U.S. or abroad, must receive final approval by the dean of curriculum. When courses are taken prior to matriculation at Middlebury, during summers, or while withdrawn from the College are transferred, the credit is recorded but not the grade that was awarded. Students on a post-matriculation semester or year-long study abroad program are not completing transfer courses, but rather a study abroad program (see below). Such students must have the program approved by the Programs Abroad Committee prior to their study abroad to receive Middlebury credit. Students will not receive transfer credit for non-approved study abroad programs.</p>\n<p>Neither federal financial aid nor Middlebury financial aid may be used in support of transfer courses. Questions about financial aid for transfer courses should be directed to the Office of Student Financial Services.</p>\n<p><strong>2. 0555 Courses</strong></p>\n<p>Students may receive one course credit for highly specialized advanced work (designated 0555) relating to their major field with prior approval and subsequent evaluation by their major department. This work will normally be unpaid, done in the summer or when a student is not regularly enrolled, and will be graded credit/no credit.</p>\n<p>The 0555 courses are not summer 0500 projects; they involve high-level research under professional supervision. Research must result in material that can be evaluated by a Middlebury faculty member. All 0555 projects must be approved in advance by the Curriculum Committee. A fee of $100 is charged for 0555 courses.</p>\n<p>Neither federal financial aid nor Middlebury financial aid may be used in support of 0555 courses. Questions about financial aid for transfer courses should be directed to the Office of Student Financial Services.</p>\n<p><strong>3.  Study Abroad</strong></p>\n<p>Study abroad provides students opportunities to further develop their language skills and to study the culture of another country; or it can give access to academic programs, cultural resources, or natural environments unavailable at Middlebury College. More than half of each Middlebury class studies abroad in the junior year, many at the Middlebury C.V. Starr Schools Abroad, and some 65 percent of these students take courses in their discipline in the language of the host country and/or engage in advanced language study. To ensure a sense of purpose, students should clearly define academic and personal goals, possess adequate competence in language and other pertinent skills, and select an appropriate school and setting. Students who plan to study abroad, whether as part of a language, International and Global Studies, or other major, should consider beginning or continuing language study in their first semester at Middlebury.</p>\n<p>Students wishing to study abroad should consult with their academic advisor, the appropriate language department and International Programs and Off-Campus Study.</p>\n<p>Students who apply to one of the Middlebury C.V.

The Handbook policies are intended to be read broadly and are not designed to define misconduct in exhaustive terms. Depending on their nature and severity, policy violations may be adjudicated and discipline may be assigned by several different administrators and judicial boards, as detailed in the Student Life policies in this Handbook section. The deans, administrators and judicial boards consider the totality of a student’s history, the impact on community, and the specific circumstances of the event when determining appropriate responses to policy violations. Consistent with the cultivation of an awareness of responsibility and accountability as a member of a larger community, students found in violation of Middlebury policies and/or participating in prohibited acts will be held responsible, subject to discipline, and/or charged for costs associated with their behavior, as described further within this Handbook.\n\n### <a name=\"community-standards\" id=\"community-standards\"></a>i. Community Standards\n\nThe ability of Middlebury to achieve its purposes depends on members of the campus community upholding our commonly accepted standards of conduct, which enable the highest quality of teaching and learning.  Broadly, these are referred to as our Community Standards.  Middlebury seeks to prepare students to be active citizens and leaders who will address the world’s most pressing problems. This mission is advanced through students’ experiences with successes and challenges, and is reflected in the following Community Standards:\n\n- cultivating respect and responsibility for self, others, and our shared environment;\n- encouraging personal and intellectual courage and growth;\n- manifesting integrity and honesty in all decisions and actions;\n- promoting healthy, safe and balanced lifestyles;\n- fostering a diverse and inclusive community committed to civility, open-mindedness and finding common ground.\n\nTherefore, a balance of individual and community health and growth guides Middlebury’s approach to all endeavors, and to the policies that support those endeavors.\n\n### ii. Non-discrimination Statement\n\nAs described in the Middlebury-Wide Policies, the College complies with applicable provisions of state and federal law which prohibit discrimination in employment, or in admission or access to its educational or extracurricular programs, activities, or facilities, on the basis of race, creed, color, place of birth, ancestry, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, service in the armed forces of the United States, positive HIV-related blood test results, genetic information, or against qualified individuals with disabilities on the basis of disability and/or any other status or characteristic as defined and to the extent protected by applicable law. Middlebury also complies with all other anti-discrimination protections that might be provided by particular states in which it operates educational programs; questions about the scope of any such protections should be addressed to the [Compliance Officer/Title IX Coordinator](https://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/hro) and/or the on-site administrative representative for the particular program at issue. The Compliance Officer/Title IX Coordinator coordinates Middlebury's efforts to comply with any and all federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of one or more of the protected characteristics listed above. Discrimination complaints are processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Middlebury's [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin).  Complaints about sexual misconduct, dating violence, stalking , etc. are handled in accordance with Middlebury’s Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking.  Information about the work of the Community Bias response Team is available here.\n\n### <a name=\"scope-of-oversight\" id=\"scope-of-oversight\"></a>iii. Scope of Oversight\n\nStudents will be held accountable for policy violations that take place between the time they first arrive on campus to begin their Middlebury program and their graduation or official program completion, or Middlebury’s  confirmation of their resignation or expulsion. Conduct that takes place on or near Middlebury premises or property; occurs at or in connection with a Middlebury-related event; or occurs off-campus but may represent a threat to the safety of the Middlebury community or its members, the pursuit of its objectives, and/or the educational environment of others, may be subject to Middlebury’s  disciplinary process. In cases where a student is found responsible for a policy violation while participating in any Middlebury or non-Middlebury program, the finding of responsibility may also be referred to the appropriate authority overseeing any additional Middlebury program in which the student is or will also be enrolled for other action as deemed appropriate. This may include but is not limited to: further investigation; additional adjudication under existing policies (using only information gathered in the first disciplinary process, or using subsequently gathered information, or both, as deemed appropriate by the overseeing authority); disciplinary action; or other remedies or processes deemed appropriate by the authority overseeing the additional Middlebury program.\n\nMiddlebury retains sole discretion to determine whether to initiate an investigation and adjudication under this policy regardless of the outcome of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by a non-Middlebury institution or program and/or the outcome of any law enforcement investigation or court proceeding.\n\n### <a name=\"pending-discipline\" id=\"pending-discipline\"></a>iv. Pending Discipline\n\nA student respondent will not be permitted to graduate from or otherwise be deemed to have officially completed a Middlebury program in which they are enrolled while a disciplinary matter is pending; the student’s graduation or certification will be held in abeyance until the matter is resolved. If a respondent withdraws with a disciplinary matter, sanction, or appeal pending, the withdrawal will be considered a resignation from Middlebury, and the student will have given up the opportunity to return to any Middlebury program. The student’s official status at Middlebury will reflect the point in the process at which they withdrew, and the nature of the finding and sanction, as appropriate. Examples include but are not limited to \"Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Matter Pending,\" \"Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Sanction Pending,\" and \"Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Appeal Pending.\"\n\nIn extraordinary circumstances, the appropriate supervisory authority may, after appropriate consultation, a review of the case, and consideration of Middlebury’s best interests, grant permission for a respondent to withdraw from Middlebury when a disciplinary matter is pending. If the student is readmitted to Middlebury, the disciplinary matter must be resolved either before the student's return, or immediately upon the student's return (as determined by Middlebury). See [Student Status](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/student-status) for more information. Middlebury may also notify all institutions or programs in which the student is (or will be) enrolled of any pending or unresolved disciplinary matter pertaining to that student.\n\n### v. Deadlines\n\nSeveral Student Life policies include deadlines. Unless otherwise noted, “days” indicates calendar days, regardless of whether the majority of Middlebury’s administrative offices are open. “Business days” indicates days on which the majority of Middlebury’s administrative offices are open, and generally connotes Mondays through Fridays. In computing any period of time referenced in this policy, the day of the act or event (e.g., notification of hearing, issuance of an outcome letter, etc.) from which the designated time period begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included if it is a business day; when not a business day, the period will conclude at the end of the next business day.\n\n</div>\n","excerpt":"The purpose of College policies and the disciplinary system in Middlebury’s academic community is to protect the well-being of the community…","html":"<div class=\"field-item even\">\n<p><span>The purpose of College policies and the disciplinary system in Middlebury’s academic community is to protect the well-being of the community and to advance our shared educational mission by establishing a range of appropriate behavior.

This may include but is not limited to: further investigation; additional adjudication under existing policies (using only information gathered in the first disciplinary process, or using subsequently gathered information, or both, as deemed appropriate by the overseeing authority); disciplinary action; or other remedies or processes deemed appropriate by the authority overseeing the additional Middlebury program.</p>\n<p>Middlebury retains sole discretion to determine whether to initiate an investigation and adjudication under this policy regardless of the outcome of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by a non-Middlebury institution or program and/or the outcome of any law enforcement investigation or court proceeding.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"pending-discipline\" id=\"pending-discipline\"></a>iv. Pending Discipline</h3>\n<p>A student respondent will not be permitted to graduate from or otherwise be deemed to have officially completed a Middlebury program in which they are enrolled while a disciplinary matter is pending; the student’s graduation or certification will be held in abeyance until the matter is resolved. If a respondent withdraws with a disciplinary matter, sanction, or appeal pending, the withdrawal will be considered a resignation from Middlebury, and the student will have given up the opportunity to return to any Middlebury program. The student’s official status at Middlebury will reflect the point in the process at which they withdrew, and the nature of the finding and sanction, as appropriate. Examples include but are not limited to \"Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Matter Pending,\" \"Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Sanction Pending,\" and \"Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Appeal Pending.\"</p>\n<p>In extraordinary circumstances, the appropriate supervisory authority may, after appropriate consultation, a review of the case, and consideration of Middlebury’s best interests, grant permission for a respondent to withdraw from Middlebury when a disciplinary matter is pending. If the student is readmitted to Middlebury, the disciplinary matter must be resolved either before the student's return, or immediately upon the student's return (as determined by Middlebury). See <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/student-status\">Student Status</a> for more information. Middlebury may also notify all institutions or programs in which the student is (or will be) enrolled of any pending or unresolved disciplinary matter pertaining to that student.</p>\n<h3>v. Deadlines</h3>\n<p>Several Student Life policies include deadlines. Unless otherwise noted, “days” indicates calendar days, regardless of whether the majority of Middlebury’s administrative offices are open. “Business days” indicates days on which the majority of Middlebury’s administrative offices are open, and generally connotes Mondays through Fridays. In computing any period of time referenced in this policy, the day of the act or event (e.g., notification of hearing, issuance of an outcome letter, etc.) from which the designated time period begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included if it is a business day; when not a business day, the period will conclude at the end of the next business day.</p>\n</div>"},"f8f5d7f9-a431-5ce3-9bf8-802d62171c33":{"id":"f8f5d7f9-a431-5ce3-9bf8-802d62171c33","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/residential-life-policies/apprv-furniture","title":"Approved Furniture","body":"\n1.

Sanctions","body":"\n<div class=\"field-item even\">\n\nWhen determining a sanction, the nature and severity of the violation and the impact to individuals or community will be taken into account as well as the disciplinary history of the student. While intent is not a factor in determining responsibility, it can be a factor in determining a sanction. A student’s compliance with the process may also be a factor in determining an appropriate sanction. Finally, balancing consistency by acknowledging precedent and equity by considering the impact of the sanction on the individual is a foundational tenet of sanctioning.\n\n**a.** Sanctions may only be imposed for the specific charge of which the student has been notified in writing.\n\n**b.** It is important to note that discipline is cumulative at Middlebury, and further infractions, for example, following the successful conclusion of a probationary period, may still result in more severe outcomes.\n\n**c.** <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Middlebury College Sanctions include</span> (but are not limited to):\n\n**i. Informal College discipline:** The following sanctions are informal College discipline and not part of the student’s permanent record. Students who receive these sanctions can answer negatively if they are asked if they have been subject to official College discipline. A record of the sanction remains in a student's file until graduation, when it is removed. These sanctions are taken into account in determining future disciplinary penalties and may serve to make further violations of Middlebury policies more serious.\n\n1.  **_Fines or restitution_**: Fines or restitution are commensurate with the nature of the offense. The monetary cost of the harm done may be taken into account in assessment of a fine or an order of restitution.  \n\n2.  **_Warnings_**: A verbal or written warning may be issued when a student has violated Middlebury College policy. A warning is intended to educate the student about community standards, Middlebury policies and/or state laws, and the need to adhere to them.  \n\n3.  **_Reprimands_**: A letter of reprimand may be issued when a student demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to abide by community standards by repeatedly violating Middlebury policy. A letter of reprimand may also be issued when a student has committed a violation of College policy that has had or may have had a negative impact on an individual or on the community, or has undermined Middlebury’s community standards. A reprimand registers strongly the College’s concern regarding the student’s actions and its firm expectations for immediate improved behavior.  Parents or guardians are informed when students are reprimanded.  \n\n4.  **_Probationary Status_**:  Students may be placed on probationary status when the number or nature of their Middlebury policy violation(s) is sufficiently concerning that an additional policy violation will most likely result in official College discipline (please see below).  Probationary status provides students with an opportunity to avoid this outcome. They may do so by demonstrating improved conduct, generally reflected in their sustained ability to respect community standards and adhere to College policies. If students commit new policy violations while on probation, an appropriate course of action will be determined. Considerations may include the gravity and impact of the new infraction; the student’s response during and following the new infraction; and the student’s progress during the probationary period. Parents or guardians are informed when students are placed on probationary status. \n\n**ii. Official College Discipline:**  Official College discipline is intended to encourage immediate improved behavior, and acceptance of responsibility and growth by establishing this incident on the student's permanent record. Students who receive official College discipline must answer affirmatively if they are asked whether they have been subject to discipline.  Parents or guardians are informed when students receive official College discipline.\n\n1.  **_Academic Probation_**:  Academic probation is a sanction for  academic integrity violations and extends for the rest of the student's College career.  A student found guilty of academic dishonesty while on academic probation will be suspended. Parents or guardians are informed when students are placed on disciplinary academic probation.  \n\n2.  **_Letter of Official College Discipline_**: Students may receive a letter of official College discipline when their actions have demonstrated disregard for Middlebury’s community standards and policies such that an additional infraction of College policy will most likely result in suspension from Middlebury.  \n\n3.  **_Suspension_**:  Suspension is issued when a student commits a serious policy violation, or repeatedly violates College policy, thereby demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to behave in a manner consistent with Middlebury’s community standards.  The behavior is sufficiently egregious that the student is required to leave the Middlebury community for a period of time. It is intended to encourage acceptance of responsibility and growth by establishing this incident on the student's permanent record; to provide the student with an opportunity to consider and address the problematic behavior; and to develop strategies to ensure that the student’s eventual return to Middlebury will be successful for the student and for the community.  \n\n    Suspension is ordinarily imposed for a minimum of a semester and a maximum of three semesters.  In determining the length of suspension, the Office of Community Standards will consider the student’s prior conduct history; the gravity of the violation and its impact on the community; and the need for sufficient time for the student to demonstrate that the concerning behavior has been satisfactorily addressed. When the Office of Community Standards feels that suspension for three semesters is insufficient to allow for a student’s successful return to the community, expulsion will be the normal outcome, barring exceptional circumstances.  \n\n    If a student has been found guilty of academic dishonesty and the suspension does not take effect until the end of the semester, no opportunity may be granted to make up or otherwise fulfill the requirements of the course in question, although the student may complete all other courses in which he or she is concurrently enrolled. In this case, the course grade will be recorded as an F.  A student suspended for academic dishonesty normally may not transfer to Middlebury course credits earned at other institutions during the period of suspension. However, this part of the sanction may be modified if compelling reasons warrant such action.  \n\n    Students who are suspended must apply for readmission through the Administration Committee, and must demonstrate readiness to return to Middlebury. Readiness to return is determined by a student’s adherence to the terms of the sanction and the deadlines of the readmission process; by the completion of any additional conditions that may have been established at the time of the student’s departure; and by the provision of satisfactory evidence that the problematic behavior will not recur. If a student is unable to demonstrate readiness to return at the stated conclusion of the period of suspension, the Administration Committee may deny readmission until it is satisfied that the conditions that led to the student’s departure have been appropriately addressed.  \n\n    Students who are suspended must leave campus; are restricted from all Middlebury owned or rented properties; and are prohibited from participating in all Middlebury activities or programs, from Middlebury employment, and from using Middlebury facilities during the stated period of the suspension. When suspension prohibits students from completing a semester they have already begun, the comprehensive fee for that semester is not refunded. Parents or guardians are informed when students are suspended. For international students, suspension may affect immigration status; related questions may be directed to the Office of International Student and Scholar Services.  \n\n4.  **_Expulsion_**:  For particularly serious offenses, students may be permanently dismissed from Middlebury. Please see Appeals Procedure below for more information.  In cases of expulsion from Middlebury, no refund of the comprehensive fee is made. Parents or guardians are informed when students are expelled.\n\n</div>","excerpt":"When determining a sanction, the nature and severity of the violation and the impact to individuals or community will be taken into account…","html":"<div class=\"field-item even\">\n<p>When determining a sanction, the nature and severity of the violation and the impact to individuals or community will be taken into account as well as the disciplinary history of the student.

Understanding Your Health Record/Information</span>\n\nEach time you visit Parton Center for Health and Wellness (Counseling, Health Services, and Sports Medicine), or when Parton has an interaction with a third party about you, the information is documented in a secured, password protected electronic health file that is accessible only to Parton Center for Health and Wellness staff. Typically, this record contains a summary of your presenting concerns and symptoms, physical exam and/or counseling intake, test results, diagnoses, counseling progress notes, treatment and plan for future course of treatment if appropriate. This information makes up your “health record” or personal health information, and serves as a:\n\n- Basis for planning your care and treatment;\n- Means of communication with other health professionals who contribute to your care;\n- Legal document describing the care you received;\n- Source of information for public health officials charged with protecting the health of this state and the nation (only under very restricted circumstances);\n- Tool with which we can assess and continually work to improve the care we render and the outcomes we achieve.\n\nYou are entitled to receive a copy of your health records, or we can prepare a summary for you. Because these are professional records, they may be best interpreted by someone who is a health professional. If you wish to see your records, we recommend you review them with us so that we can discuss the contents. In accordance with state law, Parton Center for Health and Wellness retains your records for a period of seven (7) years.  More information about your medical records can be found here.\n\n1.  <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Confidentiality</span>\n\nHealth records at Parton are confidential and are completely separate from all other College records. Students have the right to revoke or restrict authorization to share health care information, and Parton will not release any information about you without your written permission, except under the following conditions:\n\n- As authorized or required by law (i.e., when we are presented with a valid court order requiring us to release records);\n- As necessary to protect you or others from a serious threat to health and safety, or to protect property from a serious threat of damage;\n- As necessary to notify parents and/or deans when you have a serious mental or physical health problem and are unable to assume responsibility for notifying others.\n\nIn addition, Parton medical, sports medicine, and counseling staff confer with one another as needed to provide integrated care for you. Parton also works with Porter Hospital and the Counseling Service of Addison County (CSAC) to ensure a full range of medical and mental health options for students; when students receive treatment at multiple offices, we exchange only such information as is needed to maintain continuity of care.  Students may make requests to Parton, Porter or CSAC to revoke or restrict authorization to share such information.\n\nPlease note: Middlebury College and Parton Center for Health and Wellness are not subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and therefore are not required to comply with the various federal regulations relating to the use and disclosure of health information. Middlebury College is, however, committed to protecting student privacy. This policy should not be interpreted as creating any contractual rights and Middlebury College reserves the right to make changes to this policy at any time without prior notice.\n\n#### **3<a name=\"vaccines\" id=\"vaccines\"></a>.** **Vaccines**\n\nVermont law requires that all students submit an immunization record, including proof of:\n\n- Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR): two doses after the student's first birthday\n- Meningococcal vaccine\n- Hepatitis B vaccine series\n- Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular Pertussis (Tdap)\n- Varicella (chickenpox) vaccine: two dose series for people 13 and older who have not had chickenpox.\n\nSome students, including those who travel abroad will benefit from:\n\n- Hepatitis A vaccine series\n- Typhoid vaccine\n- Other travel vaccines depend on destination and can be determined at a travel visit at Parton.\n\nDue to the length of time some vaccine series require, we recommend that all students considering travel abroad also consider receiving the Hepatitis A vaccine series prior to matriculation.\n\n#### **<a name=\"pandemic\" id=\"pandemic\"></a>4\\.** **Pandemic Preparedness: Student Information Requirement**\n\n_All Middlebury College students are required to develop and enter a personal evacuation plan._\n\nMiddlebury College has expanded and updated its Emergency Plan to include the threat of severe illness, including pandemic flu. Because of the potential need for a quick response to an outbreak, individuals are the only people who can effectively plan for themselves. All Middlebury College students are required to develop and submit at least one Personal Evacuation Plan. Students will not be allowed to register for their second semester of classes until they have entered a plan (via Banner Web) that meets the minimum required elements.\n\n#### **5<a name=\"hiv\" id=\"hiv\"></a>.** **Middlebury College Policy on HIV Infection**\n\nThe Middlebury College policy on HIV infection was revised in 1992 by the HIV Task Force, composed of Middlebury College students, staff, and faculty. The revised policy expresses a commitment to prevention of the disease through education, outlines services available in the campus community to individuals living with HIV, and sets guidelines for dealing with HIV-related issues. Copies of the policy are available to students at Parton, the Commons offices and online on the Parton website.\n\n#### **6<a name=\"records\" id=\"records\"></a>. Records Retention Policy**\n\nParton Center for Health and Wellness, in order to establish guidelines for the maintenance, retention, preservation and disposal of medical records that are created or maintained by it, hereby adopts the following policy for preserving those records.\n\n**Policy**\n\nIt is the policy of Parton Center for Health and Wellness:\n\n(1)  to retain medical records for the period of time required by applicable law and regulation as indicated in these guidelines;\n\n(2)  to dispose of medical records promptly, in the appropriate manner after they have satisfied their required retention period, unless they are the subject of a Litigation Hold;\n\n(3)  to preserve medical records subject to a Litigation Hold, if the records would otherwise be disposed of.\n\n**Retention Guidelines**\n\nMedical records are to be retained for the time periods indicated as follows.  The medical records may be maintained in paper or electronic format, as appropriate and may be stored on-site or off-site, in accordance with the need to access the records.  The creator or receiver of the medical records is responsible for retaining the record.\n\nSome records are not subject to any retention period and can be discarded when they do not have administrative value.  Other documents are not considered “records” within the meaning of this policy and need to be maintained only as long they have administrative value.  Documents that are not considered “records” include:  duplicate copies of correspondence or other documents, blank forms, and transitory messages used for informal communication of information only, such as voice mails, self-sticking notes and phone messages.  Documents that are not “records” may be discarded when they do not have administrative value.\n\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"354\">\n\nRECORDS\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"234\">\n\nRETENTION PERIOD\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"354\">\n\nMedical records - Adults (over 18)\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"234\">\n\n7 years from last date of treatment (graduation)\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"354\">\n\nMedical records – Minors (under 18)\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"234\">\n\nThe longer of 7 years from date of treatment or until the patient is 25\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n**Disposal Guidelines**\n\nRecords should be disposed of promptly if they do not need to be retained in accordance with these guidelines.  It is costly to manage and store records and the intention of these guidelines is to manage this process while meeting Parton Center for Health and Wellness’s legal obligations.  Records must be disposed of in a manner that safeguards confidential, sensitive or proprietary information contained in the records.\n\n**Litigation Hold Guidelines**\n\nThe Executive Director shall be notified immediately if an employee receives notification of any claim or complaint that could lead to litigation or governmental investigation.  The Executive Director will evaluate the information and communicate with the appropriate employees to assure that all evidence and records relating to the matter are preserved until the litigation or investigation is complete.   No employee should discard any document subject to a Litigation Hold.\n","excerpt":"Health Forms Commitment to Confidentiality Vaccines Pandemic Preparedness: Student Information Requirement Middlebury College Policy on HIV…","html":"<p><strong><a href=\"#health\">Health Forms</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"#confidentiality\">Commitment to Confidentiality</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"#vaccines\">Vaccines</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"#pandemic\">Pandemic Preparedness: Student Information Requiremen</a><a href=\"/pages/student_policies/student_health#pandemic\">t</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"#hiv\">Middlebury College Policy on HIV Infection</a></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"#records\"><strong>Records Retention Policy</strong></a></p>\n<h3 style=\"color:#660000\"><strong>Parton Center for Health and Wellness</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/services/healthctr\">Parton Center for Health and Wellness </a>(\"Parton\") promotes student well-being.

Forms are due:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>July 1 for September matriculation</li>\n<li>October 31 for February matriculation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>2<a name=\"confidentiality\" id=\"confidentiality\"></a>.</strong> <strong>Commitment to Confidentiality</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">a. Understanding Your Health Record/Information</span></p>\n<p>Each time you visit Parton Center for Health and Wellness (Counseling, Health Services, and Sports Medicine), or when Parton has an interaction with a third party about you, the information is documented in a secured, password protected electronic health file that is accessible only to Parton Center for Health and Wellness staff. Typically, this record contains a summary of your presenting concerns and symptoms, physical exam and/or counseling intake, test results, diagnoses, counseling progress notes, treatment and plan for future course of treatment if appropriate. This information makes up your “health record” or personal health information, and serves as a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basis for planning your care and treatment;</li>\n<li>Means of communication with other health professionals who contribute to your care;</li>\n<li>Legal document describing the care you received;</li>\n<li>Source of information for public health officials charged with protecting the health of this state and the nation (only under very restricted circumstances);</li>\n<li>Tool with which we can assess and continually work to improve the care we render and the outcomes we achieve.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You are entitled to receive a copy of your health records, or we can prepare a summary for you. Because these are professional records, they may be best interpreted by someone who is a health professional. If you wish to see your records, we recommend you review them with us so that we can discuss the contents. In accordance with state law, Parton Center for Health and Wellness retains your records for a period of seven (7) years.  More information about your medical records can be found here.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Confidentiality</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Health records at Parton are confidential and are completely separate from all other College records. Students have the right to revoke or restrict authorization to share health care information, and Parton will not release any information about you without your written permission, except under the following conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As authorized or required by law (i.e., when we are presented with a valid court order requiring us to release records);</li>\n<li>As necessary to protect you or others from a serious threat to health and safety, or to protect property from a serious threat of damage;</li>\n<li>As necessary to notify parents and/or deans when you have a serious mental or physical health problem and are unable to assume responsibility for notifying others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, Parton medical, sports medicine, and counseling staff confer with one another as needed to provide integrated care for you. Parton also works with Porter Hospital and the Counseling Service of Addison County (CSAC) to ensure a full range of medical and mental health options for students; when students receive treatment at multiple offices, we exchange only such information as is needed to maintain continuity of care.  Students may make requests to Parton, Porter or CSAC to revoke or restrict authorization to share such information.</p>\n<p>Please note: Middlebury College and Parton Center for Health and Wellness are not subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and therefore are not required to comply with the various federal regulations relating to the use and disclosure of health information. Middlebury College is, however, committed to protecting student privacy. This policy should not be interpreted as creating any contractual rights and Middlebury College reserves the right to make changes to this policy at any time without prior notice.</p>\n<h4><strong>3<a name=\"vaccines\" id=\"vaccines\"></a>.</strong> <strong>Vaccines</strong></h4>\n<p>Vermont law requires that all students submit an immunization record, including proof of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR): two doses after the student's first birthday</li>\n<li>Meningococcal vaccine</li>\n<li>Hepatitis B vaccine series</li>\n<li>Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular Pertussis (Tdap)</li>\n<li>Varicella (chickenpox) vaccine: two dose series for people 13 and older who have not had chickenpox.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some students, including those who travel abroad will benefit from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hepatitis A vaccine series</li>\n<li>Typhoid vaccine</li>\n<li>Other travel vaccines depend on destination and can be determined at a travel visit at Parton.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to the length of time some vaccine series require, we recommend that all students considering travel abroad also consider receiving the Hepatitis A vaccine series prior to matriculation.</p>\n<h4><strong><a name=\"pandemic\" id=\"pandemic\"></a>4.</strong> <strong>Pandemic Preparedness: Student Information Requirement</strong></h4>\n<p><em>All Middlebury College students are required to develop and enter a personal evacuation plan.</em></p>\n<p>Middlebury College has expanded and updated its Emergency Plan to include the threat of severe illness, including pandemic flu. Because of the potential need for a quick response to an outbreak, individuals are the only people who can effectively plan for themselves. All Middlebury College students are required to develop and submit at least one Personal Evacuation Plan. Students will not be allowed to register for their second semester of classes until they have entered a plan (via Banner Web) that meets the minimum required elements.</p>\n<h4><strong>5<a name=\"hiv\" id=\"hiv\"></a>.</strong> <strong>Middlebury College Policy on HIV Infection</strong></h4>\n<p>The Middlebury College policy on HIV infection was revised in 1992 by the HIV Task Force, composed of Middlebury College students, staff, and faculty. The revised policy expresses a commitment to prevention of the disease through education, outlines services available in the campus community to individuals living with HIV, and sets guidelines for dealing with HIV-related issues. Copies of the policy are available to students at Parton, the Commons offices and online on the Parton website.</p>\n<h4><strong>6<a name=\"records\" id=\"records\"></a>.

Introduction to Middlebury Student Discipline Processes\n\n### <a name=\"overview\" id=\"overview\"></a>a. Overview\n\nMiddlebury strives to balance individual growth with community health and growth, through our shared [Community Standards](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/a-introductory-matters), [Middlebury-Wide Policies](/pages/i-policies-for-all), [General Conduct Standards](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/genl-cond-standards) for students, and the student discipline procedures that enforce general conduct expectations. Our discipline processes are intended to be educational, first and foremost. Where other Middlebury policies specify separate procedures, those procedures will apply.\n\nThe Office of Community Standards and the Judicial Board’s enforcement of Middlebury policies is under the oversight of the Vice-President for Student Affairs and the Dean of Students.  The VPSA/DOS is responsible for consulting with the Vice-President of Academic Affairs/Dean of the Faculty in regards to academic honesty and integrity, and other student conduct expectations.  The VPSA/DOS is responsible for establishing appropriate investigation, adjudication, and appeal procedures for the Judicial Board.  These procedures are published in the Middlebury Handbook.  Suggested revisions may be submitted to the Office of Community Standards, and/or the VPSA at any time, although revisions are ordinarily implemented during the summer.  The Office of Community Standards will make available to the faculty a report about Judicial Board matters in the aggregate, without personally identifiable information, on an annual basis.\n\nConcerns about student behavior should be shared with the Office of Community Standards as a starting point, although the Office may refer specific behaviors to other processes, for example the TIX Sexual Harassment Investigations & Resolutions Procedure.   The Office of Community Standards administers the disciplinary procedures for both academic conduct, and student life conduct.  Concerns about academic integrity as well as non-academic student behavior should first directed to the Office of Community Standards, unless they involve discrimination, in which case they should be directed first to the Civil Rights/Title IX Coordinator.\n\nConduct matters may be resolved in several ways.  Restorative justice may be available for both academic and non-academic issues.  Conduct issues where the relevant facts are not in dispute will ordinarily be resolved by the assignment of a sanction from the Office of Community Standards.  If a student is assigned a sanction of official college discipline, they may appeal that sanction to the appropriate Vice-President or Dean.  For conduct issues where the facts are disputed, a hearing will be held before the Judicial Board.  The Board will determine the facts and make a recommendation regarding sanction to the Office of Community Standards.  Procedures for Judicial Board hearings are outlined below.\n\n# <a name=\"prelimissues\" id=\"prelimissues\"></a>II. Preliminary Issues\n\n### <a name=\"applicability\" id=\"applicability\"></a>a. Applicability of These Procedures\n\nAs described in [Section B.2.a.iii, Scope of Oversight](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/a-introductory-matters), students will be held accountable for policy violations that take place between the time they first arrive on campus to begin their Middlebury program and their graduation, or the College's confirmation of their withdrawal or resignation.  As described in [Section B.2.a.iv, Pending Discipline](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/a-introductory-matters), a student respondent will not be permitted to graduate from or otherwise be deemed to have officially completed a Middlebury program in which they are enrolled while a disciplinary matter is pending.\n\n### <a name=\"adminresolution\" id=\"adminresolution\"></a>b. Administrative resolution\n\nIn certain circumstances, the Office of Community Standards (or the Vice President for Student Affairs/DOS) has discretion to charge an appropriate Middlebury Vice President/Dean, such as the Vice President for Academic Affairs/Dean of the Faculty, to adjudicate a matter. Such circumstances may include adjudicating a matter with compelling privacy interests, such as a case of sexual exploitation, or an alleged violation of an active NCO after the conclusion of an SMDVS investigation, or adjudicating an alleged academic conduct violation during the summer when there are compelling circumstances, etc. While the adjudication process will be tailored to the particular circumstances of the matter, it will adhere to the principle of fundamental fairness for the parties involved. In these cases, the Office of Community Standards or Vice President for Student Affairs may also adjust the sanctioning and appellate authority as necessary.\n\n### <a name=\"NCO\" id=\"NCO\"></a>c. No Contact Orders\n\nWhen a verbal or physical altercation, sexual misconduct, stalking, harassment, discrimination, retaliation, or hazing has been alleged, or when otherwise deemed appropriate under the circumstances, the VPSA, dean of students, deans, Human Relations Officers, Civil Rights/Title IX coordinator, and members of the Public Safety staff have the authority to issue No Contact Orders to the persons involved, whether or not disciplinary action is taken. A No Contact Order is used to restrict encounters between individuals. While a No Contact Order is not a disciplinary sanction, and will not appear on a student’s disciplinary record, refusal to adhere to the order after written or verbal notification of its terms is prohibited and may result in disciplinary action.\n\n### <a name=\"legalproceedings\" id=\"legalproceedings\"></a>d. Legal Proceedings and Legal Counsel\n\nMiddlebury College disciplinary action is distinct from and not dependent upon the outcome of any legal proceedings involving a student, although conduct that forms the basis for legal proceedings may also warrant disciplinary action by Middlebury, and conviction of a crime may in itself justify disciplinary action.\n\nIndividual students may pursue criminal or civil legal action, or be required to respond to it.  While students are enrolled in any Middlebury program, they must inform Middlebury if they are charged with a felony by state or federal authorities. Failure to do so may itself result in disciplinary action.\n\nMiddlebury endeavors to provide general supports to students involved in personal legal proceedings but has no role to play in such actions, and may not interfere in them.   Middlebury officials and other students may, like all persons, be compelled to give testimony or evidence if subject to the subpoena power of a court.\n\n### <a name=\"cooperation\" id=\"cooperation\"></a>e. Cooperation and Honesty\n\nConsistent with Middlebury’s core requirement of honesty and cooperation, students are expected to cooperate in all disciplinary proceedings, be honest and straightforward in their participation, and provide accurate information.  The provision of false or misleading information to the Office of Community Standards or the Judicial Board may itself be grounds for disciplinary action.  Deliberate violations of this provision are considered serious offenses.\n\n### <a name=\"fairness\" id=\"fairness\"></a>f. Principles of Fundamental Fairness\n\nMiddlebury’s discipline procedures are driven by our commitment to fundamental fairness.  Among the considerations weighed by the Vice President for Student Affairs in establishing these procedures are: (1) ensuring that Middlebury’s conduct expectations are reasonable, (2) ensuring that students have reasonable notice (they know or should have known) about the conduct expectations, (3) providing that disciplinary procedures are carried out by individuals who are properly trained and authorized to act, (4) utilizing procedures that result in outcomes based on meaningful evidence, and (5) ensuring that students have notice of the charges against them, as well as an opportunity to present evidence, and (6) providing for appeals in processes that result in a sanction of official College discipline.\n\nColleges are not courts of law, and Middlebury’s disciplinary proceedings have as their fundamental goal _education_, rather than criminal punishment or compensation.  Middlebury does not have the power to subpoena evidence or place witnesses under oath, and procedures are therefore necessarily different from a civil or criminal legal proceeding. However, the procedures outlined below and in the [TIX Sexual Harassment Investigations and Resolutions Procedure](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-b-1-title-ix-investigation-resolutions-policy), as well as the [Non-Discrimination Investigations and Resolutions Procedure](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin), are designed to provide fundamental fairness and to protect students from arbitrary or capricious disciplinary action. All disciplinary authorities of Middlebury, including judicial board members, deans and Human Relations Officers conduct their proceedings in the spirit of these principles. If exceptional circumstances dictate variation from these procedures, the variation will not invalidate a decision unless it prevented fundamental fairness.\n\n# <a name=\"chargesevidence\" id=\"chargesevidence\"></a>III. Charges and Evidence\n\na. Concerns regarding student behavior may be brought to the Office of Community Standards by any individual, whether or not they are a member of the Middlebury College community.\n\nb. A faculty member who believes a student has engaged in academic dishonesty shall submit a written statement of the facts supporting the charge to the Office of Community Standards. The faculty member's statement will serve as the formal presentation of charges to the Judicial Board, and therefore should be sufficiently detailed to enable all parties to respond and prepare for the hearing, if necessary.\n\nc. The Office of Community Standards may conduct an initial inquiry into the concern to determine whether or not to bring charges against a student. This inquiry may include gathering evidence, including statements from witnesses and documentary evidence, as well as other steps to understand the issue.\n\nd. The Office of Community Standards may have an investigative report prepared, for example by the Department of Public Safety, ITS, or other individual, as appropriate.\n\ne. The Office of Community Standards will ordinarily notify the student with a written statement of the charges being considered, and explain how the student may provide information for consideration.\n\nf. Formal or legal rules of evidence do not apply in Middlebury disciplinary proceedings.  The Office of Community Standards is responsible for administering procedures to ensure they are based on meaningful evidence.  If a hearing occurs, the chair will make decisions on evidentiary or procedural questions that must be resolved during the hearing.  The majority of the Board may override the chair’s decision, if they disagree.\n\n# <a name=\"restorativeresolutions\" id=\"restorativeresolutions\"></a>IV. Restorative Resolutions\n\na. If a student accepts responsibility for violating academic or non-academic policy, a Restorative Justice Panel (RJP) may be called to explore and identify the harm to individuals and/or community, and work with the responsible party to design an action plan and outcomes to repair harm caused.\n\nb. For academic policy violations, the faculty member must be a willing participant in the restorative process and agree to the action plan/outcomes. If the faculty member is unwilling to participate, students may choose to engage the Dean’s Disposition process.\n\nc. For non-academic policy violations, harmed parties are welcome participants in a Restorative Justice Panel, but they are not required to attend, as board members can represent the perspective of the community.\n\nd. All action plans must be approved by the Office of Community Standards. Students participating in a Restorative Justice Panel are required to complete the action plan within the agreed-upon timeline or they will be referred back to the Office for Community Standards for sanctioning.\n\ne. Restorative Panels will be comprised by one faculty, one staff, and two student members of the current Judicial Board.\n\n# <a name=\"deansdisposition\" id=\"deansdisposition\"></a>V. Dean’s Dispositions\n\na. After written notice of the concern or charges against them, and the student’s opportunity to provide evidence, the Office of Community Standards will determine whether there are disputed facts at issue.\n\nb. At any time, a student respondent may notify the Office of Community Standards that they do not contest the charges and the Office may issue a sanction appropriate to the violation.\n\nc. Where there are no disputed facts at issue, the Office of Community Standards will issue a sanction appropriate to the violation.\n\nd. If the student objects to a sanction other than official College discipline, they may submit a statement of their objection within three days to both the Associate Dean and the Dean of Students. The Dean of Students and the Associate Dean shall discuss the sanction and the student’s objection, and provide a written explanation of a decision to retain or adjust the sanction if appropriate.\n\ne. If the sanction is a form of official College discipline for academic misconduct, the respondent may appeal the determination of responsibility to the VPAA/Dean of Faculty, as described below.\n\nf. If the sanction is a form of official College discipline for non-academic misconduct, the respondent may appeal the determination of responsibility to the VPSA or Dean of Students, as described below.\n\n# <a name=\"judicialboard\" id=\"judicialboard\"></a>VI. The Judicial Board\n\n### <a name=\"composition\" id=\"composition\"></a>a. Composition\n\ni. The Judicial Board is comprised of students, faculty and staff, specifically: (1) a member of the faculty or academic administration appointed by the president of Middlebury, (2) two faculty members, (3) four students, (4) a dean of student life, and (5) a staff member.  There will be two student alternates, one faculty alternate, and one staff alternate.  Alternates will only substitute for absent members of their own constituency.  Either the presidential appointee or a dean of student life shall serve as the chair of the Judicial Board.\n\n1.  Faculty Council appoints the faculty members.\n2.  Community Council appoints student members recommended by the selection committee. First-year students may not serve on the Judicial Board, however,  Febs are eligible to apply for the fall semester after their arrival on campus.  A student charged with a serious conduct infraction during their term of service may be required to step down from the Judicial Board, upon the request of the Office of Community Standards or a majority of the Judicial Board.\n3.  Staff members are recommended by Staff Council and appointed by the President.\n4.  After the Judicial Board is constituted, it will elect from its members a student co-chair.  At least one co-chair must be present to convene a hearing.\n\nii. Selection Committee:  The Office of Community Standards will convene a selection committee each spring, including one Community Council student member, one Community Council staff or faculty member, one non-returning student member of the Judicial Board, and one staff or faculty member of the Judicial Board. This selection committee will be responsible for advertising the availability of student positions on the Judicial Board; interviewing applicants; and submitting a slate of student members for the board to the Community Council for ratification. Whenever possible, at least one student member of the Judicial Board will have at least one year of prior experience. A student found guilty of a serious infraction of Middlebury rules by any Middlebury authority will be eligible for membership only after review by the selection committee in consultation with the Dean of Students/Office of Community Standards.\n\niii. If the case involves a technical matter that falls outside the expertise of the members of the Judicial Board, the Office of Community Standards may invite an appropriate faculty and/or student adviser (without voting privileges) to assist the body during a hearing or deliberations.\n\niv. Quorum:  Seven members of the Board shall constitute a quorum, of whom at least three must be students.   A finding of responsibility for a policy violation will result where no more than two Board members vote against a finding of responsibility.\n\nv. Disqualification:   Any member of the Judicial Board who has a conflict of interest in a particular proceeding is disqualified from sitting on that case. If a member of the Board is disqualified, normally an alternate member from the same constituency will be selected to participate. If all of the deans of student life are disqualified from sitting on the Judicial Board in a particular proceeding, the VPSA/DOS will appoint a member of the administration to fulfill the duties of the representative from the Office of the Dean of Students/VPSA. If the faculty or administrative co-chair is disqualified from sitting on the Board in a particular proceeding, the VPSA/DOS will appoint a member of the academic administration to perform the duties of the administrative co-chair in that case.\n\n### <a name=\"hearingprocedures\" id=\"hearingprocedures\"></a>b. Hearing Procedures\n\ni. The Office of Community Standards administers hearings, including but not limited to assisting in scheduling, identifying and approving witnesses, providing required notice to parties, witnesses and Board members, identifying and preparing materials to be reviewed by the Board, and offering access to those materials to the parties.  Staff of the Office must be present during deliberations of the Board and may provide procedural advice to the Board, to ensure consistency and equity.  Staff of the Office serve as secretary to the Board, to formally record factual findings and recommendations of the Board regarding sanction.  Hearings and all Board deliberations are confidential.\n\nii. The burden of proof rests on Middlebury to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the charged conduct occurred.\n\niii. Accused students will be provided with access to the charge statement, if applicable, and all related materials that will be shared with the Board, in advance of a hearing.\n\niv. Normally, a hearing will be scheduled at least one week after the charge statement has been provided to the student. (Shorter deadlines may apply in cases involving seniors at the end of their final term, or with the agreement of the accused student(s).)  Participants will be notified of the date, time and location of the hearing at least two business days before the hearing.\n\nv. The responding student will be notified in advance of the identity of any complainant as well as any witnesses who will attend the hearing.\n\nvi. All written evidence intended to be introduced at the hearing must be provided to the chair of the board prior to the commencement of the hearing. The chair reserves the right not to consider written evidence not provided in advance.\n\nvii. In academic honesty cases, the faculty member initiating charges shall participate in the hearing to explain the charges and to ask and answer questions.\n\nviii. Attendance:  The respondent, complainant, and all required witnesses are expected to be present at the time and place of the scheduled hearing.  Normally, participation in or attendance at judicial hearings shall be limited to students and employees of Middlebury, unless another person can offer directly relevant testimony, which must be approved by the Office of Community Standards. Failure to appear at a scheduled hearing after proper notice may subject a student to disciplinary penalties up to and including suspension. Judicial proceedings take precedence over academic and nonacademic activities, and students shall be excused from other obligations to participate in the proceedings. Should a respondent who has been properly charged and notified of a scheduled hearing fail to appear, the hearing may proceed and sanctions may be imposed as if the respondent were present.\n\nix. Hearings will be recorded, which recording is the property of Middlebury.  In the event of an appeal, the recording will be made available to the respondent and the appellate authority. The respondent must return copies of the recording after filing their appeal; recordings may not be used for any other purposes.  Recordings will be retained for an appropriate period of time and then destroyed.\n\nx. Individuals participating in the hearing as a complainant (including a faculty or staff member) and the student-respondent may each be accompanied by an adviser of his or her choosing from the Middlebury community. This person may be consulted by the respondent during the hearing, but, unless specifically invited by one of the co-chairs, may not otherwise participate in the proceedings. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, each student shall provide the chair with the names of persons serving as their support person. The names will be shared with the respondent and complainant.\n\nxi. The respondent has the right to be present throughout the hearing and to hear adverse testimony. In no case should the Board consider evidence against a student unless the source, author, and content of any statement or other evidence has been identified to the student, and the student has been given the opportunity to rebut the statement or respond to the evidence.\n\nxii. Immediately after a hearing, the Board will deliberate and make determinations of the facts, based on the preponderance of the evidence under consideration at the hearing.  After the facts have been determined, the Judicial Board will make a recommendation to the Office of Community Standards on whether or not the respondent should be found responsible, or not responsible for a policy violation.\n\nxiii. After a finding of responsibility, the Office of Community Standards may share a written character reference relating to the respondent with the Judicial Board, for their consideration in connection with their recommendation for a sanction.\n\nxiv. If a hearing results in a finding of not responsible, there will be no record of the charges or the hearing in the student’s permanent file.\n\nxv. The Office of Community Standards will ordinarily give written notification of the determination of the Board, and the sanction assigned by the Office, to the student charged.  Failure to meet this guideline does not invalidate a decision or form a basis for appeal.\n\n# <a name=\"sanctions\" id=\"sanctions\"></a>VII. Sanctions\n\nMiddlebury College’s sanctions are generally described in Section B. 2\\. e. of the Handbook and the information below is specific to conduct matters addressed under this process.\n\na. After the Board makes the factual findings and if it makes a finding of responsibility, the respondent student is notified by letter.  The student may submit a sanctioning statement, which may include information about significant mitigating circumstances, to the Office of Community Standards, within 24 hours of receiving the outcome letter.\n\nb. Sanctioning Philosophy: When assigning a sanction, mitigating factors such as apparent motivation of behavior or a student’s response to the process may be considered. Additionally, since conduct is cumulative at Middlebury, disciplinary history may be a factor in sanctioning. To the extent possible, sanctions will balance the principles of consistency and equity.\n\nc. Sanctions are ordinarily issued by the Office of Community Standards.  However, Middlebury officials including the VPSA, DOS, Deans, and RDs may issue sanctions when they determine that Middlebury student life policies have been violated.  These officials, and the Office of Community Standards, may also issue restrictions on Middlebury privileges, such as housing lottery participation or guest privileges, and assign educational sanctions such as research or reparative community service, as appropriate.  Students may appeal the issuance of official College discipline by Deans and RDs; they may not appeal unofficial sanctions, such as warnings, reprimands and probationary status.\n\nd. Plagiarism, cheating, or any other violation of the Undergraduate Honor System is normally punishable by suspension. In 1997, the faculty reaffirmed its commitment to suspension as the normal outcome for violations of the standards of academic integrity. Students found guilty of academic dishonesty will normally fail the course in which the offense occurred.  On rare occasions, if compelling reasons exist for not suspending a student found guilty of academic dishonesty, the sanctioning authority may issue no less than a reprimand and invoke either of the following penalties: a 0 or an F on the piece of work, or a 0 or an F in the course.\n\n# <a name=\"appeals\" id=\"appeals\"></a>VIII. Appeals\n\na. Appeals are reviewed by Middlebury authorities who did not participate in the initial determination, and are trained to be impartial and free from a conflict of interest.\n\nb. Appeals are permitted on the following bases only:\n\ni. Discovery of significant new factual evidence not available to the initial decision-maker (does not include omission by the respondent of information or testimony)\n\nii. A procedural error or violation that prevented fundamental fairness.  A determination that a procedural error or violation occurred and prevented fundamental fairness may result in a new determination using the correct procedures but a procedural error is not a factor in reducing a sanction when the appeal upholds the finding of responsibility for violating a policy.\n\nc. Appeal submissions that do not satisfy at least one of these bases will be denied without further process, either by the Office of Community Standards or the appeal authority.\n\nd. A sanction of suspension or expulsion is ordinarily stayed pending the outcome of any appeal authorized by the Handbook. However, in circumstances that satisfy the [Emergency Removals](/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/emerg-removals) provision in Middlebury-Wide Policies, suspension or expulsion will take effect immediately regardless of the pendency of an appeal.\n\ne. Appeals from Dean’s Dispositions and Judicial Board hearing procedures:\n\ni. If the sanction is a form of official College discipline for academic misconduct, the respondent may appeal the determination of responsibility to the VPAA/Dean of Faculty by submitting a written appeal within five business days of being notified of the determination and sanction\n\nii. If the sanction is a form of official College discipline for non-academic misconduct, the respondent may appeal the determination of responsibility by submitting a written appeal within five business days to the VPSA or Dean of Students.\n\niii. Appeals to the VPAA/DOF and the VPSA will follow the same process:\n\n1\\. The VPAA/DOF or the VPSA may grant extensions of time for the respondent to appeal, upon request.   \n2\\. The VPAA/DOF or the VPSA will provide a copy of the written appeal to the Office of Community Standards, and the Office will provide access to the records of the case to the VPAA/DOF or VPSA.  \n3\\. The VPAA/DOF or the VPSA may consult with the Office of Community Standards and any other relevant individual regarding the appeal, as appropriate.   \n4\\. The VPAA/DOF or the VPSA will consider whether the appeal demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence one of the bases for further action, and may require re-consideration by the initial decision-maker, re-convening the original Judicial Board, convening a new Judicial Board, to re-hear the entire matter or only a limited portion, or may require re-deliberation on the sanction.   \n5\\. The VPAA/DOF or the VPSA will ordinarily notify the student of their decision within seven business days of the receipt of the records of the initial determination, but this time may be extended if compelling circumstances warrant, and variation from this shall not invalidate a decision.  \n6\\. If reconsideration of some kind is required, the Office of Community Standards will take the appropriate steps to implement the decision of the VPAA/DOF or the VPSA, as necessary.  \n7\\. Decisions of the VPAA/DOF and the VPSA, or reconsideration of the initial determination by the Dean or the Board after a successful appeal are final, and not subject to further appeal, absent extraordinary circumstances.\n\n_Adopted as a provisional policy on Sept. 11, 2020_\n","excerpt":"I.

Introduction to Middlebury Student Discipline Processes</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"overview\" id=\"overview\"></a>a. Overview</h3>\n<p>Middlebury strives to balance individual growth with community health and growth, through our shared <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/a-introductory-matters\">Community Standards</a>, <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all\">Middlebury-Wide Policies</a>, <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/genl-cond-standards\">General Conduct Standards</a> for students, and the student discipline procedures that enforce general conduct expectations. Our discipline processes are intended to be educational, first and foremost. Where other Middlebury policies specify separate procedures, those procedures will apply.</p>\n<p>The Office of Community Standards and the Judicial Board’s enforcement of Middlebury policies is under the oversight of the Vice-President for Student Affairs and the Dean of Students.  The VPSA/DOS is responsible for consulting with the Vice-President of Academic Affairs/Dean of the Faculty in regards to academic honesty and integrity, and other student conduct expectations.  The VPSA/DOS is responsible for establishing appropriate investigation, adjudication, and appeal procedures for the Judicial Board.  These procedures are published in the Middlebury Handbook.  Suggested revisions may be submitted to the Office of Community Standards, and/or the VPSA at any time, although revisions are ordinarily implemented during the summer.  The Office of Community Standards will make available to the faculty a report about Judicial Board matters in the aggregate, without personally identifiable information, on an annual basis.</p>\n<p>Concerns about student behavior should be shared with the Office of Community Standards as a starting point, although the Office may refer specific behaviors to other processes, for example the TIX Sexual Harassment Investigations &#x26; Resolutions Procedure.   The Office of Community Standards administers the disciplinary procedures for both academic conduct, and student life conduct.  Concerns about academic integrity as well as non-academic student behavior should first directed to the Office of Community Standards, unless they involve discrimination, in which case they should be directed first to the Civil Rights/Title IX Coordinator.</p>\n<p>Conduct matters may be resolved in several ways.  Restorative justice may be available for both academic and non-academic issues.  Conduct issues where the relevant facts are not in dispute will ordinarily be resolved by the assignment of a sanction from the Office of Community Standards.  If a student is assigned a sanction of official college discipline, they may appeal that sanction to the appropriate Vice-President or Dean.  For conduct issues where the facts are disputed, a hearing will be held before the Judicial Board.  The Board will determine the facts and make a recommendation regarding sanction to the Office of Community Standards.  Procedures for Judicial Board hearings are outlined below.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"prelimissues\" id=\"prelimissues\"></a>II. Preliminary Issues</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"applicability\" id=\"applicability\"></a>a. Applicability of These Procedures</h3>\n<p>As described in <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/a-introductory-matters\">Section B.2.a.iii, Scope of Oversight</a>, students will be held accountable for policy violations that take place between the time they first arrive on campus to begin their Middlebury program and their graduation, or the College's confirmation of their withdrawal or resignation.  As described in <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/a-introductory-matters\">Section B.2.a.iv, Pending Discipline</a>, a student respondent will not be permitted to graduate from or otherwise be deemed to have officially completed a Middlebury program in which they are enrolled while a disciplinary matter is pending.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"adminresolution\" id=\"adminresolution\"></a>b. Administrative resolution</h3>\n<p>In certain circumstances, the Office of Community Standards (or the Vice President for Student Affairs/DOS) has discretion to charge an appropriate Middlebury Vice President/Dean, such as the Vice President for Academic Affairs/Dean of the Faculty, to adjudicate a matter. Such circumstances may include adjudicating a matter with compelling privacy interests, such as a case of sexual exploitation, or an alleged violation of an active NCO after the conclusion of an SMDVS investigation, or adjudicating an alleged academic conduct violation during the summer when there are compelling circumstances, etc. While the adjudication process will be tailored to the particular circumstances of the matter, it will adhere to the principle of fundamental fairness for the parties involved. In these cases, the Office of Community Standards or Vice President for Student Affairs may also adjust the sanctioning and appellate authority as necessary.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"NCO\" id=\"NCO\"></a>c. No Contact Orders</h3>\n<p>When a verbal or physical altercation, sexual misconduct, stalking, harassment, discrimination, retaliation, or hazing has been alleged, or when otherwise deemed appropriate under the circumstances, the VPSA, dean of students, deans, Human Relations Officers, Civil Rights/Title IX coordinator, and members of the Public Safety staff have the authority to issue No Contact Orders to the persons involved, whether or not disciplinary action is taken. A No Contact Order is used to restrict encounters between individuals. While a No Contact Order is not a disciplinary sanction, and will not appear on a student’s disciplinary record, refusal to adhere to the order after written or verbal notification of its terms is prohibited and may result in disciplinary action.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"legalproceedings\" id=\"legalproceedings\"></a>d. Legal Proceedings and Legal Counsel</h3>\n<p>Middlebury College disciplinary action is distinct from and not dependent upon the outcome of any legal proceedings involving a student, although conduct that forms the basis for legal proceedings may also warrant disciplinary action by Middlebury, and conviction of a crime may in itself justify disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>Individual students may pursue criminal or civil legal action, or be required to respond to it.  While students are enrolled in any Middlebury program, they must inform Middlebury if they are charged with a felony by state or federal authorities. Failure to do so may itself result in disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>Middlebury endeavors to provide general supports to students involved in personal legal proceedings but has no role to play in such actions, and may not interfere in them.   Middlebury officials and other students may, like all persons, be compelled to give testimony or evidence if subject to the subpoena power of a court.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"cooperation\" id=\"cooperation\"></a>e. Cooperation and Honesty</h3>\n<p>Consistent with Middlebury’s core requirement of honesty and cooperation, students are expected to cooperate in all disciplinary proceedings, be honest and straightforward in their participation, and provide accurate information.  The provision of false or misleading information to the Office of Community Standards or the Judicial Board may itself be grounds for disciplinary action.  Deliberate violations of this provision are considered serious offenses.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"fairness\" id=\"fairness\"></a>f. Principles of Fundamental Fairness</h3>\n<p>Middlebury’s discipline procedures are driven by our commitment to fundamental fairness.  Among the considerations weighed by the Vice President for Student Affairs in establishing these procedures are: (1) ensuring that Middlebury’s conduct expectations are reasonable, (2) ensuring that students have reasonable notice (they know or should have known) about the conduct expectations, (3) providing that disciplinary procedures are carried out by individuals who are properly trained and authorized to act, (4) utilizing procedures that result in outcomes based on meaningful evidence, and (5) ensuring that students have notice of the charges against them, as well as an opportunity to present evidence, and (6) providing for appeals in processes that result in a sanction of official College discipline.</p>\n<p>Colleges are not courts of law, and Middlebury’s disciplinary proceedings have as their fundamental goal <em>education</em>, rather than criminal punishment or compensation.  Middlebury does not have the power to subpoena evidence or place witnesses under oath, and procedures are therefore necessarily different from a civil or criminal legal proceeding. However, the procedures outlined below and in the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-b-1-title-ix-investigation-resolutions-policy\">TIX Sexual Harassment Investigations and Resolutions Procedure</a>, as well as the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin\">Non-Discrimination Investigations and Resolutions Procedure</a>, are designed to provide fundamental fairness and to protect students from arbitrary or capricious disciplinary action. All disciplinary authorities of Middlebury, including judicial board members, deans and Human Relations Officers conduct their proceedings in the spirit of these principles. If exceptional circumstances dictate variation from these procedures, the variation will not invalidate a decision unless it prevented fundamental fairness.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"chargesevidence\" id=\"chargesevidence\"></a>III. Charges and Evidence</h1>\n<p>a. Concerns regarding student behavior may be brought to the Office of Community Standards by any individual, whether or not they are a member of the Middlebury College community.</p>\n<p>b. A faculty member who believes a student has engaged in academic dishonesty shall submit a written statement of the facts supporting the charge to the Office of Community Standards. The faculty member's statement will serve as the formal presentation of charges to the Judicial Board, and therefore should be sufficiently detailed to enable all parties to respond and prepare for the hearing, if necessary.</p>\n<p>c. The Office of Community Standards may conduct an initial inquiry into the concern to determine whether or not to bring charges against a student. This inquiry may include gathering evidence, including statements from witnesses and documentary evidence, as well as other steps to understand the issue.</p>\n<p>d. The Office of Community Standards may have an investigative report prepared, for example by the Department of Public Safety, ITS, or other individual, as appropriate.</p>\n<p>e. The Office of Community Standards will ordinarily notify the student with a written statement of the charges being considered, and explain how the student may provide information for consideration.</p>\n<p>f. Formal or legal rules of evidence do not apply in Middlebury disciplinary proceedings.  The Office of Community Standards is responsible for administering procedures to ensure they are based on meaningful evidence.  If a hearing occurs, the chair will make decisions on evidentiary or procedural questions that must be resolved during the hearing.  The majority of the Board may override the chair’s decision, if they disagree.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"restorativeresolutions\" id=\"restorativeresolutions\"></a>IV. Restorative Resolutions</h1>\n<p>a. If a student accepts responsibility for violating academic or non-academic policy, a Restorative Justice Panel (RJP) may be called to explore and identify the harm to individuals and/or community, and work with the responsible party to design an action plan and outcomes to repair harm caused.</p>\n<p>b. For academic policy violations, the faculty member must be a willing participant in the restorative process and agree to the action plan/outcomes. If the faculty member is unwilling to participate, students may choose to engage the Dean’s Disposition process.</p>\n<p>c. For non-academic policy violations, harmed parties are welcome participants in a Restorative Justice Panel, but they are not required to attend, as board members can represent the perspective of the community.</p>\n<p>d. All action plans must be approved by the Office of Community Standards. Students participating in a Restorative Justice Panel are required to complete the action plan within the agreed-upon timeline or they will be referred back to the Office for Community Standards for sanctioning.</p>\n<p>e. Restorative Panels will be comprised by one faculty, one staff, and two student members of the current Judicial Board.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"deansdisposition\" id=\"deansdisposition\"></a>V. Dean’s Dispositions</h1>\n<p>a. After written notice of the concern or charges against them, and the student’s opportunity to provide evidence, the Office of Community Standards will determine whether there are disputed facts at issue.</p>\n<p>b. At any time, a student respondent may notify the Office of Community Standards that they do not contest the charges and the Office may issue a sanction appropriate to the violation.</p>\n<p>c. Where there are no disputed facts at issue, the Office of Community Standards will issue a sanction appropriate to the violation.</p>\n<p>d. If the student objects to a sanction other than official College discipline, they may submit a statement of their objection within three days to both the Associate Dean and the Dean of Students. The Dean of Students and the Associate Dean shall discuss the sanction and the student’s objection, and provide a written explanation of a decision to retain or adjust the sanction if appropriate.</p>\n<p>e. If the sanction is a form of official College discipline for academic misconduct, the respondent may appeal the determination of responsibility to the VPAA/Dean of Faculty, as described below.</p>\n<p>f. If the sanction is a form of official College discipline for non-academic misconduct, the respondent may appeal the determination of responsibility to the VPSA or Dean of Students, as described below.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"judicialboard\" id=\"judicialboard\"></a>VI. The Judicial Board</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"composition\" id=\"composition\"></a>a. Composition</h3>\n<p>i. The Judicial Board is comprised of students, faculty and staff, specifically: (1) a member of the faculty or academic administration appointed by the president of Middlebury, (2) two faculty members, (3) four students, (4) a dean of student life, and (5) a staff member.  There will be two student alternates, one faculty alternate, and one staff alternate.  Alternates will only substitute for absent members of their own constituency.  Either the presidential appointee or a dean of student life shall serve as the chair of the Judicial Board.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Faculty Council appoints the faculty members.</li>\n<li>Community Council appoints student members recommended by the selection committee. First-year students may not serve on the Judicial Board, however,  Febs are eligible to apply for the fall semester after their arrival on campus.  A student charged with a serious conduct infraction during their term of service may be required to step down from the Judicial Board, upon the request of the Office of Community Standards or a majority of the Judicial Board.</li>\n<li>Staff members are recommended by Staff Council and appointed by the President.</li>\n<li>After the Judicial Board is constituted, it will elect from its members a student co-chair.  At least one co-chair must be present to convene a hearing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>ii. Selection Committee:  The Office of Community Standards will convene a selection committee each spring, including one Community Council student member, one Community Council staff or faculty member, one non-returning student member of the Judicial Board, and one staff or faculty member of the Judicial Board. This selection committee will be responsible for advertising the availability of student positions on the Judicial Board; interviewing applicants; and submitting a slate of student members for the board to the Community Council for ratification. Whenever possible, at least one student member of the Judicial Board will have at least one year of prior experience. A student found guilty of a serious infraction of Middlebury rules by any Middlebury authority will be eligible for membership only after review by the selection committee in consultation with the Dean of Students/Office of Community Standards.</p>\n<p>iii. If the case involves a technical matter that falls outside the expertise of the members of the Judicial Board, the Office of Community Standards may invite an appropriate faculty and/or student adviser (without voting privileges) to assist the body during a hearing or deliberations.</p>\n<p>iv. Quorum:  Seven members of the Board shall constitute a quorum, of whom at least three must be students.   A finding of responsibility for a policy violation will result where no more than two Board members vote against a finding of responsibility.</p>\n<p>v. Disqualification:   Any member of the Judicial Board who has a conflict of interest in a particular proceeding is disqualified from sitting on that case. If a member of the Board is disqualified, normally an alternate member from the same constituency will be selected to participate. If all of the deans of student life are disqualified from sitting on the Judicial Board in a particular proceeding, the VPSA/DOS will appoint a member of the administration to fulfill the duties of the representative from the Office of the Dean of Students/VPSA. If the faculty or administrative co-chair is disqualified from sitting on the Board in a particular proceeding, the VPSA/DOS will appoint a member of the academic administration to perform the duties of the administrative co-chair in that case.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"hearingprocedures\" id=\"hearingprocedures\"></a>b. Hearing Procedures</h3>\n<p>i. The Office of Community Standards administers hearings, including but not limited to assisting in scheduling, identifying and approving witnesses, providing required notice to parties, witnesses and Board members, identifying and preparing materials to be reviewed by the Board, and offering access to those materials to the parties.  Staff of the Office must be present during deliberations of the Board and may provide procedural advice to the Board, to ensure consistency and equity.  Staff of the Office serve as secretary to the Board, to formally record factual findings and recommendations of the Board regarding sanction.  Hearings and all Board deliberations are confidential.</p>\n<p>ii. The burden of proof rests on Middlebury to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the charged conduct occurred.</p>\n<p>iii. Accused students will be provided with access to the charge statement, if applicable, and all related materials that will be shared with the Board, in advance of a hearing.</p>\n<p>iv. Normally, a hearing will be scheduled at least one week after the charge statement has been provided to the student. (Shorter deadlines may apply in cases involving seniors at the end of their final term, or with the agreement of the accused student(s).)  Participants will be notified of the date, time and location of the hearing at least two business days before the hearing.</p>\n<p>v. The responding student will be notified in advance of the identity of any complainant as well as any witnesses who will attend the hearing.</p>\n<p>vi. All written evidence intended to be introduced at the hearing must be provided to the chair of the board prior to the commencement of the hearing. The chair reserves the right not to consider written evidence not provided in advance.</p>\n<p>vii. In academic honesty cases, the faculty member initiating charges shall participate in the hearing to explain the charges and to ask and answer questions.</p>\n<p>viii. Attendance:  The respondent, complainant, and all required witnesses are expected to be present at the time and place of the scheduled hearing.  Normally, participation in or attendance at judicial hearings shall be limited to students and employees of Middlebury, unless another person can offer directly relevant testimony, which must be approved by the Office of Community Standards. Failure to appear at a scheduled hearing after proper notice may subject a student to disciplinary penalties up to and including suspension. Judicial proceedings take precedence over academic and nonacademic activities, and students shall be excused from other obligations to participate in the proceedings. Should a respondent who has been properly charged and notified of a scheduled hearing fail to appear, the hearing may proceed and sanctions may be imposed as if the respondent were present.</p>\n<p>ix. Hearings will be recorded, which recording is the property of Middlebury.  In the event of an appeal, the recording will be made available to the respondent and the appellate authority. The respondent must return copies of the recording after filing their appeal; recordings may not be used for any other purposes.  Recordings will be retained for an appropriate period of time and then destroyed.</p>\n<p>x. Individuals participating in the hearing as a complainant (including a faculty or staff member) and the student-respondent may each be accompanied by an adviser of his or her choosing from the Middlebury community. This person may be consulted by the respondent during the hearing, but, unless specifically invited by one of the co-chairs, may not otherwise participate in the proceedings. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, each student shall provide the chair with the names of persons serving as their support person. The names will be shared with the respondent and complainant.</p>\n<p>xi. The respondent has the right to be present throughout the hearing and to hear adverse testimony. In no case should the Board consider evidence against a student unless the source, author, and content of any statement or other evidence has been identified to the student, and the student has been given the opportunity to rebut the statement or respond to the evidence.</p>\n<p>xii. Immediately after a hearing, the Board will deliberate and make determinations of the facts, based on the preponderance of the evidence under consideration at the hearing.  After the facts have been determined, the Judicial Board will make a recommendation to the Office of Community Standards on whether or not the respondent should be found responsible, or not responsible for a policy violation.</p>\n<p>xiii. After a finding of responsibility, the Office of Community Standards may share a written character reference relating to the respondent with the Judicial Board, for their consideration in connection with their recommendation for a sanction.</p>\n<p>xiv. If a hearing results in a finding of not responsible, there will be no record of the charges or the hearing in the student’s permanent file.</p>\n<p>xv. The Office of Community Standards will ordinarily give written notification of the determination of the Board, and the sanction assigned by the Office, to the student charged.  Failure to meet this guideline does not invalidate a decision or form a basis for appeal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"sanctions\" id=\"sanctions\"></a>VII. Sanctions</h1>\n<p>Middlebury College’s sanctions are generally described in Section B. 2. e. of the Handbook and the information below is specific to conduct matters addressed under this process.</p>\n<p>a. After the Board makes the factual findings and if it makes a finding of responsibility, the respondent student is notified by letter.  The student may submit a sanctioning statement, which may include information about significant mitigating circumstances, to the Office of Community Standards, within 24 hours of receiving the outcome letter.</p>\n<p>b. Sanctioning Philosophy: When assigning a sanction, mitigating factors such as apparent motivation of behavior or a student’s response to the process may be considered. Additionally, since conduct is cumulative at Middlebury, disciplinary history may be a factor in sanctioning. To the extent possible, sanctions will balance the principles of consistency and equity.</p>\n<p>c. Sanctions are ordinarily issued by the Office of Community Standards.  However, Middlebury officials including the VPSA, DOS, Deans, and RDs may issue sanctions when they determine that Middlebury student life policies have been violated.  These officials, and the Office of Community Standards, may also issue restrictions on Middlebury privileges, such as housing lottery participation or guest privileges, and assign educational sanctions such as research or reparative community service, as appropriate.  Students may appeal the issuance of official College discipline by Deans and RDs; they may not appeal unofficial sanctions, such as warnings, reprimands and probationary status.</p>\n<p>d. Plagiarism, cheating, or any other violation of the Undergraduate Honor System is normally punishable by suspension. In 1997, the faculty reaffirmed its commitment to suspension as the normal outcome for violations of the standards of academic integrity. Students found guilty of academic dishonesty will normally fail the course in which the offense occurred.  On rare occasions, if compelling reasons exist for not suspending a student found guilty of academic dishonesty, the sanctioning authority may issue no less than a reprimand and invoke either of the following penalties: a 0 or an F on the piece of work, or a 0 or an F in the course.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"appeals\" id=\"appeals\"></a>VIII. Appeals</h1>\n<p>a. Appeals are reviewed by Middlebury authorities who did not participate in the initial determination, and are trained to be impartial and free from a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>b. Appeals are permitted on the following bases only:</p>\n<p>i. Discovery of significant new factual evidence not available to the initial decision-maker (does not include omission by the respondent of information or testimony)</p>\n<p>ii. A procedural error or violation that prevented fundamental fairness.  A determination that a procedural error or violation occurred and prevented fundamental fairness may result in a new determination using the correct procedures but a procedural error is not a factor in reducing a sanction when the appeal upholds the finding of responsibility for violating a policy.</p>\n<p>c. Appeal submissions that do not satisfy at least one of these bases will be denied without further process, either by the Office of Community Standards or the appeal authority.</p>\n<p>d. A sanction of suspension or expulsion is ordinarily stayed pending the outcome of any appeal authorized by the Handbook. However, in circumstances that satisfy the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/emerg-removals\">Emergency Removals</a> provision in Middlebury-Wide Policies, suspension or expulsion will take effect immediately regardless of the pendency of an appeal.</p>\n<p>e. Appeals from Dean’s Dispositions and Judicial Board hearing procedures:</p>\n<p>i. If the sanction is a form of official College discipline for academic misconduct, the respondent may appeal the determination of responsibility to the VPAA/Dean of Faculty by submitting a written appeal within five business days of being notified of the determination and sanction</p>\n<p>ii. If the sanction is a form of official College discipline for non-academic misconduct, the respondent may appeal the determination of responsibility by submitting a written appeal within five business days to the VPSA or Dean of Students.</p>\n<p>iii. Appeals to the VPAA/DOF and the VPSA will follow the same process:</p>\n<p>1. The VPAA/DOF or the VPSA may grant extensions of time for the respondent to appeal, upon request. <br>\n2. The VPAA/DOF or the VPSA will provide a copy of the written appeal to the Office of Community Standards, and the Office will provide access to the records of the case to the VPAA/DOF or VPSA.<br>\n3. The VPAA/DOF or the VPSA may consult with the Office of Community Standards and any other relevant individual regarding the appeal, as appropriate. <br>\n4. The VPAA/DOF or the VPSA will consider whether the appeal demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence one of the bases for further action, and may require re-consideration by the initial decision-maker, re-convening the original Judicial Board, convening a new Judicial Board, to re-hear the entire matter or only a limited portion, or may require re-deliberation on the sanction. <br>\n5. The VPAA/DOF or the VPSA will ordinarily notify the student of their decision within seven business days of the receipt of the records of the initial determination, but this time may be extended if compelling circumstances warrant, and variation from this shall not invalidate a decision.<br>\n6. If reconsideration of some kind is required, the Office of Community Standards will take the appropriate steps to implement the decision of the VPAA/DOF or the VPSA, as necessary.<br>\n7. Decisions of the VPAA/DOF and the VPSA, or reconsideration of the initial determination by the Dean or the Board after a successful appeal are final, and not subject to further appeal, absent extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p><em>Adopted as a provisional policy on Sept. 11, 2020</em></p>"},"4ef2fe73-c382-5b8a-975b-e402aa0892b7":{"id":"4ef2fe73-c382-5b8a-975b-e402aa0892b7","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/genl-cond-standards","title":"B.2.b.

Policy Against Hazing","body":"\n_Last updated October 4, 2018_\n\nMiddlebury’s [General Conduct Standards](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/genl-cond-standards) include promoting healthy, safe, and balanced lifestyles. Student organizations and athletic teams can play a vital role in this process, and can provide transformative opportunities for friendship, leadership, and personal growth and discovery. Hazing of any kind is antithetical to these goals; therefore, Middlebury prohibits hazing activities, whether by an individual or an organization. In keeping with Middlebury’s prohibition of any kind of hazing, training and educational activities are periodically conducted with appropriate staff who support students and campus life.\n\n**1\\. Policy Statement**\n\nMiddlebury prohibits hazing activities of any kind, whether by an individual or an organization, and including passive participation in hazing activities. Because of the socially coercive nature of hazing, implied or express consent is not a defense under this policy (or under state law). Passive participation in hazing may include witnessing hazing taking place as a group member, affiliate or guest, or participating in or being present in person or via technology in discussions where hazing is planned. Hazing activities violate this policy whether or not they involve alcohol, and whether or not they occur on a Middlebury campus. Hazing activity may lead to disciplinary proceedings against individuals and/or organizations, including but not limited to disciplinary consequences for individuals, and/or the probation, suspension, or termination of a student organization or athletic team. Culpability for any violations of this policy may be attributed to active and passive participants, the student group and/or its members, and elected or appointed officers.\n\nHazing activity is subject to additional penalties or fines and/or criminal prosecution by the state of Vermont; _See_ 16 V.S.A. Sec. [570k](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/16/009/00570k) & [570l](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/16/009/00570l); see also _Referral to Law Enforcement_, below.\n\nThe student leaders of all registered student organizations and athletics programs are required to acknowledge annually that they will comply with the terms of Middlebury’s _Policy Against Hazing_. Retaliation against any individual, directly or indirectly, for making or participating in a complaint about hazing is prohibited under Middlebury’s general [Retaliation policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/genl-principles/respectful-behavior).\n\n**2\\. Definitions**\n\nFor purposes of this policy, hazing is defined as any act committed by a person, whether individually or in concert with others, against a student in connection with pledging, being initiated into, affiliating with, holding office in, participating in, or maintaining membership in any organization or team that is affiliated with Middlebury; and that is intended to have the effect of, or should reasonably be expected to have the effect of, humiliating, intimidating or demeaning the student or endangering the mental or physical health of the student. Hazing also includes planning, soliciting, directing, aiding, or otherwise participating actively or passively in the above acts.\n\nActivity or conduct that furthers legitimate curricular, extracurricular, or military training program goals is not considered to be hazing, provided that:\n\n(i) the goals are approved by a Middlebury official who oversees the activities of the organization or team (e.g., coach or director of student activities); and\n\n(ii) the activity or conduct furthers the goals in a manner that is appropriate, contemplated by Middlebury, and normal and customary for similar programs at other educational institutions.\n\n\"Organization\" means an athletic team, association, corporation, order, society, corps, cooperative, club, student organization, or other similar group, whose members primarily are students at Middlebury, and which is affiliated with Middlebury.\n\n\"Pledging\" means any action or activity related to becoming a member of an organization.\n\n\"Student\" includes but is not limited to any person who is enrolled in or pursuing a degree or credit in any Middlebury program.\n\n**a. Examples**\n\nMiddlebury policies include the prohibition of many activities that have traditionally been associated with hazing, such as illegal substance use and abuse, vandalism, theft, verbal or physical abuse or threat of harm, sexual harassment, and other forms of harassment. In addition to those activities and conduct expressly prohibited elsewhere in this Handbook, examples of prohibited individual/group activities that may constitute hazing when otherwise falling within the definition above include but are not limited to the following:\n\ni. Encouraging the use of alcohol or illegal drugs\n\nii. Shaving, tattooing, piercing or branding\n\niii. Engaging in or simulating sexual acts\n\niv.Threatening or causing physical restraint\n\nv. Nudity\n\nvi. Throwing substances or objects at individuals\n\nvii. Assigning unreasonable chores or acts of servitude\n\nviii. Forcing or coercing consumption or use of any substance\n\nix. Causing excessive exercise, sleep deprivation or excessive fatigue\n\nx. Interfering with adequate time for study\n\nxi. Requiring the wearing of apparel or acting in a way that is conspicuous and not within community norms\n\nxii. Blindfolding\n\nxiii. Subjecting students to abusive or demeaning conduct\n\n**3\\. Policy Violation Review Process**\n\n<span>a. Authority</span>  \nThe Vice President for Student Affairs/Dean of the College or an appropriate designee (hereinafter referred to as “VPSA”) monitors the implementation of this policy and imposes sanctions for violations. Any questions concerning the interpretation or application of this policy should be referred to the VPSA.\n\n<span>b. Reporting</span>  \nAll Middlebury community members are expected to report activities believed to be hazing to a Commons dean, director of Athletics, associate dean for student activities, or the VPSA. <span>See</span> contact information below.\n\n<span>c. Process</span>  \ni. When an allegation of hazing or related retaliation is made, the VPSA or appropriate designee will determine initially whether the report or complaint alleges conduct that is prohibited by this policy and whether an investigation should be initiated. The VPSA may also suspend the activities of the organization or the activities of individual members thereof pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\nii. If the VPSA determines that an investigation should proceed, an investigator(s) will be appointed to conduct an investigation. The investigator is authorized to contact any and all individuals with potentially relevant information, and to access relevant records and documents. The nature and scope of the investigation is within the discretion of the investigator and/or the VPSA.\n\niii. All participants in the investigation are expected to cooperate fully by providing complete, accurate, and truthful information, including documents, evidence, statements, etc. Participants may be asked to keep the substance of their interview with the investigator confidential.\n\niv. After the investigation is completed, the investigator shall issue a report to the VPSA that includes recommended findings, based on a preponderance of the evidence standard, i.e., whether it was more likely than not that this policy was violated. The report may be issued in a form appropriate to the nature of the investigation, including oral reporting, and will be accompanied by all evidentiary material considered in the investigation.\n\nv. Prior to the VPSA’s determination, the VPSA will provide a summary of allegations to the student leaders of the organization under investigation, and the organization will have an opportunity to provide a responsive statement by a deadline established by the VPSA.\n\nvi. After review of the investigator’s report, the evidentiary material and the responsive statement, if submitted, the VPSA shall issue a determination as to whether hazing occurred, based on a preponderance of the evidence standard. The complaining party, if identified, and the responding party under investigation will ordinarily be notified of the VPSA’s determination as to whether there was a policy violation.\n\n**<span>4\\. Sanctions</span>**\n\na. Sanctions for organizations may range from permanent suspension of recognition or authorization to operate, through cancellation, termination or restriction of activities and events, and other sanctions tailored to the particular circumstances.\n\nb. Sanctions for individuals may include all of the usual sanctions under Middlebury’s [disciplinary policies](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/general-disciplinary-process#sanctions), fines and restitution, as well as other sanctions tailored to the particular circumstances. The VPSA may refer hazing allegations concerning individual students to a judicial affairs officer for review, adjudication and sanctioning under the [General Disciplinary Process](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/general-disciplinary-process).\n\n**5\\. Additional Policy Violations**\n\nReported incidents may be referred to a judicial affairs officer, human relations officer, or other Middlebury official, as appropriate to the circumstances, to address alleged violations of other Middlebury policies, including but not limited to Middlebury’s [General Conduct Standards](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/genl-cond-standards), [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin) and [Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic and Dating Violence and Misconduct and Stalking](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/smdvs).\n\n**6\\. Referral to Law Enforcement**\n\nMiddlebury will ordinarily report allegations of hazing to law enforcement authorities when, in the judgment of the VPSA, the nature of the allegations suggests that the hazing activity, if it occurred or is occurring, presents a risk of serious harm to students or other persons, or involves a potentially serious violation of law.\n\n**7\\.

Enrolled students are required to live on campus for all 8 eight semesters and participate in the dining plan.  A small number of upper class students may be permitted to live off-campus as authorized by the office of the Dean of Students (DOS).  The procedure to request permission is [below](#requesting). The College assigns housing and reserves the right to change and alter housing assignments to better serve compelling community interests.\n\n**<a name=\"housing\" id=\"housing\"></a>(2) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Housing options on Campus</span>**\n\nAt Middlebury College, students are offered more than 60 on-campus buildings for student housing. All students are assigned to one of five [Commons](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/residential-life/commons-system) for the first two years. Juniors and seniors can choose from other housing options available across campus while remaining a member of their original Commons. Middlebury maintains houses in the belief that they can be a positive addition to the larger campus community and that they provide students with valuable opportunities for assuming responsibility for activities and programs that support the life of the Middlebury community.\n\nIn addition to First year and Sophomore housing with the Commons, the College offers Academic and Special Interest Houses that students can join on campus for students interested in pursuing common academic, co-curricular, and special interests. Oversight of these houses is the shared responsibility of the Office of the Dean of Students and the academic (in the case of Academic Interest houses) or administrative (in the case of special interest houses) department sponsoring the house. Rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors are eligible to reside in Academic Interest Houses. Students can choose from the other housing options in their junior and senior year.\n\nMore information on joining these houses and the Room Draw process can be found at: [https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/housing-information](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/housing-information)\n\nMiddlebury reserves the right to reassign, restrict, and, suspend student housing where that decision will serve a compelling community interest, or in instances where a student has demonstrated a flagrant and/or repeated disregard for the principles set forth in the Handbook. This includes the restriction from participating in room draw and housing selection.\n\n**<a name=\"student\" id=\"student\"></a>(3) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Student Responsibilities and Expectations</span>**\n\nResidential Living Spaces are provided for Middlebury students only.\n\nStudents are responsible for what takes place in their rooms and common suite space, including parties and other activities, whether or not they are present. It is the student’s responsibility to maintain clean and sanitary conditions in dormitory rooms, and must clear common space after personal use.\n\nStudents cannot switch rooms and keys or change residences without proper permission.\n\nStudents are not expected to be in areas that are not regular living spaces. They should not use areas outside of their living spaces for storage unless authorized. The list of spaces excluded from student use includes any roof or outer surface of any Middlebury building. Accessing a roof in any manner or climbing on a building is considered dangerous behavior and is prohibited; fines will be assessed.  Unauthorized access to prohibited areas of Middlebury buildings (e. g. basements, closets, crawlspaces and/or attics) will incur fines (see [section on fines and fees](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/support/sfs/sfs-handbook)).\n\nStudents are expected to be considerate of others with respect to noise in the residence halls; see [Noise Regulations](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/Noise_Regulations) for more information. Conduct that creates a public disturbance in a residence hall or interferes with another student’s ability to study is prohibited.\n\nStudents are expected to be responsible for their personal valuables and belongings. Middlebury does not accept responsibility for loss of money or other personal property or damage thereto which may occur in residence halls and elsewhere on campus. Students may wish to insure their property against such loss.\n\nStudents may not remove Middlebury-provided furniture from their bedroom for any reason, including but not limited to bedframes, mattresses, dressers, bookcases, chairs, desks and wardrobes. Removal of any College furniture without proper permission will result in a fine. Limited medical or ADA exceptions may be granted with appropriate approval. For a list of furniture that are not allowed on campus, please read [here](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/residential-life-policies/apprv-furniture).\n\n**<a name=\"use\" id=\"use\"></a>(4) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Use of Residential Spaces</span>**\n\n**<a name=\"living\" id=\"living\"></a>(a) Living and Learning**\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Residential spaces are ordinarily entitled to a higher degree of privacy than public spaces</span>. Residences are provided to support the co-curricular learning.  However, the overall safety of our campus and our community justifies balancing individual expectations of privacy vs. community interests.  Solicitation in residence halls for any purpose by persons outside the Middlebury community is prohibited.\n\n**<a name=\"guest\" id=\"guest\"></a>(b) Guest Policy**\n\nA guest of a student may stay in a dormitory no more than three days in any one term. All guests must register in advance with the Department of Public Safety.  Residential Life staff must be told in advance where the guest is staying. No guests may stay overnight in residential lounges, or stay overnight on campus when Middlebury is closed. Students are responsible for the behavior of their guests. Middlebury reserves the right to remove any guest whose behavior is not appropriate, and to rescind the privilege of hosting guests. Failure to follow the guest policy will result in fines and loss of privilege to host guests.See [guest policy](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/use-of-residential-spaces/residential-guests).\n\n**<a name=\"entry\" id=\"entry\"></a>(c) Entry by College Officials**\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">i. Entry into Student Residence Halls, Houses and Suites</span>  \nThe Department of Public Safety is responsible for patrolling residential areas on campus and may enter student residence halls and houses in order to perform their duties (examples: locking the building, responding to complaints and calls for service, party checks, etc.). Since many residential houses need to be patrolled and may require checks or locking (examples: Homestead, Jewett, Weybridge, The Mill), officers may enter the communal areas as appropriate. Public Safety officers respect a student's right to privacy and do not enter more private areas such as suites or very small houses without knocking and gaining permission to enter, unless conducting a party check, addressing significant Middlebury policy violations, or in accordance with the other entry policies listed above.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">ii. Possession and Securing of Evidence</span>   \nThe Department of Public Safety is authorized to enter a student's residence to take possession of and secure evidence of a serious Middlebury policy violation. Department of Public Safety and other Middlebury officials should enter a student's room only under certain circumstances and in conformity with the procedures outlined in Entry into Residential Rooms. In the event that stolen property or prohibited/illegal goods are observed, the items will be confiscated, notice will be sent to the Commons for appropriate action, and the occupants of the room will be notified.\n\n- <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Procedure for Entry in Non-Emergency Situation</span>\n\n- <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Community Service</span>  \n  Middlebury officials may enter a student dormitory room to perform a community service: e.g., to turn off an unattended alarm clock or radio, to mitigate property damage, or to allow authorized designees to retrieve residents’ belongings.\n\n- <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Routine Inspections and Repairs</span>  \n  Middlebury conducts routine inspections of student rooms in the dormitories to check on violations of health and safety regulations and to recover misappropriated property. Inspections are held at reasonable times, in a manner that will least inconvenience residents. Students are notified by voice-mail and written notice at least 24 hours but not more than two weeks prior to the inspection. Students discovered in violation of health and safety regulations, or in possession of stolen property or illegal goods, are subject to normal Middlebury disciplinary action as appropriate. During vacation periods, student rooms in Middlebury-owned housing are inspected to check heat settings, to ensure that lights and appliances are turned off, and that windows are closed. Following such inspections, or at other times, facilities services personnel may enter student rooms to make repairs. (See [Notification of Entry, below](#notification).) Occasionally, Middlebury officials may need to enter a room for reasons other than those listed in this section, such as to evaluate a room for planning purposes and space needs. In these circumstances, 24-hour notice will be given and the requester will attempt to coordinate a mutually agreeable time with the student.\n\n- <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Communications Infrastructure Maintenance  \n  </span>Improperly configured or malfunctioning computer or communication equipment can seriously degrade the operation of Middlebury's communication networks. It may be necessary for personnel to enter a student room to confirm the location of such a device, and, if necessary, disconnect it from the network until the situation can be resolved. ITS will attempt to contact the student before entering the room, but time-critical situations, where significant network services are impacted, may require entry without prior approval. Students' computers will not be touched without their prior consent; room entry will be only for the purpose of confirming that the misbehaving computer has been properly identified. For the protection of the student, the Department of Public Safety and/or the Commons office will be notified if entry is made without prior approval. Any temporary disconnection will be made in the network equipment closet, without directly handling students' property.\n\n- If students request assistance from ITS to repair a problem with their network connection, they may give ITS permission to enter the room and disconnect equipment for testing and troubleshooting in their absence. Similarly, Telephone Services personnel may enter student rooms in the residents' absence to effect repairs to voice telephone equipment or infrastructure. (See [Notification of Entry, below](#notification).)\n\n- <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Procedure for Entry in Emergency Situation</span>\n\n- <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Emergency Entry</span>   \n  Middlebury officials are authorized to enter a student's room without prior notice in emergency circumstances, such as a fire, fire alarm, fire drill, an immediate threat to health, safety or property, a call for help, or what reasonably seems to constitute an emergency situation.\n\n- <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Special Room Inspection</span>  \n  In addition to the circumstances described above, Middlebury officials may initiate entry of a room and/or a room search when there is reason to believe that a serious violation of Middlebury policy has been committed and/or the evidence may be found in a student's room. Searches of this nature will not be conducted without prior authorization of an appropriate senior Middlebury official. When possible, the student or students concerned and a witness shall be present when a room search is conducted. (See [Notification of Entry, below](#notification).)\n\n- Students living in Middlebury-owned housing have the right to be free from unlawful room searches conducted by law enforcement officials. In most instances, a lawful search must be conducted pursuant to a warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause. Middlebury officials must arrange with law enforcement authorities to obtain a search warrant before searching a student's room for evidence which they intend to turn over for purposes of criminal prosecution. If a police officer sees a student commit what reasonably appears to be a criminal offense or violation of local ordinances, however, Middlebury will not interfere with the officer's legal pursuit of the student into a dormitory and into a student room. Similarly, a Department of Public Safety officer who sees a student commit what reasonably appears to be a crime or a violation of Middlebury regulations has the right to pursue the student into a dormitory and into a student room.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><a name=\"notification\" id=\"notification\"></a>Notification of Entry</span>  \nWhenever a student's dormitory room is entered by a Middlebury official to meet an emergency, to make a repair, to carry out a community service, to conduct a routine inspection, or to conduct an authorized search, a note will be left indicating the time, date, reason, and name of the Middlebury person or office responsible, unless the occupant of the room is present at the time of entry.\n\n**<a name=\"housing\" id=\"housing\"></a>(d) Housing Regulations & Resources**\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><a name=\"firesafety\" id=\"firesafety\"></a>Fire Safety Regulations</span>**\n\nAny violation of fire safety regulations will result in a [fine](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/support/sfs/sfs-handbook).  Students found responsible will have to pay the additional cost(s) of repair or replacement of damaged equipment or property.  Students will be subject to disciplinary actions as well.\n\n- Room entries, exits and hallways must be kept clear and free of potential obstructions.\n\n- Nothing may be hung from a sprinkler apparatus or sprinkler piping.\n\n- Only two walls of any room may be draped. Ceilings may not be covered with tapestries or other materials. Other wall hangings and posters may be prohibited if a fire or egress hazard is created.\n\n- Nothing may be built or placed over or around a room radiator that will interfere with the free flow of air around the radiator or prevent easy access to service it.\n\n- The following items are prohibited: halogen lamps, portable heaters, fuel, dangerous chemicals, fireworks, hazardous materials, new or burned candles, incense, oil lamps, oil/wax diffusers that sit on lightbulbs or other items with the capability of an open flame or burning embers.\n\n- String lights are prohibited, with the exception of LED lights in good working condition (no frayed or bare wires, cracked sockets, loose connections or damaged insulation).  LED lights are acceptable ONLY if they are labeled with Underwriters Laboratory (UL) approval. Tags with this information are required to be on each string of lights. LED string lights may not be placed over doorways, on ceilings or wrapped around any sprinkler piping, furniture or other cloth items such as curtains or wall hangings. LED lights may not be attached with nails or staples. LED lights must be plugged directly into an outlet or surge protector and may not be strung together.  If it cannot be verified that the lights are LED, the College has the right to remove them.\n\n- Smoking is prohibited in all campus buildings, including the small residential houses. This includes porches, balconies, decks, or within 25 feet of any part of the building structure. E-cigarette smoking is also prohibited in campus buildings.\n\n- The use of portable fire pits is prohibited.\n\n- Use of fire, or lighting a fire without an authorized fire permit, inside or outside of buildings, other than smoking in authorized outdoor spaces, is prohibited. The use of outdoor grills is limited to authorized locations at small houses and must be approved before use.\n\n- Several College residence halls and lounges have working fireplaces. Before using a fireplace, permission is required from the Commons office associated with the residence.  Fires in fireplaces should never be unattended and there should always be a fire extinguisher present in the vicinity when there is any fire in the fireplace. The use of chemical fire starters is prohibited.\n\n- Tampering with fire- or life-safety equipment is prohibited and subject to fines. These charges will be borne collectively by the residence hall if the responsible individual(s) cannot be identified. “Fire- and life-safety equipment” includes fire alarms, fire doors, pull stations, extinguishers, hydrants, smoke detectors, smoke detector batteries, carbon monoxide detectors, and sprinklers.\n\n- Students must exit a building when a fire alarm sounds; fines may be assessed for failure to do so. Fire escapes may only be accessed during fire drills or a fire emergency.\n\n- Appliances that have exposed heating elements, including but not limited to toasters, toaster ovens, hot plates, sandwich makers, electric frying pans or grills, electric woks, deep fryers, popcorn poppers (other than hot air poppers) and irons without automatic shutoffs may not be used in student rooms.  Small cooking appliances without exposed heating elements, such as rice cookers, steamers, and crockpots may be used in residential kitchen spaces.  These items must be attended while in use.  Such appliances may not be used in student rooms.  Storage of these appliances should be discussed with your Commons office. Please also see a list of [allowable items](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/residential-life/housing-overview/housing-resources) on the Residential Life webpage.\n\n- The use of fog and smoke machines in campus residential buildings is prohibited.\n\n- Possession of flammable decorations including wreaths, sawn trees, corn stalks and shucks, tree branches, dry leaves, hay straw, paper streamers, saw dust or wood shaving is prohibited.\n\n- Possession of large appliances such as refrigerators in excess of 3.8 cubic feet, freezers, washers, or dryers is prohibited.\n\n- Construction of partitions, subdividing rooms, construction of additions, installation or modification or electrical wiring or plumbing, or altering means of egress is prohibited.\n\nFire Safety inspections will be organized and conducted on an on-going basis as deemed appropriate.  Students will be reminded that inspections will occur at the beginning of each semester, and will be advised of the conditions following the inspections.  Any material in violation of the fire safety regulations will be confiscated at the time of the inspection, and the student fined.\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><a name=\"noise\" id=\"noise\"></a>Noise Regulations</span>**  \nMiddlebury seeks to promote the quiet, comfort, and health of the campus community and residents of the town of Middlebury. The student body must uphold the Ordinance for the Regulation of Noise of the town of Middlebury. This ordinance prohibits excessive or unnecessary noise, including vocal disturbances and loud music, and punishes offenders with fines.  Students should neither cause nor condone excessive amounts of noise, but should strive to be considerate and respectful of others. Students are informed about Middlebury’s noise regulations by the residential life staff. Procedures on Noise Complaints can be found [here](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/Noise_Regulations).\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Storage Regulations  \n</span>**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"></span>\n\nStudents leaving Middlebury College at any time during the academic year are responsible for packing their belongings and arranging for storage or shipping. Storage during the regular academic year for undergraduate Middlebury students:\n\n1.  *Regular dormitory storage* (trunks, suitcases, boxed items).  \n    i. Storage for some student belongings during the academic year is provided in some campus buildings. Interested students should consult with their resident assistant.  \n    ii. At the end of the school year, Facilities Services staff will clean out these storage areas and will dispose of any items not removed by students.\n2.  _House Storage_  \n    Houses may only store house items, such as pool tables and composites, in their houses over the summer recess. Personal items may not be left in the social houses. The president of each social house is responsible for supervising the storage area.\n\n**<a name=\"requesting\" id=\"requesting\"></a>(5) Requesting Changes or Off-Campus Housing**\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Changing Housing Assignment</span>**\n\nStudents are assigned housing by the College through the room draw process. If students are experiencing a roommate conflict, they are highly encouraged to speak with their Residential Life staff or CRA before approaching the Commons dean or submitting a room-change request.\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Procedure to Request Room Change</span>**\n\nMid-term room change requests may be submitted following the end of the second week of classes and will be considered in mid-October and mid-March.  Requests submitted during J-Term, and after the fall and spring deadlines will be considered on a case-by-case basis.   End of Term room change requests (fall and J-term) should be submitted to the residential systems coordinator by the assigned date.\n\nIf a student is offered a mid-semester room change, the student has 48 hours to accept or reject the offer. If students have a double as a single for whatever reason, they must find an eligible roommate, or the residential systems coordinator will assign someone to fill the space. Students will always be encouraged to resolve any conflicts before considering a room change.\n\nAs noted above, switching rooms and keys or changing residences without authorization is prohibited and subject to [fines](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/student-financial-services/financial-tools-and-resources/student-financial-services-handbook).\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Procedure to Request Off Campus Housing</span>**\n\n**Off campus housing**  \nA limited number of releases are available for senior students to live off campus with prior approval from Residential Life. Students with special medical needs that necessitate a housing accommodation should address their concerns to Residential Life and the Student Accessibility Services. Students who are married or have dependent children living with them are exempted from the residency and board requirements upon providing documentation to Residential Life.\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Procedure to Request Living Off-Campus</span>**\n\nMiddlebury permits a limited number of seniors to live off campus. Permission is granted by a process coordinated by the Office of the Dean of Students. Students with the status of \"special students\" are required to live off campus. The number of off-campus residents is based on our commitment to the residential experience and an evaluation of the rental market in the town of Middlebury. Off-Campus status requires the approval of the Commons dean. Approval may not be granted if a student has been subject to official College discipline or academic failure.  Students living off campus must provide their local address and phone number to Middlebury’s residential systems coordinator within the first five days of the term or the Off-Campus Fee Reduction will be forfeited.\n\nAll Off-Campus forms must be turned in to the residential systems coordinator by the determined [deadlines](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/residential-life/housing-overview). Any student wishing to move off campus after the Off-Campus application deadline must notify the residential systems coordinator to be placed on a waiting list. Off-campus permission is granted through a random draw each term for the subsequent term. Applications are submitted electronically; students may apply as individuals or in groups up to three members.  Students who accept off-campus housing status are ineligible to participate in further fall term housing processes.\n\nPermission must be granted for each term a student wants to live off campus and an Off-Campus Fee Reduction Form must be submitted by the posted deadline.  A form submitted one term will not automatically transfer to the next term. Students living off campus for one term will be given priority to live off campus for the next term as long as there have been no disciplinary, academic or behavioral concerns raised during the previous term. Completing the form every term provides the Office of the Dean of Students with up-to-date residential information.\n\nStudents who accept off-campus housing status and then request to move back on campus will be placed on a waiting list and housed by the residential systems coordinator following the completion of the housing processes taking place at that time.  There is no guarantee of housing for these students.\n\nStudents who choose to live off-campus without authorization - that is, students who are not granted off-campus status but move off-campus nonetheless - will be subject to official discipline.\n\nStudents who live off campus are expected to be good citizens. Students who violate Middlebury policy or local ordinances will be subject to Middleburydiscipline.\n\nLiving on campus is considered to be an essential component of the educational experience at Middlebury. Request for off-campus housing on the basis of a medical or ADA-certified need will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will require appropriate documentation.\n\n**<a name=\"termination\" id=\"termination\"></a>(6) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Termination of a House</span>**\n\nThe Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students (VPSA) will recommend to the President termination of a house at Middlebury in the following circumstances:\n\na. for disciplinary reasons if there is an extraordinary violation by a house of Middlebury’s rules and regulations for students in houses.\n\nb.for disciplinary reasons if there are repeated violations by a house of Middlebury rules and regulations.  The VPSA may issue appropriate sanctions to a house for violations of rules and regulations. Sanctions may include disciplinary probation, which will involve the loss of the right to hold parties and of other privileges to be specified by the Office of the Dean of Students.

Enrolled students are required to live on campus for all 8 eight semesters and participate in the dining plan.  A small number of upper class students may be permitted to live off-campus as authorized by the office of the Dean of Students (DOS).  The procedure to request permission is <a href=\"#requesting\">below</a>. The College assigns housing and reserves the right to change and alter housing assignments to better serve compelling community interests.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"housing\" id=\"housing\"></a>(2) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Housing options on Campus</span></strong></p>\n<p>At Middlebury College, students are offered more than 60 on-campus buildings for student housing. All students are assigned to one of five <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/residential-life/commons-system\">Commons</a> for the first two years. Juniors and seniors can choose from other housing options available across campus while remaining a member of their original Commons. Middlebury maintains houses in the belief that they can be a positive addition to the larger campus community and that they provide students with valuable opportunities for assuming responsibility for activities and programs that support the life of the Middlebury community.</p>\n<p>In addition to First year and Sophomore housing with the Commons, the College offers Academic and Special Interest Houses that students can join on campus for students interested in pursuing common academic, co-curricular, and special interests. Oversight of these houses is the shared responsibility of the Office of the Dean of Students and the academic (in the case of Academic Interest houses) or administrative (in the case of special interest houses) department sponsoring the house. Rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors are eligible to reside in Academic Interest Houses. Students can choose from the other housing options in their junior and senior year.</p>\n<p>More information on joining these houses and the Room Draw process can be found at: <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/housing-information\">https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/housing-information</a></p>\n<p>Middlebury reserves the right to reassign, restrict, and, suspend student housing where that decision will serve a compelling community interest, or in instances where a student has demonstrated a flagrant and/or repeated disregard for the principles set forth in the Handbook. This includes the restriction from participating in room draw and housing selection.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"student\" id=\"student\"></a>(3) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Student Responsibilities and Expectations</span></strong></p>\n<p>Residential Living Spaces are provided for Middlebury students only.</p>\n<p>Students are responsible for what takes place in their rooms and common suite space, including parties and other activities, whether or not they are present. It is the student’s responsibility to maintain clean and sanitary conditions in dormitory rooms, and must clear common space after personal use.</p>\n<p>Students cannot switch rooms and keys or change residences without proper permission.</p>\n<p>Students are not expected to be in areas that are not regular living spaces. They should not use areas outside of their living spaces for storage unless authorized. The list of spaces excluded from student use includes any roof or outer surface of any Middlebury building. Accessing a roof in any manner or climbing on a building is considered dangerous behavior and is prohibited; fines will be assessed.  Unauthorized access to prohibited areas of Middlebury buildings (e. g. basements, closets, crawlspaces and/or attics) will incur fines (see <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/support/sfs/sfs-handbook\">section on fines and fees</a>).</p>\n<p>Students are expected to be considerate of others with respect to noise in the residence halls; see <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/Noise_Regulations\">Noise Regulations</a> for more information. Conduct that creates a public disturbance in a residence hall or interferes with another student’s ability to study is prohibited.</p>\n<p>Students are expected to be responsible for their personal valuables and belongings. Middlebury does not accept responsibility for loss of money or other personal property or damage thereto which may occur in residence halls and elsewhere on campus. Students may wish to insure their property against such loss.</p>\n<p>Students may not remove Middlebury-provided furniture from their bedroom for any reason, including but not limited to bedframes, mattresses, dressers, bookcases, chairs, desks and wardrobes. Removal of any College furniture without proper permission will result in a fine. Limited medical or ADA exceptions may be granted with appropriate approval. For a list of furniture that are not allowed on campus, please read <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/residential-life-policies/apprv-furniture\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"use\" id=\"use\"></a>(4) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Use of Residential Spaces</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"living\" id=\"living\"></a>(a) Living and Learning</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Residential spaces are ordinarily entitled to a higher degree of privacy than public spaces</span>. Residences are provided to support the co-curricular learning.  However, the overall safety of our campus and our community justifies balancing individual expectations of privacy vs. community interests.  Solicitation in residence halls for any purpose by persons outside the Middlebury community is prohibited.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"guest\" id=\"guest\"></a>(b) Guest Policy</strong></p>\n<p>A guest of a student may stay in a dormitory no more than three days in any one term. All guests must register in advance with the Department of Public Safety.  Residential Life staff must be told in advance where the guest is staying. No guests may stay overnight in residential lounges, or stay overnight on campus when Middlebury is closed. Students are responsible for the behavior of their guests. Middlebury reserves the right to remove any guest whose behavior is not appropriate, and to rescind the privilege of hosting guests. Failure to follow the guest policy will result in fines and loss of privilege to host guests.See <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/use-of-residential-spaces/residential-guests\">guest policy</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"entry\" id=\"entry\"></a>(c) Entry by College Officials</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">i. Entry into Student Residence Halls, Houses and Suites</span><br>\nThe Department of Public Safety is responsible for patrolling residential areas on campus and may enter student residence halls and houses in order to perform their duties (examples: locking the building, responding to complaints and calls for service, party checks, etc.). Since many residential houses need to be patrolled and may require checks or locking (examples: Homestead, Jewett, Weybridge, The Mill), officers may enter the communal areas as appropriate. Public Safety officers respect a student's right to privacy and do not enter more private areas such as suites or very small houses without knocking and gaining permission to enter, unless conducting a party check, addressing significant Middlebury policy violations, or in accordance with the other entry policies listed above.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">ii. Possession and Securing of Evidence</span> <br>\nThe Department of Public Safety is authorized to enter a student's residence to take possession of and secure evidence of a serious Middlebury policy violation. Department of Public Safety and other Middlebury officials should enter a student's room only under certain circumstances and in conformity with the procedures outlined in Entry into Residential Rooms. In the event that stolen property or prohibited/illegal goods are observed, the items will be confiscated, notice will be sent to the Commons for appropriate action, and the occupants of the room will be notified.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Procedure for Entry in Non-Emergency Situation</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Community Service</span><br>\nMiddlebury officials may enter a student dormitory room to perform a community service: e.g., to turn off an unattended alarm clock or radio, to mitigate property damage, or to allow authorized designees to retrieve residents’ belongings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Routine Inspections and Repairs</span><br>\nMiddlebury conducts routine inspections of student rooms in the dormitories to check on violations of health and safety regulations and to recover misappropriated property. Inspections are held at reasonable times, in a manner that will least inconvenience residents. Students are notified by voice-mail and written notice at least 24 hours but not more than two weeks prior to the inspection. Students discovered in violation of health and safety regulations, or in possession of stolen property or illegal goods, are subject to normal Middlebury disciplinary action as appropriate. During vacation periods, student rooms in Middlebury-owned housing are inspected to check heat settings, to ensure that lights and appliances are turned off, and that windows are closed. Following such inspections, or at other times, facilities services personnel may enter student rooms to make repairs. (See <a href=\"#notification\">Notification of Entry, below</a>.) Occasionally, Middlebury officials may need to enter a room for reasons other than those listed in this section, such as to evaluate a room for planning purposes and space needs. In these circumstances, 24-hour notice will be given and the requester will attempt to coordinate a mutually agreeable time with the student.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Communications Infrastructure Maintenance<br>\n</span>Improperly configured or malfunctioning computer or communication equipment can seriously degrade the operation of Middlebury's communication networks. It may be necessary for personnel to enter a student room to confirm the location of such a device, and, if necessary, disconnect it from the network until the situation can be resolved. ITS will attempt to contact the student before entering the room, but time-critical situations, where significant network services are impacted, may require entry without prior approval. Students' computers will not be touched without their prior consent; room entry will be only for the purpose of confirming that the misbehaving computer has been properly identified. For the protection of the student, the Department of Public Safety and/or the Commons office will be notified if entry is made without prior approval. Any temporary disconnection will be made in the network equipment closet, without directly handling students' property.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If students request assistance from ITS to repair a problem with their network connection, they may give ITS permission to enter the room and disconnect equipment for testing and troubleshooting in their absence. Similarly, Telephone Services personnel may enter student rooms in the residents' absence to effect repairs to voice telephone equipment or infrastructure. (See <a href=\"#notification\">Notification of Entry, below</a>.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Procedure for Entry in Emergency Situation</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Emergency Entry</span> <br>\nMiddlebury officials are authorized to enter a student's room without prior notice in emergency circumstances, such as a fire, fire alarm, fire drill, an immediate threat to health, safety or property, a call for help, or what reasonably seems to constitute an emergency situation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Special Room Inspection</span><br>\nIn addition to the circumstances described above, Middlebury officials may initiate entry of a room and/or a room search when there is reason to believe that a serious violation of Middlebury policy has been committed and/or the evidence may be found in a student's room. Searches of this nature will not be conducted without prior authorization of an appropriate senior Middlebury official. When possible, the student or students concerned and a witness shall be present when a room search is conducted. (See <a href=\"#notification\">Notification of Entry, below</a>.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Students living in Middlebury-owned housing have the right to be free from unlawful room searches conducted by law enforcement officials. In most instances, a lawful search must be conducted pursuant to a warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause. Middlebury officials must arrange with law enforcement authorities to obtain a search warrant before searching a student's room for evidence which they intend to turn over for purposes of criminal prosecution. If a police officer sees a student commit what reasonably appears to be a criminal offense or violation of local ordinances, however, Middlebury will not interfere with the officer's legal pursuit of the student into a dormitory and into a student room. Similarly, a Department of Public Safety officer who sees a student commit what reasonably appears to be a crime or a violation of Middlebury regulations has the right to pursue the student into a dormitory and into a student room.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><a name=\"notification\" id=\"notification\"></a>Notification of Entry</span><br>\nWhenever a student's dormitory room is entered by a Middlebury official to meet an emergency, to make a repair, to carry out a community service, to conduct a routine inspection, or to conduct an authorized search, a note will be left indicating the time, date, reason, and name of the Middlebury person or office responsible, unless the occupant of the room is present at the time of entry.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"housing\" id=\"housing\"></a>(d) Housing Regulations &#x26; Resources</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><a name=\"firesafety\" id=\"firesafety\"></a>Fire Safety Regulations</span></strong></p>\n<p>Any violation of fire safety regulations will result in a <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/support/sfs/sfs-handbook\">fine</a>.  Students found responsible will have to pay the additional cost(s) of repair or replacement of damaged equipment or property.  Students will be subject to disciplinary actions as well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Room entries, exits and hallways must be kept clear and free of potential obstructions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nothing may be hung from a sprinkler apparatus or sprinkler piping.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Only two walls of any room may be draped.

Tags with this information are required to be on each string of lights. LED string lights may not be placed over doorways, on ceilings or wrapped around any sprinkler piping, furniture or other cloth items such as curtains or wall hangings. LED lights may not be attached with nails or staples. LED lights must be plugged directly into an outlet or surge protector and may not be strung together.  If it cannot be verified that the lights are LED, the College has the right to remove them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Smoking is prohibited in all campus buildings, including the small residential houses. This includes porches, balconies, decks, or within 25 feet of any part of the building structure. E-cigarette smoking is also prohibited in campus buildings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The use of portable fire pits is prohibited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use of fire, or lighting a fire without an authorized fire permit, inside or outside of buildings, other than smoking in authorized outdoor spaces, is prohibited. The use of outdoor grills is limited to authorized locations at small houses and must be approved before use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Several College residence halls and lounges have working fireplaces. Before using a fireplace, permission is required from the Commons office associated with the residence.  Fires in fireplaces should never be unattended and there should always be a fire extinguisher present in the vicinity when there is any fire in the fireplace. The use of chemical fire starters is prohibited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tampering with fire- or life-safety equipment is prohibited and subject to fines. These charges will be borne collectively by the residence hall if the responsible individual(s) cannot be identified. “Fire- and life-safety equipment” includes fire alarms, fire doors, pull stations, extinguishers, hydrants, smoke detectors, smoke detector batteries, carbon monoxide detectors, and sprinklers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Students must exit a building when a fire alarm sounds; fines may be assessed for failure to do so.

The student body must uphold the Ordinance for the Regulation of Noise of the town of Middlebury. This ordinance prohibits excessive or unnecessary noise, including vocal disturbances and loud music, and punishes offenders with fines.  Students should neither cause nor condone excessive amounts of noise, but should strive to be considerate and respectful of others. Students are informed about Middlebury’s noise regulations by the residential life staff. Procedures on Noise Complaints can be found <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/Noise_Regulations\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Storage Regulations<br>\n</span></strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"></span></p>\n<p>Students leaving Middlebury College at any time during the academic year are responsible for packing their belongings and arranging for storage or shipping. Storage during the regular academic year for undergraduate Middlebury students:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Regular dormitory storage</em> (trunks, suitcases, boxed items).<br>\ni. Storage for some student belongings during the academic year is provided in some campus buildings. Interested students should consult with their resident assistant.<br>\nii. At the end of the school year, Facilities Services staff will clean out these storage areas and will dispose of any items not removed by students.</li>\n<li><em>House Storage</em><br>\nHouses may only store house items, such as pool tables and composites, in their houses over the summer recess. Personal items may not be left in the social houses. The president of each social house is responsible for supervising the storage area.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><a name=\"requesting\" id=\"requesting\"></a>(5) Requesting Changes or Off-Campus Housing</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Changing Housing Assignment</span></strong></p>\n<p>Students are assigned housing by the College through the room draw process. If students are experiencing a roommate conflict, they are highly encouraged to speak with their Residential Life staff or CRA before approaching the Commons dean or submitting a room-change request.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Procedure to Request Room Change</span></strong></p>\n<p>Mid-term room change requests may be submitted following the end of the second week of classes and will be considered in mid-October and mid-March.  Requests submitted during J-Term, and after the fall and spring deadlines will be considered on a case-by-case basis.   End of Term room change requests (fall and J-term) should be submitted to the residential systems coordinator by the assigned date.</p>\n<p>If a student is offered a mid-semester room change, the student has 48 hours to accept or reject the offer. If students have a double as a single for whatever reason, they must find an eligible roommate, or the residential systems coordinator will assign someone to fill the space. Students will always be encouraged to resolve any conflicts before considering a room change.</p>\n<p>As noted above, switching rooms and keys or changing residences without authorization is prohibited and subject to <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/office/student-financial-services/financial-tools-and-resources/student-financial-services-handbook\">fines</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Procedure to Request Off Campus Housing</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Off campus housing</strong><br>\nA limited number of releases are available for senior students to live off campus with prior approval from Residential Life. Students with special medical needs that necessitate a housing accommodation should address their concerns to Residential Life and the Student Accessibility Services. Students who are married or have dependent children living with them are exempted from the residency and board requirements upon providing documentation to Residential Life.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Procedure to Request Living Off-Campus</span></strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury permits a limited number of seniors to live off campus. Permission is granted by a process coordinated by the Office of the Dean of Students. Students with the status of \"special students\" are required to live off campus. The number of off-campus residents is based on our commitment to the residential experience and an evaluation of the rental market in the town of Middlebury. Off-Campus status requires the approval of the Commons dean. Approval may not be granted if a student has been subject to official College discipline or academic failure.  Students living off campus must provide their local address and phone number to Middlebury’s residential systems coordinator within the first five days of the term or the Off-Campus Fee Reduction will be forfeited.</p>\n<p>All Off-Campus forms must be turned in to the residential systems coordinator by the determined <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/office/residential-life/housing-overview\">deadlines</a>. Any student wishing to move off campus after the Off-Campus application deadline must notify the residential systems coordinator to be placed on a waiting list. Off-campus permission is granted through a random draw each term for the subsequent term. Applications are submitted electronically; students may apply as individuals or in groups up to three members.  Students who accept off-campus housing status are ineligible to participate in further fall term housing processes.</p>\n<p>Permission must be granted for each term a student wants to live off campus and an Off-Campus Fee Reduction Form must be submitted by the posted deadline.  A form submitted one term will not automatically transfer to the next term. Students living off campus for one term will be given priority to live off campus for the next term as long as there have been no disciplinary, academic or behavioral concerns raised during the previous term. Completing the form every term provides the Office of the Dean of Students with up-to-date residential information.</p>\n<p>Students who accept off-campus housing status and then request to move back on campus will be placed on a waiting list and housed by the residential systems coordinator following the completion of the housing processes taking place at that time.  There is no guarantee of housing for these students.</p>\n<p>Students who choose to live off-campus without authorization - that is, students who are not granted off-campus status but move off-campus nonetheless - will be subject to official discipline.</p>\n<p>Students who live off campus are expected to be good citizens. Students who violate Middlebury policy or local ordinances will be subject to Middleburydiscipline.</p>\n<p>Living on campus is considered to be an essential component of the educational experience at Middlebury. Request for off-campus housing on the basis of a medical or ADA-certified need will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will require appropriate documentation.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"termination\" id=\"termination\"></a>(6) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Termination of a House</span></strong></p>\n<p>The Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students (VPSA) will recommend to the President termination of a house at Middlebury in the following circumstances:</p>\n<p>a. for disciplinary reasons if there is an extraordinary violation by a house of Middlebury’s rules and regulations for students in houses.</p>\n<p>b.for disciplinary reasons if there are repeated violations by a house of Middlebury rules and regulations.  The VPSA may issue appropriate sanctions to a house for violations of rules and regulations. Sanctions may include disciplinary probation, which will involve the loss of the right to hold parties and of other privileges to be specified by the Office of the Dean of Students. The Dean of Students and/or the VPSA will report to the President persistent violations of guidelines and regulations by a  house on probation.</p>\n<p>c.  on the grounds of loss of student support and extraordinary expense to Middlebury if room occupancy of the house by members fails to meet the capacity requirements established by the Office of the Dean of Students and the IHC or dorm damages for the house exceed normal wear and tear.</p>\n<p>d. The President may seek input from appropriate bodies, such as the Community Council. The President is not required to consult other offices or bodies, however, and reserves the right to take whatever action is necessary, including immediate, indefinite suspension of the house or termination of the house. Indefinite suspension shall mean suspension of the house as a social organization at Middlebury, including loss of the right of members to reside in the house.</p>"},"b9537a80-77cb-5d5d-aea4-a8dd84ecde29":{"id":"b9537a80-77cb-5d5d-aea4-a8dd84ecde29","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/student-organization-policies","title":"B.2.h.

All recognized student organizations must register annually with the Office of the Dean of Students (DOS) and have constitutions that have been approved by the Constitution Committee of the Student Government Association (SGA). The Constitution Committee may not approve a constitution with provisions that are in violation of federal, state, or local laws, or Middlebury policy.\n3.  All recognized student organizations must have an adviser who is a current, full-time Middlebury faculty or staff member or contract Middlebury employee. An adviser may inform an organization about its legal responsibilities and make appropriate suggestions about policy, but does not have authority to control policy or make personnel or financial decisions.\n4.  Student organizations are financed, in whole or in part, by the Student Activities Fee, which all students must pay in order to register for each term.\n5.  Approval of a constitution does not guarantee funding. The Finance Committee of the SGA administers funding of student organizations by allocating the Student Activities Fee. This fee is separate from the comprehensive fee and is not a part of Middlebury’s general budget. However, as these funds are collected by Middlebury for the general student body, Middlebury maintains oversight of expenditures and allocations. Student activities funds may not be used for direct political action or for disbursement to any organization that is not an officially recognized Middlebury organization.\n6.  Recognized student organizations have the right to schedule the use of Middlebury facilities, use the Middlebury name and logo in reference to their group, and be eligible for programs and services through the Office of the Dean of Students (DOS). A complete listing of student organization rights and responsibilities may be found in the DOS office.\n7.  The DOS or appropriate designee may suspend or revoke any organization's registration, affiliated members, advisors and/or coaches at any time, in its sole discretion, for any abuse or violation of the outlined rights and responsibilities, or any reasonable cause deemed to be in the best interest of the organization or Middlebury.\n8.  Middlebury assumes that individual students are responsible and accountable for their own behavior, and that groups of students and student organizations are responsible for their collective behavior. Failure to comply with Middlebury policy may result in disciplinary action against an individual or group. Serious violations of the policy may result in a suspension of the groups for up to one year; and repeated infractions may lead to additional penalties.\n\n**<a name=\"discrimination\" id=\"discrimination\"></a>Discrimination**\n\n1.  No student organization may discriminate in its membership, leadership, programs, or activities on the basis of  race, creed, color, place of birth, ancestry, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, service in the armed forces of the United States, positive HIV-related blood test results, genetic information, or against qualified individuals with disabilities on the basis of disability and/or any other status or characteristic as defined and to the extent protected by applicable law. (For further information, please see Middlebury’s [Nondiscrimination Statement](/pages/i-policies-for-all/genl-principles/non-discrimination-statement) and [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin) policy).\n2.  Discrimination on the basis of any of the aforementioned qualities or characteristics is antithetical to Middlebury's mission and is unlawful.\n3.  Middlebury recognizes the long-standing importance of religious belief and practice in American society, and the diversity of religious belief and practice within the Middlebury community. Students and student organizations may pursue their own religious beliefs, and the articulation of those beliefs, through religious practice and community life. When allegations arise that those beliefs and practices have resulted in actions that discriminate against an individual or group, the procedure outlined in paragraph 6 below should be followed.\n4.  A student organization may require candidates for leadership positions or offices to fulfill certain prerequisites prior to election or selection, and may restrict leadership roles and voting to those members with demonstrated prior affiliation with the organization. Such procedures, including all prerequisites, restrictions, and nomination requirements, must be consistent with Middlebury policies, including Middlebury's [Nondiscrimination Statement](/pages/i-policies-for-all/genl-principles/non-discrimination-statement) and the [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin), and must be stated in detail in the organization's constitution.\n5.  An organization may express in its constitution ideals or preferences regarding beliefs its leaders might hold. No student may be precluded from being on a ballot or participating in a selection process on the basis of any of the qualities or characteristics referred to in paragraph 1 above.\n6.  Students alleging discrimination by an individual or a group on the basis of the aforementioned qualities or characteristics may submit a complaint in accordance with the procedures outlined in Middlebury's [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin).\n\n**<a name=\"association\" id=\"association\"></a>Freedom of Association**\n\nStudents bring a variety of previously acquired interests  to Middlebury, and they develop many new interests as members of the academic community. They should be free to organize and join associations to promote their common interests.\n\n1.  In order to ensure the integrity of recognized student organizations as Middlebury student activities, the membership, policies, and actions of a student organization will be determined by vote of only those persons who hold bona fide membership in the Middlebury community.\n2.  Affiliation with an external organization does not automatically disqualify a student organization from institutional recognition, but College policy specifically prohibits student participation in or affiliation with single-gender fraternities or sororities.\n3.  Students are free to organize informally for any legal aim, subject to Middlebury's rules and regulations. If they seek official Middlebury recognition that makes them eligible for student activities funds and other student organization privileges as outlined in the Rights and Responsibilities, they must have a written constitution formally approved by the SGA Constitution Committee and be registered annually with the DOS.\n\n**<a name=\"inquiry\" id=\"inquiry\"></a>Freedom of Inquiry and Expression**\n\nIn addition to the policies below, please see [Demonstrations and Protests](/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/demonst-protests) Policy.\n\n1.  Students and student organizations are free to examine and discuss all questions of interest to them and to express opinions publicly and privately. They should always be free to support causes by orderly means which do not disrupt Middlebury's or the community's regular and essential operation. At the same time, it should be made clear to the academic and larger community that students or student organizations speak only for themselves in their public expressions or demonstrations.\n2.  Officially recognized student organizations may invite to the campus and hear any person of their choosing. Middlebury reserves the right to ensure orderly scheduling of facilities, which prevents unnecessary conflict with other Middlebury events and provides adequate preparation for the event. It should be made clear to the academic and larger community that sponsorship of guest speakers does not necessarily imply approval or endorsement of the views expressed, either by the sponsoring group or Middlebury.\n3.  Student organizations bear full responsibility for arranging and financing any Department of Public Safety services that may be necessary in connection with controversial speakers. The DOS has the right to receive full and accurate information regarding Department of Public Safety measures at any time they so request. The DOS also has the right to specify security measures to the organizations as seem appropriate. If Middlebury, through the DOS or the president, judges that security arrangements are inadequate and that the sponsoring organization is either unwilling or unable to make proper arrangements, the event may be canceled by the dean or president.\n\n**<a name=\"publications\" id=\"publications\"></a>Student Publications and Media**\n\nStudent media groups (publications, radio and newspaper) are a valuable aid in establishing and maintaining an atmosphere of free and responsible discussion and of intellectual exploration on the campus. They are a means of bringing student concerns to the attention of the faculty and College authorities and of formulating student opinion on various issues on the campus and in the world at large.\n\nStudent media groups are financed by the Student Activities Fee, which all students must pay in order to register for each term. There is no set limit to the number of publications or other media produced each year, and the SGA has final jurisdiction in this matter. Despite the financial dependence of student publications, Middlebury, the SGA, and the Community Council must provide sufficient editorial freedom and financial autonomy for the student media groups to maintain their integrity of purpose as vehicles of free inquiry and free expression in an academic community.  \nThe editorial freedom of student editors and managers entails the corollary responsibility to abide by the canons of responsible journalism, including the avoidance of libel, indecency, undocumented allegations, attacks on personal integrity, and the use of harassment and innuendo, as defined by Middlebury's [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin).\n\nThe constitutions of student media groups must provide clear statements of general policy and the nature of their responsibility to the student body at large.\n\nAs safeguards for the editorial freedom of student publications the following provisions are set forth:\n\n1.  The student press will be free of censorship and advance approval of copy, and its editors and managers are free to develop their own editorial policies and news coverage.\n2.  All student media groups financed and published by the College must include a clear statement on the editorial page that opinions expressed in the publication are not necessarily those of the College or the student body.\n3.  Advertisements in publications may not include references to alcohol, drugs, or drug paraphernalia, directly or indirectly.\n\nThe SGA Senate has the power to remove an incumbent editor or manager by a two-thirds vote, in accordance with the procedures outlined below, but the SGA must ensure that editors and managers of student media groups are not arbitrarily suspended or removed because of student, faculty, administrative, or public disapproval of editorial policy or content. Suspension or removal must be premised upon a finding of violation of the canons of responsible journalism or failure to appear at removal proceedings as described below.\n\n1.  A charge against an editor or manager may be filed only by a person aggrieved by the alleged offense. The charge must be stated in detail, and presented in writing to the president of the SGA within ten business days of publication or broadcast of the offending material. The president will present the charges to the SGA Senate. Should the aggrieved party be the president of the SGA, the Student Co-Chair of Community Council will bring charges to the SGA Senate. Should both parties be aggrieved, the Speaker of the Senate will bring the charges.\n2.  Upon receipt of the written charges, the SGA Senate will determine by majority vote whether to initiate removal proceedings against the editor or manager charged. Removal proceedings may commence no earlier than three business days after the vote to initiate the proceedings.\n3.  The editor or manager charged, the aggrieved party, and the student staff member who wrote or broadcast the offending material must be present at the removal hearing. The president of the SGA will give notice to all parties of the time and place of hearing. Witnesses may be called by either side to support or refute the charges, or to determine the extent to which the editor or manager charged is responsible for the alleged offense.\n4.  At the commencement of the hearing, the editor or manager charged and the aggrieved party will each be allowed no more than 15 minutes to make an oral presentation before the SGA. Written defenses or allegations may be distributed to SGA members by either side at any time after the initiation of removal proceedings. Each side will be allowed access to all materials so disseminated. After the oral presentations, questioning will be allowed. The president of the SGA presides over the hearing and is responsible for keeping order.\n5.  A vote to remove must be taken within fifteen business days of the vote to initiate removal proceedings. An editor or manager who has been removed by the required two-thirds vote may not serve for the remainder of the academic year as an editor or manager of the organization from which he or she was removed.\n6.  If an editor or manager is removed under these procedures, the organization that originally published or broadcast the offending statement must publicly retract it.\n\n**<a name=\"provisions\" id=\"provisions\"></a>General Provisions for Recognized Student Organizations**\n\nMiddlebury, through the DOS and the president, retains the right and ultimate authority to protect itself from criminal or civil action that could be taken against Middlebury because of the conduct of a student organization. When Middlebury has a reasonable basis to believe  that a forthcoming activity of an organization carries with it the possibility of legal action, Middlebury may cancel the activity or request the organization to make appropriate changes in its plans.\n\n**<a name=\"social_orgs\" id=\"social_orgs\"></a>Policy on Student Social Organizations**\n\nA student social organization is an organization, whether located on or off campus, comprised primarily or exclusively of Middlebury students, that has some of the purposes or attributes of a fraternity, sorority, or social house. This does not imply that Middlebury authorizes, sponsors, or extends recognition to any off-campus student organization. Because fraternities and sororities are traditionally defined as single-sex organizations, and thus exclude certain students based on their gender, they are not permitted at Middlebury. Ties with any national organization whose rules or practices are at odds with Middlebury’s non-discrimination policies should not be maintained. Please see Middlebury’s [Nondiscrimination Statement](/pages/i-policies-for-all/genl-principles/non-discrimination-statement) for more information.\n\nMiddlebury assumes that individual students are responsible and accountable for their own behavior and that groups of students are responsible and accountable for their collective behavior. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action against an individual or a group.\n\n**<a name=\"posting\" id=\"posting\"></a>Posting**\n\nPosters are permitted on designated bulletin boards or kiosks only.  Flyers may not be posted on doors, walls, windows, buildings, lamp posts, trees, or stairwells. Flyers found in these locations will be removed by Middlebury staff. Fines and/or disciplinary action may result from violations.\n\n**<a name=\"fundraising\" id=\"fundraising\"></a>Student Fundraising Policies and Regulations**\n\nThe DOS gives approval to students and student organizations to raise money for charitable projects or to raise funds on campus to defray costs of a limited number of special Middlebury-approved projects.\n\n1.  Students organizing fundraising activities must obtain permission for their activity from the DOS.\n2.  When a fundraising activity involves setup, table, or booth, permission for the setup must be obtained from DOS. If the requested site involves another department, then the director of that department must also provide permission for the activity to occur there (e.g., the director of athletics must also approve requests for activities at football games and other athletic events). The DOS and the supervisor of the site will decide whether or not one or more activities may occur simultaneously at the same location.\n3.  Profits accumulated through fundraising activities by any organization that received student activities fees may be used for any purpose subject to the following restrictions:\n\ni. The purpose of the organization's fund-raising must be clearly advertised in advance.  \nii. The organization may not initiate any activity, the profits of which will be used for any direct or indirect contributions to a political campaign.  \niii. The fundraising must conform to the SGA Finance Committee guidelines.  \niv. When revenue is generated by a student organization from an activity that was approved by the SGA Finance Committee and uses Student Activities Fee (SAF) money, all proceeds from the activity must be deposited to the organization’s Middlebury account. Any SAF money spent on the activity must be spent according to Finance Committee Guidelines. Proceeds net of SAF funds may be spent at the organization’s discretion within the policies of Middlebury and the organization’s constitution. Exceptions to this rule may be considered by the SGA Finance Committee.\n\n_Off-campus_\n\n1.  Students are not allowed to solicit donations or gifts from local merchants.\n2.  Under certain circumstances the DOS will approve fundraising efforts that occur off campus.\n3.  Students wishing to conduct fundraising off-campus must familiarize themselves with and abide by all applicable Middlebury policies in addition to all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\n\n_Solicitation_\n\n1.  Direct solicitation for fundraising via campus mail or e-mail is prohibited.\n2.  Middlebury directories may never be used for the purpose of solicitation.\n3.  Door-to-door solicitation in residence halls is prohibited. In addition, the solicitation of faculty and staff in their campus offices is prohibited. Door-to-door solicitation is also prohibited off campus.\n4.  Unattended coin and cash collection jars are not permitted.\n5.  Students and student groups may not solicit funds or sales from parents or alumni.\n\n_Raising Funds for Charity_\n\n1.  Students may be approved to raise funds for off-campus charities (e.g. the American Red Cross).\n2.  Organizations wishing to make donations to charitable organizations may use the proceeds from certain activities (see above). SAF funds cannot be used for donations.\n3.  Organizations may collect funds through cash, debit cards, credit cards, or checks made out to Middlebury College. Checks may also be made out directly to the charity.\n4.  Organizations may not raise funds for political campaigns.\n\n_Sale and Distribution of Food on Campus_\n\nRecognized student organizations may distribute food in designated locations, as well as outdoor events, provided they have received prior approval from the DOS and the director of Dining Services.\n\n**<a name=\"vendors\" id=\"vendors\"></a>Student Vendors**\n\nMiddlebury may, at its discretion, approve selected student entrepreneurial activities to function on campus. These student-run businesses involve the sale of a product or service solely for students at Middlebury.\n\nAny Middlebury student desiring to conduct a student business on the Middlebury campus must first register and obtain approval from the [Business Services Office](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/administration/vpfin/finance-office/our-team/business-services-office). The approval process may be commenced by completing the \"Student Vendor Authorization & Contract\" form and submitting it to the director of Business Services. Student business applicants should be prepared to provide additional information about their business operation and plan and, if necessary, to meet with Business Services personnel before receiving approval to commence operations.\n\nThis policy applies not only to business activities designed and originated by Middlebury College students but also to businesses operated by off-campus entities which recruit Middlebury students to carry on business activity on their behalf on the Middlebury campus. Such \"franchise\" operations must comply with the parameters and process of the \"Student Vendor Authorization & Contract\" or will otherwise be deemed to be in violation of this policy.\n\nFailure to obtain approval before conducting a student business on campus or acting as a franchise agent may result in disciplinary action.\n\nMiddlebury is not responsible in any part for the functions, sales, taxes, or operations of student businesses.\n\n1.  Permission for Student Vendors will be granted only to current students. Permission is granted through the Business Services Office.\n2.  Student Vendors must negotiate a contract with Middlebury that describes the services that will be provided, the points of impact that may require Middlebury staff assistance, and a confirmation that all appropriate insurance, tax, licensing, and compensation provisions have been established.\n3.  Contract terms are required to be renegotiated annually.\n4.  Contracts may be canceled by the College at any time should Middlebury determine that the contract provisions have been violated.\n5.  Once a Student Vendor has been approved, it will be allowed to function within the confines of the Middlebury campus and must abide by all Middlebury rules and regulations – as well as the stipulations detailed in its contract with Middlebury.\n6.  When the sale of a product or service involves setup, table, or booth, permission for the setup must be obtained from the Department of Event Management.  If the requested sale site involves another department, then the director of that department must also provide permission for the sales to occur there (e.g., the director of athletics must also approve requests for sales at football games and other athletic events). The DOS and the supervisor of the sale site will decide whether or not one or more activities may occur simultaneously at the same location.\n7.  Student Vendors are required to pay for all Middlebury services that are requested. These charges include but are not limited to: the collection and distribution of keys, the loss of a key and the re-coring of locks, delivery and set up of tables, etc. It is the responsibility of the student business to request information about potential costs of services before services are provided. Failure to request information about a potential cost will not absolve the Student Vendor from being responsible for the costs.\n8.  Damage to Middlebury property is the responsibility of the student business. The student or students named in the contract will be billed. Damage to property may result in the cancellation of the student business contract.\n","excerpt":"1.       General 2.       Discrimination 3.       Freedom of Association 4.       Freedom of Inquiry and Expression 5.       General…","html":"<p>1.       <a href=\"#general\">General</a></p>\n<p>2.       <a href=\"#discrimination\">Discrimination</a></p>\n<p>3.       <a href=\"#association\">Freedom of Association</a></p>\n<p>4.       <a href=\"#inquiry\">Freedom of Inquiry and Expression</a></p>\n<p>5.       <a href=\"#provisions\">General Provisions for Recognized Student Organizations</a></p>\n<p>6.       <a href=\"#publications\">Student Publications and Media</a></p>\n<p>7.       <a href=\"#social_orgs\">Policy on Student Social Organizations</a></p>\n<p>8.       <a href=\"#posting\">Posting</a><a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/about/college-handbook-2017-revision/II.-policies-for-the-undergraduate-college/policies-for-undergrads/res-life-conduct-policies/student-organization-policies/node/552731/edit?destination=mm/719408#posting\"></a></p>\n<p>9.       <a href=\"#fundraising\">Student Fundraising Policies</a></p>\n<p>10.     <a href=\"#vendors\">Student Vendors</a></p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"general\" id=\"general\"></a>General</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>All student organizations are subject to Middlebury policies, including but not limited to the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin\">Anti-Harassment/Discrimination</a> and <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/hazing-policy\">Hazing</a> policies.</li>\n<li>All recognized student organizations must register annually with the Office of the Dean of Students (DOS) and have constitutions that have been approved by the Constitution Committee of the Student Government Association (SGA).

This fee is separate from the comprehensive fee and is not a part of Middlebury’s general budget.

Time spent on leave does not count towards this exemption period. The exemption period will be automatically applied unless the faculty member requests to remain eligible for such service in the year(s) following their committee service. Members of the faculty will not be obligated to serve for more than a total of twelve (12) years on any combination of these committees or former versions of them, including the Committee on Reappointment, Teaching Resources Committee, and the Educational Council.\n\nAny faculty member may request to be exempted from the ballots for elected committees and from selection for standing appointed committees, on an annual basis, for a period of time not to exceed four years in a career.

It may recommend to the faculty the reconstruction or abolition of committees. In this function, the Council’s actions are subject to ratification by the faculty.\n\n**b. *Composition***\n\ni. The council will consist of four tenured faculty members, two pre-tenure (i.e., nontenured regular appointment) faculty members, and one special appointment faculty member. Tenured and pre-tenure faculty must have completed two years of full-time faculty status at Middlebury before his or her elected term begins.

If the vacancies are of different lengths, the longest vacancy will be decided by the first round of election, and shorter vacancies by subsequent rounds of election.\n\nIn the event of a tie vote on the preliminary ballot of any election, the names of candidates who received the five highest vote totals will be included on the second ballot.  On the second ballot of any election, in the event of a tie among three or more candidates for first place, a runoff ballot will be issued, listing the names of the tied candidates.  Faculty members may vote for one candidate on the runoff ballot.  The names of the two candidates who received the greatest number of votes on the runoff ballot will appear on the final ballot.  On the second ballot of any election, in the event of a tie among two or more candidates for second place, a runoff ballot will be issued, listing the names of the tied candidates.  Faculty members may vote for one candidate on the runoff ballot.  The name of the candidate who received the greatest number of votes on the runoff ballot will appear on the final ballot, along with the name of the candidate who received the greatest number of votes on the second ballot.\n\n**<a name=\"eac\" id=\"eac\"></a>3\\. Educational Affairs Committee (EAC)**\n\n**a. *Function***\n\nThe Educational Affairs Committee has two functions of equal importance: (1) to oversee the general direction of the College curriculum and (2) to make recommendations on staffing and the allocation of teaching resources. The EAC considers proposals for new majors, standalone minors\\*, and programs, changes in degree requirements and the College academic calendar, and other matters of general educational policy, and refers the proposals it approves to the full faculty for further action. The Committee considers proposals for new and restored positions on the faculty and for replacement staffing for faculty on leave, and recommends the proposals it approves to the provost or the provost’s designate. The committee's purpose is to provide guidance and direction to the manner in which resources are allocated to carry out Middlebury's educational mission as a liberal arts college.\n\n\\*A standalone minor is defined as any minor for which there is no corresponding major.\n\n**b. *Composition***\n\ni. The EAC will be composed of seven members: five elected, full-time, tenured members of the faculty; and two academic administrators appointed by the provost, one of whom will chair the committee. The faculty members of the EAC will elect one of their members to serve as a co-chair, alongside the administrative co-chair. When voting is necessary, only the elected faculty members shall vote, except in the case of a tie, when the chair will cast a deciding vote.\n\nii. The faculty co-chair will run meetings, set meeting agendas (in consultation with the administrative co-chair and other EAC members), report to the faculty at plenary sessions, and coordinate work with other committee chairs as needed. The administrative co-chair will coordinate the staffing proposal review process, convey EAC staffing recommendations to the provost, and communicate outcomes resulting from deliberations of the EAC. The faculty and administrative co-chairs together will write reports for the EAC.\n\niii. In carrying out its functions, the EAC will create, as it deems necessary, ad hoc committees to obtain information and recommendations about particular issues. The composition of such ad hoc committees will be at the discretion of the EAC, except that ad hoc committees on matters of general educational policy or academic regulations will always include at least one student member.\n\niv. The Student Government Association will be responsible for the appointment of four student representatives to serve as members of a Student Educational Affairs Committee (SEAC). The SEAC will invite one faculty member of the EAC to serve in an advisory capacity. The EAC will meet with the SEAC at least once a month to discuss matters of general educational policy. The EAC will consult with the SEAC prior to presenting proposals that require approval of the full faculty, such as proposals for new majors, standalone minors, and programs, changes in degree requirements and the College academic calendar, and other matters of general educational policy. The SEAC may initiate proposals for consideration by the EAC. The members of the SEAC are permitted to attend monthly faculty meetings, with the right to speak during consideration of curricular measures presented by the Educational Affairs Committee.\n\n**c. *Election***\n\ni. The five elected members of the Educational Affairs Committee will be elected at large by all voting members of the faculty.

Standing Committees**\n\nThe various standing committees will keep the Educational Affairs Committee informed of their activities through minutes of all their meetings. In a given year the EAC may also decide to concentrate its attention on the issues arising before a particular standing committee: at the EAC's request, one of its members may be named to sit on such a committee and to serve as a liaison between the two groups. The standing committees include:\n\n_i. Curriculum Committee_\n\n(a) *Composition*: the dean of curriculum, who is chair, four faculty members from different divisions, and two student members, elected by the Student Government Association.\n\n(b) *Function:* To approve or reject requests for additions, deletions, or alterations of courses that have been recommended by the appropriate divisions/departments; to act upon proposed changes in requirements for existing programs, majors, and minors; to exercise general oversight of the distribution requirement and the cultures and civilizations requirement; to exercise general oversight of the first-year seminar program; to undertake responsibility for the administration of an effective and well-balanced winter term program; to approve, in consultation with the dean of the College or designee, proposals from students for Independent Scholar status. The divisions may propose to the Curriculum Committee that certain courses be given divisional designations rather than departmental letters. Such proposals require prior consent of the instructor's department and the division in which the course is to be offered.\n\n(c) *Procedure:*\n\n(1) Proposals for the addition of courses to the curriculum must be presented to the Curriculum Committee for approval.

Policies overseen by the Administration Committee include but are not limited to the following:\n\n- course drops after the deadline for exceptional personal circumstances;\n- reduced course load for exceptional personal circumstances;\n- invocation of Pass/D/Fail status after the deadline for exceptional personal circumstances;\n- requests for readmission after academic failure or conduct-related suspension;\n- reinstatement for the purpose of credit transfer toward the Middlebury degree;\n- exceptions allowing retaking of courses for which credit was earned;\n- waivers of residence requirements for first-year Winter Term or senior year for non-medical reasons;\n- grade change requests from faculty members.\n\nThe Office of the Registrar may forward to the Administration Committee unusual or unprecedented petitions that fall within the office’s scope of responsibility for which the Registrar requests a Committee decision.\n\nThe Administration Committee is composed of two co-chairs, generally a dean from the Dean of Students Office and a returning faculty member; three faculty members from across the academic divisions; and the registrar and associate registrar. Only the members of the faculty and dean serve as voting members.\n\nMiddlebury’s academic policies embody the expectations that students are enrolled at Middlebury to pursue their academic degree; that they must adhere responsibly to the policies that support this goal; and that if factors arise that interfere with this goal, they will address them responsibly and/or seek help from Middlebury or external resources in a timely fashion. When evaluating petitions requesting exceptions to these policies, the Committee generally considers the following:\n\n- the goals of the relevant policies;\n- the responsibilities of students and of the institution;\n- the principles of fairness to the petitioner and of fairness to all other affected parties;\n- the individual circumstances of the petitioner.\n\nPetitions may be approved, tabled, or denied. Petitions are tabled when the Committee identifies additional information needed for the evaluation; upon its receipt, the Committee resumes consideration. In cases of denial, petitioners who wish to provide relevant new or clarifying information may resubmit their petition to the Administration Committee for reconsideration.\n\nProcedures for submitting a petition may be found on the [Administration Committee website](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/academic-life/Administration-Committee).\n\niii. _Athletic Policy Committee_\n\nThe committee has the responsibility to formulate and recommend to the faculty policy concerning intercollegiate athletics for Middlebury College undergraduates, in accordance with the rules of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), and the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), in which Middlebury maintains membership. The committee acts as an executive committee. Its decisions are subject to review at the following faculty meeting through approval of the minutes of its meeting. As an executive committee, the committee has the following responsibilities: (a) approving all athletic schedules within the limits established by the faculty; (b) approving the number of classes missed for a particular event; (c) making exceptions to established faculty athletic policy; and (d) obtaining financial authorization from the administration prior to taking executive action or recommending action by the faculty.

Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (CDEI)**\n\n**a. Function**\n\nThe Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is the primary faculty governance body addressing institutional and social diversity in the broadest sense, serving as an independent advocacy group, advisory body, and faculty network for exchange and support of ideas and policies. The committee consults and meets, at least once per academic year, with different entities such as the Senior Leadership Group, the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, the Strategy and Resources Committees, the Alliance for an Inclusive Middlebury, the Admissions Office, the Educational Affairs Committee and its subcommittees (in particular, the Curriculum Committee and Administration Committee). Its activities take two forms: reaching out to the relevant parts of the College to address issues raised among the faculty, and being a resource for various parts of the College to consult for a faculty perspective on diversity. It works to strengthen Middlebury’s commitment to the ideals, practices, and policies with which we collectively seek equity and inclusion across the institution by working with and through other institutional governance structures to provide recommendations that support students, staff and faculty work toward these goals. The committee's areas of attention may include but are not limited to the following:\n\n1)  Faculty Leadership\n\nThe CDEI represents faculty perspectives on diversity policies and practices, and serves as the institutional connection between the administration and the faculty on issues of diversity, inclusion, and equity. It advocates for opportunities for all faculty members to learn more strategies to address these issues in their teaching, promote a culture of inclusivity, and enhance our potential for institutional transformation. The CDEI meets with the Provost at least once each semester, and with other members of the Senior Leadership Group as necessary. The CDEI also works with the Student Government Association and other relevant student groups (such as the Black Student Union, Women of Color, and Distinguished Men of Color) to ensure open and productive communication between students and faculty around issues pertaining to diversity at Middlebury.\n\n2)  Policy Brokerage\n\nThe CDEI compiles and expresses faculty concerns and suggestions for transforming Middlebury’s status quo. It serves both as a sounding board for the administration to workshop its ideas for policy changes, and as a loudspeaker for faculty ideas. This brokerage function is particularly important for junior faculty with concerns and good ideas, who may be cautious about asserting themselves while working their way toward tenure.\n\n3)  Communication and Reporting\n\nThe CDEI occasionally reports on its activities at faculty meetings, in addition to setting an agenda of targets and goals at the beginning of each academic year. It also responds to faculty questions and initiatives relating to issues of racism, diversity, and inclusion as these emerge from these meetings and the other mechanisms of faculty governance. At the end of each academic year, the CDEI will submit a brief report to the faculty on its deliberations and actions, and identify issues for consideration the following year. This report will be included in the minutes of the last plenary session of the faculty.\n\n4)  Outreach\n\nThe CDEI annually engages the College faculty in a discussion of issues of race, diversity, and inclusion, especially as they relate to the College, and solicit faculty input regarding them. Pragmatically, this may take the form of an annual Summit on Diversity and Inclusion. The committee may also sponsor reading groups or lectures on topics related to issues in higher education that warrant consideration by the faculty. It can also keep records, numbers, and data about diversity issues in a centralized and public space, open to all faculty. This resource will solidify our institutional memory and support curricular and institutional innovations.\n\n**b. Composition**\n\nThe CDEI will consist of six faculty members, with the Chief Diversity Officer serving as an ex officio member and attending its meetings at the committee’s invitation. The committee should reflect the diversity that Middlebury seeks to achieve. No more than two CDEI members shall be junior faculty. Faculty Council will be responsible for inviting and appointing some members of this committee, with the expectation that the procedure would maintain the CDEI’s autonomy in relation to rest of the College’s administration and governance structure. It will meet at least once per month, and more often as necessary.\n\nMembership on the CDEI is open to all tenured faculty members, all pre-tenure faculty members on regular appointment, and all faculty members on special appointment who have contracts extending for at least one year beyond the date of the start of the term to which they would be elected or appointed. A member of the CDEI must have completed two years of full-time faculty status at Middlebury before their term begins. A member of the CDEI may not simultaneously serve on the Council on Reviews, Faculty Council, Educational Affairs Committee, Strategy Committee, Resources Committee, or Appeals Council. No more than two members of the CDEI may be from one division and no more than one member may be from one department. The departmental affiliation of the Chief Diversity Officer will not figure into the distribution of members.\n\nThe term for members of the CDEI is three years. Two of the positions will be elected by the faculty. The remaining four positions will be appointed by the Faculty Council in its role as the Committee on Committees. Faculty Council should consider ways to ensure that the CDEI membership includes interest in, expertise about, and community support on diversity issues. It could, for example, require that one of the Faculty Council-appointed positions be from an academic department that directly addresses diversity issues. It could create a student nomination process for another of these positions.\n\nElections and appointments will normally be for three-year terms. Positions that become vacant due to leaves, retirements, or for other reasons will be filled in the same way that the departing member was first selected for the committee: vacancies in elected positions will be filled by election, and vacancies in appointed positions will be filled by appointment.\n\nThe CDEI will elect one of its own tenured members as chair. The chair will run meetings, set meeting agendas, write reports, report to the faculty at plenary meetings, and coordinate work with other committee chairs as needed.\n\n**c. *Election***\n\nFor election for the CDEI, a preliminary ballot will include a list of all eligible tenured members, all eligible pre-tenured faculty members on regular appointment, and all eligible faculty members on special appointment who have contracts extending for at least one year beyond the date of start of the term to which they would be electedFaculty members already serving on Council on Reviews, Faculty Council, Educational Affairs Committee, Strategy Committee, Resources Committee, those who will be on leave during the following year, and those made ineligible or whose obligation is waived because of stipulations set forth above are ineligible for election.  On the preliminary ballot, faculty members may vote for up to five candidates. Following the preliminary ballot, a second ballot will be distributed, listing the names of the five candidates who received the greatest number of votes on the preliminary ballot. Faculty members may vote for up to two candidates on the second ballot. After the second round of voting, a final ballot will be distributed, listing the two candidates who received the greatest number of votes on the second ballot. Faculty members may vote for one candidate on the final ballot. The candidate with the greatest number of votes will be declared elected.\n\nIf there is a second vacancy on the CDEI to be filled by election in a given year, the election procedure as described above will be repeated. If the vacancies are of different lengths, the longest vacancy will be decided by the first round of election, and shorter vacancyby subsequent rounds of election.\n\nIn the event of a tie vote on the preliminary ballot of any election, the names of candidates who received the five highest vote totals will be included on the second ballot. On the second ballot of any election, in the event of a tie among three or more candidates for first place, a runoff ballot will be issued, listing the names of the tied candidates. Faculty members may vote for one candidate on the runoff ballot. The names of the two candidates who received the greatest number of votes on the runoff ballot will appear on the final ballot. On the second ballot of any election, in the event of a tie among two or more candidates for second place, a runoff ballot will be issued, listing the names of the tied candidates. Faculty members may vote for one candidate on the runoff ballot. The name of the candidate who received the greatest number of votes on the runoff ballot will appear on the final ballot, along with the name of the candidate who received the greatest number of votes on the second ballot.\n\n**d. Procedures**\n\nIn carrying out its functions, the CDEI may create *ad hoc* committees comprised of other faculty (and, as necessary, staff members and students) as needed.  The procedures for seeking approval of CDEI initiatives will be dictated by the nature of the initiative, but will follow existing channels for review as appropriate, including but not limited to the SGA, Community Council, Faculty Council, Educational Affairs Committee, and full faculty vote.\n\n**<a name=\"strategy\" id=\"strategy\"></a>5\\. The Strategy Committee**\n\n**a. *Function***\n\nThe Strategy Committee represents the College faculty in long-range strategic planning with the administration and the Board of Trustees. Though the committee is concerned primarily with the College, it will also represent the faculty in shared-governance discussions on matters of common interest to the College, the Schools, and the Institute. The committee is also charged with engaging the faculty, administration, and trustees on developments in higher education (both nationally and globally), as they might affect Middlebury College. In fulfilling this charge, the Strategy Committee will:\n\n1\\. Work closely with the provost to develop and monitor long-range strategic planning especially as it relates to the integrity of Middlebury College and possible collaborations among it, the Schools, and the Institute.\n\n2\\. Meet each fall and spring term, and at other times as necessary, with the Resources Committee to review Middlebury’s finances as they relate to current and long-range priorities involving the College’s mission.

Contribute to the development of strategic plans initiated by the administration or the Board of Trustees. The committee will work with any ad hoc planning committee appointed by the administration or the Board, either through the appointment of one or more members of the Strategy Committee to the ad hoc planning committee, or through active consultation with the ad hoc planning committee.\n\n8\\. At the end of each academic year submit a brief report to the faculty on its deliberations and actions, and identify issues for consideration the following year. This report will be included in the minutes of the last plenary session of the faculty.\n\n**b. *Composition***\n\ni. The Strategy Committee will consist of four faculty members.

On the preliminary ballot, faculty members may vote for as many candidates as they like.\n\nThe candidate who receives the greatest number of votes on the preliminary ballot will be declared elected, provided that he or she obtains the support of 50% or more of the voters who cast ballots.  For any further vacancy, the eligible candidate who receives the next greatest number of votes on the preliminary ballot will be declared elected, provided that he or she obtains the support of 50% or more of the voters who cast ballots.  If the vacancies are of different lengths, the longest vacancy will be filled by the candidate who receives the greatest number of votes, and shorter vacancies by eligible candidates who receive the next greatest number of votes.\n\nFor any vacancy, if no eligible candidate obtains support from 50% or more of the voters who participated in the preliminary ballot, a second ballot will be distributed listing the two eligible candidates who received the greatest number of votes on the preliminary ballot.  Faculty members may vote for one candidate on this ballot.  The candidate with the greatest number of votes will be declared elected.\n\nIn the event of a tie vote on the preliminary ballot of any election, the names of candidates who received the two highest vote totals will be included on the second ballot.  If no candidate on the second ballot receives more than 50% of the votes cast, the names of the two candidates who received the greatest number of votes will appear on a final ballot.\n\n**c. _Formation of an Appeal Committee_**\n\nWhen an appeal is to be heard, the Appeals Council will form an Appeal Committee, choosing its chair and two other members by rotation from the Appeals Council. In no case will a member of an Appeal Committee be a member of the appellant's department. In the event of an appeal resulting from a negative Physical Education and Athletics Committee on Reappointment (PEACOR) review, an additional member will be selected at random from the pool of eligible senior associates in athletics to serve on the Appeal Committee alongside two regular members of the Appeals Council. The selected senior associate in athletics should have no shared coaching responsibilities with the appellant. The Appeals Council will hear and act upon any request (whether by a panel member or by the appellant) that any member be disqualified from serving on an Appeal Committee; such request must be submitted to the Appeals Council within one week after the appellant has been notified of the Appeal Committee's membership.\n\n**8.<a name=\"athletics\" id=\"athletics\"></a>  Physical Education and Athletics Committee on Reappointment**\n\nThe Physical Education and Athletics Committee on Reappointment (PEACOR) will be composed of the director of athletics, the senior woman administrator, a senior department member elected by the members of the department of physical education, the chair of the Faculty Athletic Policy Committee, and the dean of the College.  This committee will conduct major reviews of faculty in the department of physical education in accordance with the provisions for \"Review and Reappointment in the Department of Physical Education\" included in the rules of reappointment and tenure.\n","excerpt":"There are eight general councils and committees of the faculty: (1) The Council on Reviews (COR) consisting of the Promotions Committee and…","html":"<p>There are eight general councils and committees of the faculty:</p>\n<p>(1) The Council on Reviews (COR) consisting of the <a href=\"#PromoCom\">Promotions Committee</a> and the <a href=\"#RC\">Reappointments Committee</a></p>\n<p>(2) The <a href=\"#faculty_council\">Faculty Council</a></p>\n<p>(3) The <a href=\"#eac\">Educational Affairs Committee</a> (EAC)</p>\n<p>(4) The <a href=\"#cdei\">Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</a> (CDEI)</p>\n<p>(5) The <a href=\"#strategy\">Strategy Committee</a></p>\n<p>(6) The <a href=\"#resources\">Resources Committee</a></p>\n<p>(7) The <a href=\"#appeals\">Appeals Council</a></p>\n<p>(8) The <a href=\"#athletics\">Physical Education and Athletics Committee on Reappointment</a></p>\n<p>These bodies advise the administration and faculty on policy and act for the faculty in specified areas.</p>\n<p>Any council may establish standing or ad hoc committees, in addition to those designated below, which may include persons who are not members of the parent body.

The EAC considers proposals for new majors, standalone minors*, and programs, changes in degree requirements and the College academic calendar, and other matters of general educational policy, and refers the proposals it approves to the full faculty for further action. The Committee considers proposals for new and restored positions on the faculty and for replacement staffing for faculty on leave, and recommends the proposals it approves to the provost or the provost’s designate. The committee's purpose is to provide guidance and direction to the manner in which resources are allocated to carry out Middlebury's educational mission as a liberal arts college.</p>\n<p>*A standalone minor is defined as any minor for which there is no corresponding major.</p>\n<p><strong>b. <em>Composition</em></strong></p>\n<p>i. The EAC will be composed of seven members: five elected, full-time, tenured members of the faculty; and two academic administrators appointed by the provost, one of whom will chair the committee. The faculty members of the EAC will elect one of their members to serve as a co-chair, alongside the administrative co-chair. When voting is necessary, only the elected faculty members shall vote, except in the case of a tie, when the chair will cast a deciding vote.</p>\n<p>ii.

The administrative co-chair will coordinate the staffing proposal review process, convey EAC staffing recommendations to the provost, and communicate outcomes resulting from deliberations of the EAC. The faculty and administrative co-chairs together will write reports for the EAC.</p>\n<p>iii. In carrying out its functions, the EAC will create, as it deems necessary, ad hoc committees to obtain information and recommendations about particular issues. The composition of such ad hoc committees will be at the discretion of the EAC, except that ad hoc committees on matters of general educational policy or academic regulations will always include at least one student member.</p>\n<p>iv.

The EAC will consult with the SEAC prior to presenting proposals that require approval of the full faculty, such as proposals for new majors, standalone minors, and programs, changes in degree requirements and the College academic calendar, and other matters of general educational policy. The SEAC may initiate proposals for consideration by the EAC. The members of the SEAC are permitted to attend monthly faculty meetings, with the right to speak during consideration of curricular measures presented by the Educational Affairs Committee.</p>\n<p><strong>c. <em>Election</em></strong></p>\n<p>i.

All proposals for new programs and majors recommended by the EAC will be presented to the full faculty for a vote.</p>\n<p>iii. <em>Academic Regulations</em></p>\n<p>(a) Proposals for changes in academic regulations included in the catalog and the College Handbook will be referred to the Educational Affairs Committee.</p>\n<p>(b) The EAC may either consider these proposals itself, refer them to an ad hoc committee, or refer them to the Curriculum Committee.  Recommendations regarding changes in academic regulations may be brought directly to the faculty for a vote by an ad hoc committee or by the Curriculum Committee.</p>\n<p><strong>e. Standing Committees</strong></p>\n<p>The various standing committees will keep the Educational Affairs Committee informed of their activities through minutes of all their meetings. In a given year the EAC may also decide to concentrate its attention on the issues arising before a particular standing committee: at the EAC's request, one of its members may be named to sit on such a committee and to serve as a liaison between the two groups. The standing committees include:</p>\n<p><em>i. Curriculum Committee</em></p>\n<p>(a) <em>Composition</em>: the dean of curriculum, who is chair, four faculty members from different divisions, and two student members, elected by the Student Government Association.</p>\n<p>(b) <em>Function:</em> To approve or reject requests for additions, deletions, or alterations of courses that have been recommended by the appropriate divisions/departments; to act upon proposed changes in requirements for existing programs, majors, and minors; to exercise general oversight of the distribution requirement and the cultures and civilizations requirement; to exercise general oversight of the first-year seminar program; to undertake responsibility for the administration of an effective and well-balanced winter term program; to approve, in consultation with the dean of the College or designee, proposals from students for Independent Scholar status.

Policies overseen by the Administration Committee include but are not limited to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>course drops after the deadline for exceptional personal circumstances;</li>\n<li>reduced course load for exceptional personal circumstances;</li>\n<li>invocation of Pass/D/Fail status after the deadline for exceptional personal circumstances;</li>\n<li>requests for readmission after academic failure or conduct-related suspension;</li>\n<li>reinstatement for the purpose of credit transfer toward the Middlebury degree;</li>\n<li>exceptions allowing retaking of courses for which credit was earned;</li>\n<li>waivers of residence requirements for first-year Winter Term or senior year for non-medical reasons;</li>\n<li>grade change requests from faculty members.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Office of the Registrar may forward to the Administration Committee unusual or unprecedented petitions that fall within the office’s scope of responsibility for which the Registrar requests a Committee decision.</p>\n<p>The Administration Committee is composed of two co-chairs, generally a dean from the Dean of Students Office and a returning faculty member; three faculty members from across the academic divisions; and the registrar and associate registrar. Only the members of the faculty and dean serve as voting members.</p>\n<p>Middlebury’s academic policies embody the expectations that students are enrolled at Middlebury to pursue their academic degree; that they must adhere responsibly to the policies that support this goal; and that if factors arise that interfere with this goal, they will address them responsibly and/or seek help from Middlebury or external resources in a timely fashion. When evaluating petitions requesting exceptions to these policies, the Committee generally considers the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the goals of the relevant policies;</li>\n<li>the responsibilities of students and of the institution;</li>\n<li>the principles of fairness to the petitioner and of fairness to all other affected parties;</li>\n<li>the individual circumstances of the petitioner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Petitions may be approved, tabled, or denied. Petitions are tabled when the Committee identifies additional information needed for the evaluation; upon its receipt, the Committee resumes consideration. In cases of denial, petitioners who wish to provide relevant new or clarifying information may resubmit their petition to the Administration Committee for reconsideration.</p>\n<p>Procedures for submitting a petition may be found on the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/academic-life/Administration-Committee\">Administration Committee website</a>.</p>\n<p>iii. <em>Athletic Policy Committee</em></p>\n<p>The committee has the responsibility to formulate and recommend to the faculty policy concerning intercollegiate athletics for Middlebury College undergraduates, in accordance with the rules of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), and the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), in which Middlebury maintains membership.

Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (CDEI)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>a. Function</strong></p>\n<p>The Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is the primary faculty governance body addressing institutional and social diversity in the broadest sense, serving as an independent advocacy group, advisory body, and faculty network for exchange and support of ideas and policies. The committee consults and meets, at least once per academic year, with different entities such as the Senior Leadership Group, the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, the Strategy and Resources Committees, the Alliance for an Inclusive Middlebury, the Admissions Office, the Educational Affairs Committee and its subcommittees (in particular, the Curriculum Committee and Administration Committee). Its activities take two forms: reaching out to the relevant parts of the College to address issues raised among the faculty, and being a resource for various parts of the College to consult for a faculty perspective on diversity. It works to strengthen Middlebury’s commitment to the ideals, practices, and policies with which we collectively seek equity and inclusion across the institution by working with and through other institutional governance structures to provide recommendations that support students, staff and faculty work toward these goals. The committee's areas of attention may include but are not limited to the following:</p>\n<p>1)  Faculty Leadership</p>\n<p>The CDEI represents faculty perspectives on diversity policies and practices, and serves as the institutional connection between the administration and the faculty on issues of diversity, inclusion, and equity. It advocates for opportunities for all faculty members to learn more strategies to address these issues in their teaching, promote a culture of inclusivity, and enhance our potential for institutional transformation. The CDEI meets with the Provost at least once each semester, and with other members of the Senior Leadership Group as necessary. The CDEI also works with the Student Government Association and other relevant student groups (such as the Black Student Union, Women of Color, and Distinguished Men of Color) to ensure open and productive communication between students and faculty around issues pertaining to diversity at Middlebury.</p>\n<p>2)  Policy Brokerage</p>\n<p>The CDEI compiles and expresses faculty concerns and suggestions for transforming Middlebury’s status quo. It serves both as a sounding board for the administration to workshop its ideas for policy changes, and as a loudspeaker for faculty ideas. This brokerage function is particularly important for junior faculty with concerns and good ideas, who may be cautious about asserting themselves while working their way toward tenure.</p>\n<p>3)  Communication and Reporting</p>\n<p>The CDEI occasionally reports on its activities at faculty meetings, in addition to setting an agenda of targets and goals at the beginning of each academic year. It also responds to faculty questions and initiatives relating to issues of racism, diversity, and inclusion as these emerge from these meetings and the other mechanisms of faculty governance. At the end of each academic year, the CDEI will submit a brief report to the faculty on its deliberations and actions, and identify issues for consideration the following year. This report will be included in the minutes of the last plenary session of the faculty.</p>\n<p>4)  Outreach</p>\n<p>The CDEI annually engages the College faculty in a discussion of issues of race, diversity, and inclusion, especially as they relate to the College, and solicit faculty input regarding them. Pragmatically, this may take the form of an annual Summit on Diversity and Inclusion. The committee may also sponsor reading groups or lectures on topics related to issues in higher education that warrant consideration by the faculty. It can also keep records, numbers, and data about diversity issues in a centralized and public space, open to all faculty. This resource will solidify our institutional memory and support curricular and institutional innovations.</p>\n<p><strong>b. Composition</strong></p>\n<p>The CDEI will consist of six faculty members, with the Chief Diversity Officer serving as an ex officio member and attending its meetings at the committee’s invitation. The committee should reflect the diversity that Middlebury seeks to achieve. No more than two CDEI members shall be junior faculty. Faculty Council will be responsible for inviting and appointing some members of this committee, with the expectation that the procedure would maintain the CDEI’s autonomy in relation to rest of the College’s administration and governance structure. It will meet at least once per month, and more often as necessary.</p>\n<p>Membership on the CDEI is open to all tenured faculty members, all pre-tenure faculty members on regular appointment, and all faculty members on special appointment who have contracts extending for at least one year beyond the date of the start of the term to which they would be elected or appointed. A member of the CDEI must have completed two years of full-time faculty status at Middlebury before their term begins. A member of the CDEI may not simultaneously serve on the Council on Reviews, Faculty Council, Educational Affairs Committee, Strategy Committee, Resources Committee, or Appeals Council. No more than two members of the CDEI may be from one division and no more than one member may be from one department. The departmental affiliation of the Chief Diversity Officer will not figure into the distribution of members.</p>\n<p>The term for members of the CDEI is three years. Two of the positions will be elected by the faculty. The remaining four positions will be appointed by the Faculty Council in its role as the Committee on Committees. Faculty Council should consider ways to ensure that the CDEI membership includes interest in, expertise about, and community support on diversity issues. It could, for example, require that one of the Faculty Council-appointed positions be from an academic department that directly addresses diversity issues. It could create a student nomination process for another of these positions.</p>\n<p>Elections and appointments will normally be for three-year terms. Positions that become vacant due to leaves, retirements, or for other reasons will be filled in the same way that the departing member was first selected for the committee: vacancies in elected positions will be filled by election, and vacancies in appointed positions will be filled by appointment.</p>\n<p>The CDEI will elect one of its own tenured members as chair. The chair will run meetings, set meeting agendas, write reports, report to the faculty at plenary meetings, and coordinate work with other committee chairs as needed.</p>\n<p><strong>c. <em>Election</em></strong></p>\n<p>For election for the CDEI, a preliminary ballot will include a list of all eligible tenured members, all eligible pre-tenured faculty members on regular appointment, and all eligible faculty members on special appointment who have contracts extending for at least one year beyond the date of start of the term to which they would be electedFaculty members already serving on Council on Reviews, Faculty Council, Educational Affairs Committee, Strategy Committee, Resources Committee, those who will be on leave during the following year, and those made ineligible or whose obligation is waived because of stipulations set forth above are ineligible for election.  On the preliminary ballot, faculty members may vote for up to five candidates. Following the preliminary ballot, a second ballot will be distributed, listing the names of the five candidates who received the greatest number of votes on the preliminary ballot. Faculty members may vote for up to two candidates on the second ballot. After the second round of voting, a final ballot will be distributed, listing the two candidates who received the greatest number of votes on the second ballot. Faculty members may vote for one candidate on the final ballot. The candidate with the greatest number of votes will be declared elected.</p>\n<p>If there is a second vacancy on the CDEI to be filled by election in a given year, the election procedure as described above will be repeated. If the vacancies are of different lengths, the longest vacancy will be decided by the first round of election, and shorter vacancyby subsequent rounds of election.</p>\n<p>In the event of a tie vote on the preliminary ballot of any election, the names of candidates who received the five highest vote totals will be included on the second ballot. On the second ballot of any election, in the event of a tie among three or more candidates for first place, a runoff ballot will be issued, listing the names of the tied candidates. Faculty members may vote for one candidate on the runoff ballot. The names of the two candidates who received the greatest number of votes on the runoff ballot will appear on the final ballot. On the second ballot of any election, in the event of a tie among two or more candidates for second place, a runoff ballot will be issued, listing the names of the tied candidates. Faculty members may vote for one candidate on the runoff ballot. The name of the candidate who received the greatest number of votes on the runoff ballot will appear on the final ballot, along with the name of the candidate who received the greatest number of votes on the second ballot.</p>\n<p><strong>d. Procedures</strong></p>\n<p>In carrying out its functions, the CDEI may create <em>ad hoc</em> committees comprised of other faculty (and, as necessary, staff members and students) as needed.  The procedures for seeking approval of CDEI initiatives will be dictated by the nature of the initiative, but will follow existing channels for review as appropriate, including but not limited to the SGA, Community Council, Faculty Council, Educational Affairs Committee, and full faculty vote.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"strategy\" id=\"strategy\"></a>5. The Strategy Committee</strong></p>\n<p><strong>a. <em>Function</em></strong></p>\n<p>The Strategy Committee represents the College faculty in long-range strategic planning with the administration and the Board of Trustees. Though the committee is concerned primarily with the College, it will also represent the faculty in shared-governance discussions on matters of common interest to the College, the Schools, and the Institute. The committee is also charged with engaging the faculty, administration, and trustees on developments in higher education (both nationally and globally), as they might affect Middlebury College. In fulfilling this charge, the Strategy Committee will:</p>\n<p>1. Work closely with the provost to develop and monitor long-range strategic planning especially as it relates to the integrity of Middlebury College and possible collaborations among it, the Schools, and the Institute.</p>\n<p>2. Meet each fall and spring term, and at other times as necessary, with the Resources Committee to review Middlebury’s finances as they relate to current and long-range priorities involving the College’s mission.

Meet regularly, as representatives of the College’s faculty, with the Strategy Committee of the Board of Trustees to review Middlebury’s long-range planning, especially as it relates to the academic mission of Middlebury College and its collaborations with the Institute and the Schools. When appropriate and by agreement with the administration and members of the Board’s Strategy Committee, these discussions may be held in confidence, with the expectation that in due course they will receive full and open discussion as any resultant decision-making procedure unfolds.</p>\n<p>7. Contribute to the development of strategic plans initiated by the administration or the Board of Trustees. The committee will work with any ad hoc planning committee appointed by the administration or the Board, either through the appointment of one or more members of the Strategy Committee to the ad hoc planning committee, or through active consultation with the ad hoc planning committee.</p>\n<p>8. At the end of each academic year submit a brief report to the faculty on its deliberations and actions, and identify issues for consideration the following year.

General Provisions**\n\n**<a name=\"purpose\" id=\"purpose\"></a>a. Purpose**\n\nThe Rules of Appointment and Tenure set forth the regulations and the procedures affecting appointments of the instructional faculty of Middlebury College. These criteria and procedures apply to the Council on Reviews (consisting of the Reappointments Committee and the Promotions Committee), to the president, the provost, and to all academic departments and programs at Middlebury College, and are the only criteria and procedures that may be required as conditions for appointment, reappointment, and promotion. Because its judgment is central to general educational policy, the faculty has primary responsibility (exercised through the Council on Reviews, academic departments and programs, and individual faculty members) to make recommendations for appointment. The president normally follows the recommendation of the Promotions Committee. The provost normally follows the recommendation of the Reappointments Committee. In cases where the president or provost does not follow the recommendation of the Promotions Committee or the Reappointments Committee, respectively, they will communicate the reasons to the appropriate committee and the reasons will be stated in the review file.\n\n**<a name=\"principles\" id=\"principles\"></a>b. Principles**\n\n**i. *Teaching*.** Middlebury College expects to appoint to the faculty people of exceptional promise and achievement as teachers and as scholars or artists, who will help students to grow and to develop habits of lifelong learning, critical inquiry, and lucid communication.\n\nAs a residential liberal arts college, Middlebury views teaching from a broad perspective that extends beyond the activities in classrooms, laboratories, studios, and recital halls. Advising students, providing guidance for independent projects, and the careful evaluation of student work are important components of a faculty member's responsibilities. Public lectures, presentations, or performances also contribute to teaching at Middlebury.\n\n**ii. *Scholarship*.** Middlebury believes that a faculty actively engaged in scholarship enriches the intellectual climate of the College. The mastery of new knowledge or skills, including those outside of the faculty member's own discipline, is valued as a contribution to the intellectual life of the College; however, the quality of a faculty member's scholarship is evaluated primarily through his or her published, performed, or executed works. Scholarly achievement that is recognized as of significantly high quality by scholars or artists beyond Middlebury College is a prerequisite for promotion to tenure.\n\n**iii. *Service*.** The Middlebury faculty has a vital role to play in sustaining the intellectual climate of the College outside the classroom, in governing the College, and in extending the impact of the College beyond the bounds of the campus. Beyond teaching and scholarship, the service roles played by individual faculty members include departmental, program, and committee responsibilities, activities with student organizations, participation in admissions or alumni activities, and other activities that benefit Middlebury College.\n\n**iv. _Academic Freedom_.** Adapted from the 1940 \"Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure\" of the American Association of University Professors:\n\n_(a) Purposes_. Institutions of higher education are conducted for the common good and not to further the interests of either the individual teacher or the institution as a whole. The common good depends upon the free search for truth and its free exposition.\n\nAcademic freedom is essential to these purposes and applies to both teaching and research. Freedom in research is fundamental to the advancement of truth. Academic freedom in its teaching aspect is fundamental for the protection of the rights of the teacher in teaching and of the student to freedom in learning. It carries with it duties correlative with rights.\n\nTenure is a means to certain ends; specifically: (1) freedom of teaching and research and of extramural activities and (2) a sufficient degree of economic security to make the profession attractive to men and women of ability. Freedom and economic security, hence, tenure, are indispensable to the success of an institution in fulfilling its obligations to its students and to society.\n\n*(b) Principles.* The teacher is entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of his or her other academic duties; but research for pecuniary return should be based upon an understanding with the authorities of the institution.\n\nThe teacher is entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing his or her subject, but should be careful not to introduce into his or her teaching controversial matter which has no relation to the subject. Limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the institution should be clearly stated in writing at the time of the appointment.\n\nCollege or university teachers are citizens, members of learned professions, and officers of an educational institution. In speaking or writing as citizens, they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline, but their special position in the community imposes special obligations. As persons of learning and educational officers, they should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances. Hence, they should at all times be accurate, should exercise appropriate restraint, should show respect for the opinions of others, and should make every effort to indicate that they are not institutional spokespeople.\n\nConsistent with AAUP’s 1940 “Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure” and its subsequent amendments, all members of the Middlebury College faculty are entitled to full academic freedom described above regardless of race, color, ethnicity, sex, religion, national origin, age, disability, marital status, place of birth, veteran status, gender identity and expression, or sexual orientation.\n\n**<a name=\"faculty_appts\" id=\"faculty_appts\"></a>c. Faculty Appointments**\n\n**i. *Regular and Term Appointments***. Both term and regular appointments may be offered at any faculty rank. Regular appointments are renewable and subject to the Review and Reappointment procedures described in subsections 1.e. and 1.f. below. Faculty on regular appointment normally pass through a probationary period whose length may vary with prior service elsewhere, during that time undergoing one or more reviews that will evaluate, both for the faculty member and for the College, the progress they have made in developing the qualities that may lead to appointment without limit of tenure.\n\nTerm appointments are either for specified terms only, or renewable, but faculty on term appointments are not eligible for tenure. Whether a faculty position is to be a regular or term appointment shall be determined by the provost, with the advice of the Educational Affairs Committee, prior to the filling of the position. Any change from a term to a regular appointment must be initiated by the appropriate department chair, recommended by the EAC, and approved by the provost. A faculty member who holds a regular Middlebury faculty appointment cannot be appointed after the first review to a full-time faculty position outside of rank. Faculty appointments are considered to be in rank when they use the following titles:\n\n*(a) Instructor:* Normal rank for faculty who have not completed the Ph.D. degree or equivalent terminal degree. The completion of the degree normally leads to promotion to Assistant Professor without a review by the Council on Reviews.\n\n*(b) Assistant Professor:* Normal rank for faculty who have completed a terminal degree, but who have not been reviewed for and appointed to tenure.\n\n*(c) Associate Professor:* Normal rank for first appointment with tenure, or whose initial appointment, based on accomplishment elsewhere, is at the rank of associate professor.\n\n*(d) Professor:* The rank awarded to faculty who have passed the post-tenure review described in 1.f.iv. below, or whose initial appointment, based on accomplishment elsewhere, is at the rank of professor.\n\n**ii. *Special Appointments***. Individuals with special appointments normally do not follow the schedule of reviews and promotions of regular faculty. Special appointments are assigned one of the faculty titles below. Special appointments may be within or outside of rank, do not carry tenure, and are not subject to the review and reappointment procedures described in subsection 1.e. However, faculty members on renewable special appointment are subject to periodic Contract Reviews by the Reappointments Committee, as specified in subsection 3.f., below.\n\n*(a) Lecturer and Senior Lecturer:* Renewable full- or part-time term appointments to fulfill specialized teaching responsibilities. Lecturers are not required to have a terminal degree. After at least nine years of consecutive service and following a successful Contract Review, Lecturers will be reappointed as Senior Lecturers.\n\n_(b) Assistant Professor (non-tenure-track):_ Multi-year appointments of two to five years in length with less than full-time teaching responsibilities. Faculty appointed to this rank must have a terminal degree. Those individuals hired at this rank who are ABD will initially be appointed as Instructor. For those on two-year contracts, the department or program will normally request an increase to at least a three-year contract if it requests a second renewal. For those on three-year contracts, the department or program will normally request an increase to a five-year contract if it requests a second renewal.\n\n*(c) Associate Professor (without tenure):* Faculty appointed as Assistant Professor (non-tenure-track) may be promoted to Associate Professor (without tenure) after at least two successful contract reviews, as described in subsection 3.f. below, and at least six years of consecutive service.\n\n*(d) Assistant in Instruction:* Full- or part-time renewable term appointments to fulfill specialized teaching functions associated with courses. Assistants in Instruction serve as teaching assistants, work one-on-one with students, and/or provide technical support for student work.\n\n*(e) Laboratory Instructor:* Full- or part-time renewable term appointments to fulfill specialized teaching functions associated with the laboratory components of courses. Laboratory Instructors have full responsibility for teaching and curriculum design of laboratory sections. Laboratory Instructors must have an advanced degree, but do not have a terminal degree.\n\n*(f) Assistant Laboratory Professor:* Full- or part-time renewable term appointments to fulfill specialized teaching functions associated with the laboratory components of courses. Assistant Laboratory Professors have full responsibility for teaching and curriculum design of laboratory sections. Assistant Laboratory Professors must have a terminal degree.\n\n*(g) Associate Laboratory Professor:* Full-or part-time renewable term appointments to fulfill specialized teaching functions associate with the laboratory components of courses. Faculty appointed as Assistant Laboratory Professor may be promoted to Associate Laboratory Professor after at least two successful contract reviews, as described in subsection 3.f. below, and at least six years of consecutive service. Associate Laboratory Professors must have a terminal degree.\n\n*(h) Visiting Appointments:* Visiting appointments are full- or part-time term appointments that may be offered to faculty for no more than three years. At the conclusion of the term of the visiting appointment, it may be converted to a new renewable contract or regular appointment under the provisions specified above.\n\n*(i) Adjunct Appointments:* Adjunct appointments are part-time term appointments that may be made at any adjunct title and may be renewed. Adjunct appointments normally are offered to individuals whose major professional responsibilities lie outside teaching.\n\n*(j) Physical Education:* Faculty in the Department of Physical Education receive renewable term appointments in rank, and are subject to the review procedures as outlined in the contiguous section \"Reviews for Physical Education Faculty\".   Physical Education Faculty appointments are considered as such when they use the following titles:\n\ni. Instructor in Physical Education – This is the normal starting rank for coaches who have limited coaching background.  Term contracts are issued for one or two years.\n\nii. Assistant in Physical Education – This is the normal rank for Head Coaches and Program Directors, who possess significant coaching and/or program experience.  A Master's degree is preferred, (but not required). The rank is granted to coaches who show the promise of superior coaching and teaching ability based on previous coaching and/or program experience. Coaches in this rank will generally be offered a three-year contract, and upon successful reviews, a second three-year contract.\n\niii. Associate in Physical Education – This is the normal rank for coaching faculty who have demonstrated superior coaching and teaching ability, and after a major review are appointed to a renewable five-year contract. A Master's degree is preferred.\n\niv. Senior Associate in Physical Education – This is the rank awarded to coaching faculty who have undergone a major contract review during the tenth year as an Associate and continue to demonstrate superior coaching and teaching ability. A faculty member with a Senior Contract will be granted a renewable seven-year contract.\n\n*(f) Administrative Appointments:* Senior College administrators whose major professional responsibilities are in support of the instructional program may be granted faculty rank.\n\n**iii. *Associate Appointments***. Associate appointments are regular faculty appointments in rank which normally carry no more than one-half the normal College teaching responsibility. Associates have all the rights, responsibilities, and privileges of their rank, including tenure for associates at the rank of associate professor or professor. (See section a. in *Special Provisions of Appointment* for procedures and conditions.)\n\n**iv. *Appointments and Voting Rights***. All faculty on regular appointment, regular faculty on associate status, senior College administrators with faculty rank, and full-time and part-time teaching faculty on special appointment, except for adjunct faculty, may vote.\n\n**v. *Appointments and Committee Assignments***. Faculty members on regular, full-time special appointment, or associate appointment are eligible for assignment or election to all faculty committees and councils, provided all conditions for membership are met. All faculty members are expected to fulfill normal advising and administrative responsibilities.\n\n**<a name=\"procedure_appt\" id=\"procedure_appt\"></a>d. Procedures of Appointment**\n\n**i. *New appointments***. New appointments are made by the president or the president's designate in accordance with the authority vested in them by the Board of Trustees. New appointments, reappointments, and promotions are reported by the president to the board at its regular meetings.\n\nIn considering appointment to the faculty of a person not already serving on it, the president will solicit the advice of the chair of the department concerned and such other advice and recommendation as they may deem appropriate.\n\n**ii.** Offer of appointment or reappointment to the faculty will in all cases be tendered in writing and shall include a statement of precise terms and conditions of appointment and status of appointment with respect to tenure, and in the Department of Physical Education and Athletics with respect to contract terms.  For a person already serving on the faculty, such offer will be extended early enough to be in their hand no later than the notification date as specified below in 4.f., Notification Date.\n\n**iii.** Acceptance of appointment likewise will be tendered in writing. In the case of a person already serving on the faculty, such written acceptance or rejection shall be returned not more than 15 days after the notification date. Some extension of this period may be permitted by the president or the president's designate upon specific request in an exceptional case.\n\n**iv.** Notice of non-reappointment of a person serving on the faculty will be given in writing no later than the notification date as specified below in 4.f., Notification Date. Such notice shall be deemed to have been given if the appointment upon which the person concerned is then serving was specifically stated to be a terminal appointment.\n\n**<a name=\"review_reappt\" id=\"review_reappt\"></a>e. Review and Reappointment**\n\n**i. *Review schedule***. Faculty on regular appointment whose first full-time appointment is at Middlebury are reviewed in the third year of appointment. Those who are reappointed following the first review will normally be reviewed for tenure in the spring of the seventh year after initial appointment. A request for early review that anticipates notification by December 15 or February 15 should be received by the Promotions Committee by May 15 prior; a request that anticipates notification by May 15 should be received by December 15 prior.\n\n**ii. *First Review***. In the third year of appointment to the faculty, unless there is credit for prior service, the Reappointments Committee undertakes a thorough review of the faculty member for evidence of accomplishment in teaching, scholarly or creative activity, and promise of outstanding teaching and developing scholarly or artistic achievement appropriate to the year in which the review takes place. The composition and long-term needs of the department and the faculty will also be considered. The procedures to be followed for the first review are set forth below.\n\nThe Reappointments Committee will arrange a meeting with successful first review candidates within one month of the review. The only persons present will be the candidate, the Reappointments Committee, and the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty (VPAA/DoF), as secretary to the Reappointments Committee.\n\n**iii.** **_Post Review Consultation_**. After passing the first review and within a month after the obligatory meeting between the Reappointments Committee and the faculty member, the dean for faculty development and research (DFDR) shall arrange a meeting with the faculty member and the department chair to discuss the development of the faculty member's career from the perspectives of both the individual and the department chair. The procedures for these interviews are set forth below.\n\n**iv. *Appointments Following a Negative Review***. Faculty who, having undergone review for tenure, are denied reappointment shall be offered a one-year terminal appointment, but in no case will such appointment extend beyond the academic year following the year of the review. No person who has failed a review and left the Middlebury Faculty may be considered for any appointment to the Faculty.\n\n**<a name=\"promote_tenure\" id=\"promote_tenure\"></a>f. Promotion to Tenure**\n\n**i. *Institutional Assumptions Regarding Promotion to Tenure***. The granting of tenure, whether with or without promotion in rank, is recommended by the president to the Board of Trustees or its designated committee or subcommittee for approval. The College expects to appoint to tenure faculty who are of exceptional quality as teachers and who are scholars or artists of significant achievement as recognized by the broader academic community beyond Middlebury. Such long-term institutional commitment to an individual's career comes with the expectation of a demonstrable reciprocal commitment by the faculty member to the departmental and College curricula and to the broader life of the institution. College involvement cannot compensate for an absence of scholarly or creative achievement, but its presence must be considered as the institution assesses tenurability. Tenure reviews will be based solely on the performance of the candidate, without regard to numerical quotas.\n\nProcedures for the review for tenure are set forth below.\n\n**ii.** **_Tenure_**. Appointment as associate professor or professor, after the passing of a Review for Tenure, is normally without limit of time (to normal retirement). Faculty at these ranks are regarded by the College as having tenure. Because Middlebury is primarily a teaching institution, there is an expectation of continued dedication to and high performance in teaching, in addition to an expectation of continuing achievement in scholarship and of service to the College.\n\n**iii.** **_Initial Appointment with Tenure._** Initial appointment to the Middlebury faculty at the rank of professor or associate professor with tenure shall be made by the president after consultation with the provost and the Promotions Committee and with the approval of the Board of Trustees. The Promotions Committee shall apply the same criteria in these appointments when advising the president and provost as in those from within the College. Such appointments will be rare and made only for appointees of exceptional qualifications.\n\n**iv. *Review for Promotion to Professor***. Associate professors are first reviewed by the Promotions Committee at a time of their choosing, no earlier than the fifth and no later than the tenth year (eighth year for faculty tenured prior to 2011) following appointment to tenure, for possible promotion to professor. This review is regarded as an opportunity for reassessment of professional achievements, and the basis for promotion will be evidence of continued excellence in teaching, achievement in scholarship, and service to the institution. Should the faculty member not be promoted, a similar review will be conducted at intervals of the faculty member's choosing, no earlier than three and no later than five years following the unsuccessful review until the faculty member has been promoted to professor or has departed from the faculty. When initial appointment to the Middlebury faculty is at the rank of associate professor with tenure, the date of review for promotion to the rank of professor shall be determined at the time of appointment and stated in the letter of appointment.\n\nProcedures for the promotion review are set forth below.\n\n**v. *Ten-year review***. In the tenth year after promotion to full professor and every ten years thereafter, each full professor will undergo a professional review by the Reappointments Committee. The review has two goals: to assess professional achievements since promotion to full professor (or since the last ten-year review) and to aid in formulating plans for further growth and development.\n\nAs a result of the review, the vice president for Academic Affairs/dean of the faculty (VPAA/DoF) may choose to recognize unusually distinguished service or consider action with respect to problems that have become apparent during the review. The VPAA/DoF will also discuss with the faculty member under review ways in which the College might help that person attain his or her goals for professional growth. Within the limits of its financial means, and in the interest of continuing faculty development, the College will attempt to offer leave opportunities to faculty members shortly after the ten-year review.\n\nProcedures for the ten-year review are set forth below.\n\n**<a name=\"review_procedures\" id=\"review_procedures\"></a>2\\. Review Procedures**\n\n**<a name=\"review_purpose\" id=\"review_purpose\"></a>a. Purpose**\n\nThe review procedures complement the Rules of Reappointment and Tenure by enumerating the responsibilities of all parties charged with conducting a review for reappointment, tenure, or promotion to full professor.\n\n**<a name=\"review_eval_teach\" id=\"review_eval_teach\"></a>b. Evaluation of Teaching**\n\n**i. *Criteria***. Evaluation of teaching effectiveness includes an assessment by oneself and by one's peers, and the evaluations by students. In no case will evaluation of teaching be based solely on course response forms. Teaching should be taken in its broad sense, to include not only formal classroom work, but also the candidate's contributions to the curriculum, advising, and other teaching outside the classroom. Nonetheless, evaluation will always include observation of classroom teaching *(see Classroom Visits below).*\n\nCriteria considered for evaluation of teaching will include:\n\n*(a)* overall quality of the learning experience provided to students;\n\n*(b)* effectiveness in promoting student thinking and learning;\n\n*(c)* quality of classroom instruction;\n\n*(d)* organization of courses;\n\n*(e)* availability and helpfulness to students;\n\n*(f)* care in evaluating student work;\n\n*(g)* ability to teach a broad range of students; and\n\n*(h)* teaching outside the classroom.\n\n**ii. _Course Response Forms_.** Faculty members will receive a pdf of their course response forms via email following the end of the term and after all grades have been submitted.  Faculty member's course response forms are stored electronically on a secure server with the Office of Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty, where they may be consulted only by the president, the provost, the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty, the department chair, and the Reappointments Committee or Promotions Committee. Program directors will have access to all course response forms for courses taught with an explicit program label, either as a standalone or cross-listed course.  . A faculty member may request the addition of personal comments or other materials  with the course response forms which they believe may be useful in the interpretation of the forms.  Faculty members must share their personal copies of course response forms with colleagues writing on their behalf. The VPAA/DoF cannot grant access to electronic files to anyone other than those listed above. All course response forms are kept until the faculty member is reviewed for tenure. After the tenure review, CRFs five years and older will be deleted.\n\nFaculty who have completed the equivalent of two years of full-time teaching may designate one course every two years as \"CRF-optional\". In these cases, those forms are held separately and not uploaded to the server. The faculty member may then decide whether to include the forms in their file held by the administration.\n\n**iii. *Classroom Visits***. In the semester preceding the term in which the review takes place, the candidate should arrange with the department chair an appropriate schedule of class visits over the two terms. The chair (or a senior member of the department designated by the chair and acceptable to the candidate) will visit at least two classes. Other colleagues may visit classes if the candidate invites them. It is the responsibility of the chair to ensure that the visits are not unnecessarily disruptive. Following classroom visits, and before the end of the term during which the visits take place, if the candidate wishes it, each visiting colleague will meet with the individual being evaluated to discuss his or her performance in the classes visited and to make suggestions for possible improvement. Members of the Reappointments Committee or Promotions Committee, however, will not normally offer such commentaries. In all cases, which classes will be visited will be agreed on in advance by the candidate and the visitors.\n\n**<a name=\"review_eval_scholarship\" id=\"review_eval_scholarship\"></a>c. Evaluation of Scholarship**\n\nA candidate's scholarship or artistic production is considered in terms of activity and of achievement.\n\n*Scholarly activity* represents a pattern of related professional involvements, which may include: research and experimentation; writing, analyzing, creating; presentations to peers or to the public; responsible roles in professional organizations; visiting professorships; applying for and receiving outside grants and fellowships; and developing new fields of expertise.\n\n*Scholarly achievement* is the result of that activity, primarily as evidenced in work that has been (a) performed, executed, or published (as original research communicated to specialists or as the synthesis and interpretation of scholarly material for a more general audience), and (b) recognized as being of significantly high quality by scholars and artists within the broader academic community beyond Middlebury College.\n\nEvaluation is undertaken by colleagues and by other appropriate professionals in the candidate's field. In reviews for tenure and for full professor (not required for faculty who were awarded tenure prior to 2011), scholars from outside the College will be asked to judge the candidate's scholarship. Evaluators will be supplied with the Handbook description of the scholarly activity and achievement appropriate to the review in question and will be asked to evaluate it on that basis.\n\n**<a name=\"review_eval_service\" id=\"review_eval_service\"></a>d. Evaluation of Service**\n\nInstitutional service becomes a criterion for evaluation along with teaching and scholarship at the tenure review and at the review for promotion to professor. It may be as diverse in form as is the faculty itself. Information regarding such service will be solicited from the candidates, from their departments, from their programs (when relevant), and through collegial letters for assessment by the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee.\n\nCollege service cannot compensate for an absence of achievement in teaching and scholarly or creative production. Nevertheless, the College recognizes that on occasion it must call upon an untenured faculty member to undertake a particularly demanding institutional role that may impede scholarly progress. At the time of such an appointment, the untenured faculty member may request that the VPAA/DoF, in consultation with the Promotions Committee, give written permission for a one-year postponement of the tenure review to permit additional time for scholarly achievement.\n\n**<a name=\"dept_eval\" id=\"dept_eval\"></a>e. Departmental Evaluation**\n\nThe department letter is written by the chair. This letter will state the chair's judgment concerning the candidate's fitness for reappointment, tenure, or promotion and the reasons for it. In preparing this recommendation, the chair will conduct two or more classroom visits for reappointment and tenure reviews, one or more visits for post-tenure reviews, review the candidate's course response forms and other materials submitted to the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee for review, as well as the written recommendations of the tenured members of the department or of full professors when the review is for promotion to professor. The chair also will present, in the departmental letter, an accurate summary of the views, without attribution, of the senior members of the department.\n\n**<a name=\"program_eval\" id=\"program_eval\"></a>f. Program Director's Evaluation**\n\nA program director will submit a letter of programmatic evaluation in faculty reviews if and only if (i) programmatic involvement is explicitly stated in the letter of appointment; or (ii) the faculty member under review requests that the VPAA/DoF solicit a letter from the appropriate program director. This letter will state the director's judgment concerning the candidate's fitness for reappointment, tenure, or promotion and the reasons for it. The VPAA/DoF will solicit letters from at least two other senior members of the program, whom the program director selects in consultation with the candidate under review. The program director will provide the faculty member under review the names of these senior members. These letters will go to the program director and to the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee. In preparing the program letter, the director will review the candidate's vita; syllabi from relevant courses; an example of scholarly work; when the candidate has taught a course with an explicit program label, the course response forms from those courses; and, when relevant, the written recommendations of the solicited program members. The director will also present, in the programmatic letter, an accurate summary of the views, without attribution, of any senior members of the program who have been solicited to write letters. In cases where a program is based entirely within a department, the program director will write an individual letter that will go to the department chair and to the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee. The department chair will summarize the views of the program director in the departmental letter. In such instances, the program director's letter will not be made available to the candidate.\n\n**<a name=\"confidentiality\" id=\"confidentiality\"></a>g. Confidentiality and Access**\n\nLetters from students and alumni are always confidential. Letters from outside evaluators are always confidential. Letters from colleagues at Middlebury are made available to candidates only in the event of a decision to deny reappointment. Restricting access is meant to ensure frank and honest assessments of the candidates. The letters should be accurate in matters of fact upon which judgments are based. The departmental letter (i.e., the letter written by a chair that summarizes, without attribution, the views of tenured colleagues) will be made available to the candidate at the time when it is submitted to the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee. If a program letter is written, it will also be made available to the candidate at the time when it is submitted to the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee. Any response to the departmental or programmatic letter that the candidate wishes to submit to the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee must be submitted to the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee and made available to the department chair or program director within two weeks of the receipt of the chair's or director's letter. Any further letters of response, either from the chair, the director, or the candidate, will be held in confidence by the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee.\n\nThe VPAA/DoF, the president, the provost, and members of the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee will have access to all materials submitted in connection with a review. The department chair will have access to letters from other senior members of the department and to the candidate's vita, publications, and course response forms. The program director will have access to solicited letters from other senior members of the program and to the candidate's vita, relevant syllabi, an example of scholarship, and, when the candidate has taught a course with an explicit program label, course response forms from those courses.\n\n**<a name=\"procedures_responsibilities\" id=\"procedures_responsibilities\"></a>3\\. Procedures and Responsibilities**\n\n**_<a name=\"firstr\" id=\"firstr\"></a>a. First Review_**\n\nThe first review examines a faculty member's performance for evidence of accomplishment in teaching, of scholarly or creative activity, and of promise of outstanding teaching and scholarly or artistic achievement of significant quality. The evaluation of scholarship includes the assessment of the candidate, members of the candidate's department, and other faculty colleagues. The composition and long-term needs of the department and the faculty are also considered in this review.\n\n_i. The Candidate_\n\n*(a)* Candidates are expected to have completed the requirements for the terminal degree. Failure to complete the terminal degree (normally the Ph.D.) by the time of the first review creates the presumption that the criterion of scholarly activity has not been satisfied. This presumption can be rebutted only by strong evidence (1) that the required written or artistic work is completed, but not yet defended, or (2) that there is other scholarly achievement of exceptionally high quality.\n\n*(b)* To arrange with the chair, or the chair's designate, an appropriate schedule of classroom visits.\n\n*(c)* If the candidate so desires, to invite other colleagues to visit classes.\n\n_(d)_ To submit to the department chair and to the Reappointments Committee in a timely manner a complete vita, course syllabi, and other materials requested, as well as materials that the candidate thinks pertinent. For example, a faculty member may request the inclusion of personal comments or other materials with the course response forms which they believe may be useful in the interpretation of the forms.  To submit to the program director, when relevant, a complete vita, syllabi from relevant courses, and an example of scholarly work.\n\n*(e)* To submit to the Reappointments Committee scholarly publications, a dissertation, and/or other appropriate evidence of scholarship or artistic activity.\n\n*(f)* To arrange with members of the Reappointments Committee an appropriate schedule of classroom visits.\n\n_(g)_ To prepare a self-evaluation that concentrates on teaching performance and scholarly activity with reference to the criteria listed in 2.b. and 2.c. above. The evaluation of scholarly activity should project a program leading to a level of scholarly achievement suitable for tenure. The letter may include identification of any factors that have hindered progress.\n\n_ii. Reappointments Committee_\n\n_(a)_ To meet with the candidates for the first review, in a group or individually, to explain to them the procedures; and to invite the candidates to submit, either orally or in writing, any additional information that may be pertinent to their reviews. A candidate's decision not to submit such materials is in no way prejudicial to reappointment.\n\n*(b)* To have one of its members serve as a liaison to the faculty member during the review and to meet with the faculty member early in the term of the review, and later during that term if necessary or if requested by the candidate to explain the procedures for the review, answer any questions, and receive additional information the candidate considers pertinent to the review.\n\n_(c)_ To arrange with the candidate an appropriate schedule of classroom visits. At least two members should each visit at least two of the candidate's classes, or one class and one public lecture. Additional classroom visits may be scheduled as deemed necessary by the committee. (Commentary on teaching will not be offered by members of the Reappointments Committee.)\n\n*(d)* To interview or to request information from other members of the College community, alumni, and persons off campus, as it deems necessary.\n\n_(e)_ To request letters of recommendation from current students and from recent graduates who have taken at least one course from the person under review. The Reappointments Committee will request letters from at least three students and at least three alumni in all reviews. Students may be asked to comment specifically on the particular criteria for teaching listed under Evaluation of Teaching, above.\n\n*(f)* To request a letter from the department chair evaluating the candidate's scholarly activity, promise of achievement, and teaching, and assessing the candidate's role in the long-term patterns of the department.\n\n*(g)* To request a letter from the program director, when relevant, evaluating the candidate's scholarly activity, promise of achievement, and teaching, and assessing the candidate's role in the long-term patterns of the program.\n\n*(h)* To request letters of evaluation from other tenured members of the candidate's department, and, when appropriate, to invite comments from tenured colleagues in other departments.\n\n*(i)* To review the scholarly materials submitted by the candidate; to read and consider such opinions of it as may be pertinent, such as reviews or reports of readers.\n\n*(j)* To examine all the materials submitted to the committee in the case, and all other materials that may be pertinent to the review, including letters from other colleagues at Middlebury, letters from students and alumni, and others.\n\n*(k)* To read and consider the course response forms.\n\n_(l)_ To keep written records of all interviews.\n\n_(m)_ In any case where the committee determines that a departmental recommendation requires further clarification, or when the Reappointments Committee is inclined to reject the departmental recommendation, to interview the department chair, and, if the Reappointments Committee so chooses, any other tenured member or members of the department/program the Reappointments Committee deems appropriate; in either or each instance to place a written summary of the meeting(s) in the candidate's file.\n\n*(n)* To convey to the provost the committee's conclusions about the constituent considerations of the review, a final recommendation and the reasons for it. To record its final recommendation and make it a part of the review file.\n\n*(o)* In the case that the Reappointments Committee does not recommend reappointment, to explain to the provost the reasons for doing so, and to include this document in the review file.\n\n*(p)* To hear and respond to any conclusions of the provost that may differ from their own.

Nothing stated in the summary, or in the course of the review, carries with it any presumption about the outcome of any subsequent review. Similarly, the findings and recommendations of the Reappointments Committee at this review are not determinative of any assessment of the candidate's professional development at a later review. At all reviews, the Reappointments Committee or Promotions Committee makes an independent determination governed only by the standards for reappointment, promotion, and tenure as then published in the College's Rules of Appointment and Tenure, with which faculty members are expected to be familiar.\"\n\n*(r)* In the case of unsuccessful review, to offer to meet with the candidate for the same purpose.\n\n_iii.

Review for Tenure**\n\nThe review for tenure examines a faculty member for evidence of exceptional quality in teaching, and of significant scholarship or artistic achievement recognized as such by scholars and artists beyond Middlebury College. The evaluation of scholarship includes the assessment by the candidate, members of the candidate's department, members of the candidate's program (when relevant), other faculty colleagues, and appropriate professionals in the field outside Middlebury. Beyond teaching and scholarship, the service roles played by the individual faculty member will be examined.\n\nThe long-term institutional commitment to an individual's career that is made with the granting of tenure comes with the expectation of a demonstrable reciprocal commitment on the part of the faculty member to the departmental and College curricula and to the broader life of the institution.\n\n_i.

Contract Reviews**\n\nA contract review concentrates on promise and performance as a teacher and, in the case of Special Appointment faculty undergoing a review for promotion to Associate Professor (without tenure) or Associate Laboratory Professor, on service and scholarship and/or pedagogical innovation. Among the information considered by the Reappointments Committee, the departmental or programmatic evaluation will be accorded the greatest weight; however, the Reappointments Committee will also review course materials, and course response forms, and will consider the composition and long-term needs of the department or program and the faculty in arriving at its final recommendation. In the case of Special Appointment faculty undergoing a review for promotion to Associate Professor (without tenure) or Associate Laboratory Professor, the Reappointments Committee will also examine evidence for scholarship and/or pedagogical innovation. The review will follow the procedures in 3.f.i. through 3.f.vii. below.\n\nWhen a candidate on a term appointment may be renewed, and the Educational Affairs Committee has authorized a continuation of the position held, the candidates' performance in teaching, as the teaching responsibilities are defined by the position held, will be reviewed. The review will follow the procedures in 3.f.i. through 3.f.vii. below, except that expectations for performance in teaching will rise as the candidate becomes more senior in service.\n\nSpecial Appointment faculty holding positions of 0.5 FTE or greater who have had two successful Contract Reviews may request that a subsequent review include consideration of promotion to Associate Professor (without tenure) or Associate Laboratory Professor, as appropriate. In that case, the Reappointments Committee will also consider service to the institution and scholarship and/or pedagogical innovation as a component of the review. Excellence in teaching will remain the sole criterion for reappointment, but candidates who have completed significant service to the institution, as defined in subsection 2.d. and who have established a clear record of significant scholarly activity and/or pedagogical innovation may be recommended for promotion to Associate Professor (without tenure) or Associate Laboratory Professor. In the event that the record of scholarly activity and/or pedagogical innovation is not deemed  adequate for promotion, but the record of teaching excellence is deemed appropriate for reappointment, the faculty member will be reappointed as Assistant Professor (non-tenure-track) or Assistant Laboratory Professor.\n\nA candidate on visiting appointment with a title normally associated with a regular appointment (e.g., Visiting Assistant Professor) may be renewed, but only up to a maximum of three years in that position. After that point, at the time of renewal the position will be converted to the appropriate level Special Appointment (e.g., Associate Professor, non-tenure-track).\n\n_<a name=\"contract_responsibilities\" id=\"contract_responsibilities\"></a>i. The Candidate_\n\n*(a)* To arrange with the chair or director, or the chair's or director's designate, an appropriate schedule of classroom visits.\n\n*(b)* If the candidate so desires, to invite other colleagues to visit classes.\n\n_(c)_ To submit to the department chair and to the Promotions Committee in a timely manner a complete vita, course syllabi, and other materials requested, as well as materials that the candidate thinks pertinent. For example, a faculty member may request the inclusion of personal comments or other materials with the course response forms which they believe may be useful in the interpretation of the forms. To submit to the program director, when relevant, a complete vita, syllabi from relevant courses, and an example of scholarly work.\n\n*(d)* To prepare and submit to the Reappointments Committee a self-evaluation, concentrating particularly on teaching with reference to the criteria listed in 2.b. above. For reviews of faculty appointed as Associate Professor (without tenure) or Associate Laboratory Professor or those reviews associated with a request to be appointed as Associate Professor (without tenure) or Associate Laboratory Professor, the self-evaluation should also address the candidate's activity in scholarship and/or pedagogical innovation.\n\n_ii. Reappointments Committee_\n\n*(a)* To meet with the candidates undergoing contract reviews, in a group or individually, to explain to them the procedures and to invite the candidates to submit, either orally or in writing, any additional information that may be pertinent to their reviews. A candidate's decision not to submit such materials is in no way prejudicial to reappointment.\n\n*(b)* To interview or to request information from other members of the College community, alumni, and persons off campus, as it deems necessary.\n\n*(c)* To examine all the materials submitted to the committee in the case, and all other materials that may be pertinent to the review, including letters from other colleagues at Middlebury, and letters from students, alumni, or appropriate professionals outside Middlebury.\n\n*(d)* To read and consider the course response forms.\n\n*(e)* To make visits to a candidate's classes or public lectures or performances if the committee deems it appropriate to do so, and in the case of classroom visits, to make arrangements in advance. (Commentary on teaching will not be offered by members of the Reappointments Committee if visits are made.)\n\n_(f)_ To keep written records of all interviews.\n\n_(g)_ In any case where the committee determines that a departmental or programmatic recommendation requires further clarification, or when the Reappointments Committee is inclined to reject the departmental or programmatic recommendation, to interview the department chair or program director, and, if the Reappointments Committee so chooses, any other tenured member or members of the department or program the Reappointments Committee deems appropriate; in either or each instance to place a written summary of the meeting(s) in the candidate's file.\n\n_(h)_ To convey to the provost the committee's conclusions about the constituent considerations of the review, a final recommendation and the reasons for it. To record its final recommendation and make it a part of the review file. In the case of reviews associated with a request to be appointed as Associate Professor (without tenure) or Associate Laboratory Professor, the committee will make recommendations about both the renewal and the appointment as Associate Professor (without tenure) or Associate Laboratory Professor. A candidate for review who has met the teaching criteria for reappointment but has not demonstrated significant scholarly activity and/or pedagogical innovation will be reappointed as Assistant Professor (non-tenure-track) or Assistant Laboratory Professor.\n\n*(i)* In the case that the Reappointments Committee does not recommend contract renewal, to explain to the provost the reasons for doing so, to prepare a written summary explaining these reasons, and to include this document in the review file.\n\n_(j)_ To hear and respond to any conclusions of the provost that may differ from their own. To review with the provost those materials that pertain directly to any area of disagreement.\n\n_(k)_ To meet with the candidate, or authorize the VPAA/DoF to meet on their behalf, within four weeks of the completion of a successful review to provide an assessment of the candidate's performance, to summarize the information on which the Reappointments Committee based its decision, and to provide the candidate and the chairperson of the candidate's department or director of the candidate's program with a written summary of the meeting prepared by the VPAA/DoF. In this meeting, the committee should interpret the views of others without revealing their names. All summaries of reappointment review meetings will begin with the following paragraph: \"The following summary of a meeting between (the candidate) and the Reappointments Committee is made available to the candidate, who has successfully passed a review for reappointment at Middlebury College, and to the candidate's department chair or program director, solely for the purpose of providing a record of the meeting held to discuss the review just completed. Nothing stated in the summary, or in the course of the review, carries with it any presumption about the outcome of any subsequent review. Similarly, the findings and recommendations of the Reappointments Committee at this review are not determinative of any assessment of the candidate's professional development at a later review. At all reviews, the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee makes an independent determination governed only by the standards for reappointment, promotion, and tenure as then published in the College's Rules of Appointment and Tenure, with which faculty members are expected to be familiar.\"\n\n*(l)* In the case of unsuccessful review, to offer to meet with the candidate for the same purpose.\n\n_iii. Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty (VPAA/DoF)_\n\n*(a)* To initiate the review, in a timely fashion, so that all necessary information and documentation may be obtained from the candidate and other sources.\n\n*(b)* To solicit information, on behalf of the Reappointments Committee, from candidates under review; to gather information from other sources when so requested by the Reappointments Committee.\n\n*(c)* To maintain the candidates' review files, including course response forms.\n\n*(d)* To serve as recording secretary of the Reappointments Committee.\n\n*(e)* To provide counsel to the Reappointments Committee during the course of its deliberations.\n\n*(f)* To provide counsel to the provost when the Reappointments Committee's deliberations are completed.\n\n*(g)* In the case that the Reappointments Committee does not recommend contract renewal, to prepare a written summary explaining to the provost the committee's reasons for doing so, and to include this document in the review file.\n\n_iv. Dean for Faculty Development and Research (DFDR)_\n\n*(a)* In the case of a review of a department chair or program director, to assume the role of chair or director for that review.\n\n_v. Department Chair or Program Director_\n\n*(a)* To arrange with the candidate an appropriate schedule of classroom visits by the chair or director or the chair's or director's designate, and to ensure that the number of visits by other colleagues does not unnecessarily disrupt the candidate's courses.\n\n*(b)* To review the candidate's course response forms, available electronically through the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty.\n\n_(c)_ To submit a letter to the Reappointments Committee containing the departmental or programmatic evaluation according to section 2.e. or 2.f. The focus of the departmental or programmatic evaluation will be upon the candidate's teaching performance and promise as a teacher and scholar. This letter will be shared with the tenured members of the department or program and the candidate undergoing the review.\n\n*(d)* To make available to the candidate a copy of the departmental or programmatic letter.\n\n_(e)_ To meet with the candidate to discuss the contents of the departmental or programmatic evaluation.\n\n_vi. Tenured Department or Program Faculty Members_\n\n_(a)_ To submit a letter of recommendation, when requested, to the Reappointments Committee, with a copy to the department chair or program director, that speaks to those aspects of a candidate's work with which he or she is familiar.

PRIOR SERVICE, EARLY REVIEW, AND LENGTH OF APPOINTMENT UNDER \"NEW\" RULES**\n\n**<a name=\"normal_review_sched\" id=\"normal_review_sched\"></a>a. Normal Review Schedules in Case of Prior Service**   \nAll regular faculty members appointed to full-time positions at any rank, who have had prior full-time appointment at another college or university, are reviewed for reappointment no later than in the third year of their Middlebury appointment.\n\nFaculty who teach less than full-time are normally reviewed after they have taught ten fall/spring courses.\n\nThe **_normal_** schedule for length of initial appointment and the character of initial review for reappointment is as follows:\n\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"115\">\n\n_Years of Prior Service_\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"156\">\n\n_Length of First Contract_\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"156\">\n\n_Initial Review_\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"163\">\n\n_Year in which review takes place_\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"115\">\n\n1-2\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"156\">\n\n3\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"156\">\n\nFirst\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"163\">\n\nThird (fall)\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"115\">\n\n3\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"156\">\n\n2\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"156\">\n\nFirst\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"163\">\n\nSecond (January)\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"115\">\n\n4\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"156\">\n\n4\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"156\">\n\nTenure\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"163\">\n\nThird (spring)\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"115\">\n\n5-7\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"156\">\n\n3\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"156\">\n\nTenure\n\n</td>\n\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"163\">\n\nSecond or third (January) as negotiated at time of appointment\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\nAny deviations from this schedule will be specifically stated in the initial letter of appointment. Prior service counts for anyone who has held a regular, full-time appointment at a senior college or university. Only full-year appointments at Middlebury or elsewhere counts toward tenure date.\n\n**<a name=\"reviews_term\" id=\"reviews_term\"></a>b. Review Schedule for Term Appointments**  \nInitial term appointments to the Middlebury College faculty may range from one to three years. Term appointments may be made at any rank, regardless of the normal phasing of reviews. Term appointments are intended to accommodate contextual needs in instructional programs or the needs of the faculty member appointed. Reappointment may be offered for periods less than the normal reappointment period when contextual needs in an instructional program require it.\n\n**<a name=\"length_appt_tenure\" id=\"length_appt_tenure\"></a>c. Length of Appointment and Tenure**  \nA faculty member with a regular full-time appointment may not serve beyond the eighth year (at Middlebury or as accumulated) without review for tenure, except when the initial term appointment carries beyond the eighth year (as accumulated). With the exceptions noted below, faculty members holding special full-time appointments may not be reappointed beyond the eighth year of full-time teaching at Middlebury College. This limitation does not apply to faculty members in the following categories as defined previously in section 1.c.ii., Faculty Appointments, Special Appointments.\n\ni. *Lecturers and Senior Lecturers*  \nii. *Assistant Professor (non-tenure-track) and Associate Professor (without tenure)*  \niii. *Assistants in Instruction*  \niv. *Laboratory Instructor, Assistant Laboratory Professor, and Associate Laboratory Professor*  \nv. _Members of the Department of Physical Education_  \nvi. *Administrative appointments with faculty rank*\n\nWhen (following a stringent review by the Reappointments Committee) a full-time faculty member is appointed beyond the eighth year, the length of the employment contract will normally be from three to five years.\n\n**<a name=\"early_review\" id=\"early_review\"></a>d. Early Reviews**  \nThe decision to be reviewed early for tenure rests with the individual faculty member. If a colleague requests an early tenure review, the Promotions Committee will review the faculty member according to the appropriate criteria for the tenure review as outlined. A faculty member electing early review waives the terms of the existing letter of appointment pertaining to length of appointment to the faculty. If the review results in a decision not to reappoint, no later review will be undertaken, and faculty members who have been denied tenure will be offered a one-year terminal appointment for the year succeeding the review. A request for an early tenure review that anticipates notification of the decision by December 15 should be received by the VPAA/DoF by May 15 prior; a request that anticipates notification by May 15 should be received by December 15 prior. Time spent on leave (except for sick or parental leave) does not alter the time of review; i.e., the timing of the review is calculated strictly from the date of first appointment, regardless of any time on leave for the purposes of scholarship and other professional development.\n\n**<a name=\"deferred_reviews\" id=\"deferred_reviews\"></a>e. Deferred Reviews**  \nFaculty members may request a delay in the tenure review. The VPAA/DoF may grant a delay if the professional development of a member of the faculty has been impaired by a particularly demanding institutional role or by poor health, family obligations, or legally recognized disabilities. In no case, however, will a tenure review take place later than the tenth year of full-time teaching.\n\n**<a name=\"notification_date\" id=\"notification_date\"></a>f. Notification Date**  \nPersons undergoing a first review will be notified of decisions no later than December 15 of their final year of appointment. Persons undergoing a tenure review will be notified of decisions no later than May 15 of the year preceding their final year of appointment. Faculty undergoing a review for promotion to full professor will be notified no later than February 15 of the review year. Faculty undergoing a ten-year review will be notified no later than June 1 of the review year. All other faculty being reviewed normally will be notified no later than February 15.\n\n**<a name=\"retire\" id=\"retire\"></a>g. Retirement**  \nRetirement may be arranged at any time a faculty member chooses. Retirements will normally become effective on the terminal date of a fiscal year. Appointment of a retired faculty member to a period of active service at Middlebury College will be at the discretion of the president.\n","excerpt":"Section Links: 1.

General Provisions</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"purpose\" id=\"purpose\"></a>a. Purpose</strong></p>\n<p>The Rules of Appointment and Tenure set forth the regulations and the procedures affecting appointments of the instructional faculty of Middlebury College. These criteria and procedures apply to the Council on Reviews (consisting of the Reappointments Committee and the Promotions Committee), to the president, the provost, and to all academic departments and programs at Middlebury College, and are the only criteria and procedures that may be required as conditions for appointment, reappointment, and promotion. Because its judgment is central to general educational policy, the faculty has primary responsibility (exercised through the Council on Reviews, academic departments and programs, and individual faculty members) to make recommendations for appointment. The president normally follows the recommendation of the Promotions Committee. The provost normally follows the recommendation of the Reappointments Committee. In cases where the president or provost does not follow the recommendation of the Promotions Committee or the Reappointments Committee, respectively, they will communicate the reasons to the appropriate committee and the reasons will be stated in the review file.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"principles\" id=\"principles\"></a>b. Principles</strong></p>\n<p><strong>i. <em>Teaching</em>.</strong> Middlebury College expects to appoint to the faculty people of exceptional promise and achievement as teachers and as scholars or artists, who will help students to grow and to develop habits of lifelong learning, critical inquiry, and lucid communication.</p>\n<p>As a residential liberal arts college, Middlebury views teaching from a broad perspective that extends beyond the activities in classrooms, laboratories, studios, and recital halls. Advising students, providing guidance for independent projects, and the careful evaluation of student work are important components of a faculty member's responsibilities. Public lectures, presentations, or performances also contribute to teaching at Middlebury.</p>\n<p><strong>ii. <em>Scholarship</em>.</strong> Middlebury believes that a faculty actively engaged in scholarship enriches the intellectual climate of the College. The mastery of new knowledge or skills, including those outside of the faculty member's own discipline, is valued as a contribution to the intellectual life of the College; however, the quality of a faculty member's scholarship is evaluated primarily through his or her published, performed, or executed works. Scholarly achievement that is recognized as of significantly high quality by scholars or artists beyond Middlebury College is a prerequisite for promotion to tenure.</p>\n<p><strong>iii. <em>Service</em>.</strong> The Middlebury faculty has a vital role to play in sustaining the intellectual climate of the College outside the classroom, in governing the College, and in extending the impact of the College beyond the bounds of the campus. Beyond teaching and scholarship, the service roles played by individual faculty members include departmental, program, and committee responsibilities, activities with student organizations, participation in admissions or alumni activities, and other activities that benefit Middlebury College.</p>\n<p><strong>iv. <em>Academic Freedom</em>.</strong> Adapted from the 1940 \"Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure\" of the American Association of University Professors:</p>\n<p><em>(a) Purposes</em>. Institutions of higher education are conducted for the common good and not to further the interests of either the individual teacher or the institution as a whole. The common good depends upon the free search for truth and its free exposition.</p>\n<p>Academic freedom is essential to these purposes and applies to both teaching and research. Freedom in research is fundamental to the advancement of truth. Academic freedom in its teaching aspect is fundamental for the protection of the rights of the teacher in teaching and of the student to freedom in learning. It carries with it duties correlative with rights.</p>\n<p>Tenure is a means to certain ends; specifically: (1) freedom of teaching and research and of extramural activities and (2) a sufficient degree of economic security to make the profession attractive to men and women of ability. Freedom and economic security, hence, tenure, are indispensable to the success of an institution in fulfilling its obligations to its students and to society.</p>\n<p><em>(b) Principles.</em> The teacher is entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of his or her other academic duties; but research for pecuniary return should be based upon an understanding with the authorities of the institution.</p>\n<p>The teacher is entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing his or her subject, but should be careful not to introduce into his or her teaching controversial matter which has no relation to the subject. Limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the institution should be clearly stated in writing at the time of the appointment.</p>\n<p>College or university teachers are citizens, members of learned professions, and officers of an educational institution. In speaking or writing as citizens, they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline, but their special position in the community imposes special obligations. As persons of learning and educational officers, they should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances. Hence, they should at all times be accurate, should exercise appropriate restraint, should show respect for the opinions of others, and should make every effort to indicate that they are not institutional spokespeople.</p>\n<p>Consistent with AAUP’s 1940 “Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure” and its subsequent amendments, all members of the Middlebury College faculty are entitled to full academic freedom described above regardless of race, color, ethnicity, sex, religion, national origin, age, disability, marital status, place of birth, veteran status, gender identity and expression, or sexual orientation.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"faculty_appts\" id=\"faculty_appts\"></a>c. Faculty Appointments</strong></p>\n<p><strong>i. <em>Regular and Term Appointments</em></strong>. Both term and regular appointments may be offered at any faculty rank. Regular appointments are renewable and subject to the Review and Reappointment procedures described in subsections 1.e. and 1.f. below. Faculty on regular appointment normally pass through a probationary period whose length may vary with prior service elsewhere, during that time undergoing one or more reviews that will evaluate, both for the faculty member and for the College, the progress they have made in developing the qualities that may lead to appointment without limit of tenure.</p>\n<p>Term appointments are either for specified terms only, or renewable, but faculty on term appointments are not eligible for tenure. Whether a faculty position is to be a regular or term appointment shall be determined by the provost, with the advice of the Educational Affairs Committee, prior to the filling of the position. Any change from a term to a regular appointment must be initiated by the appropriate department chair, recommended by the EAC, and approved by the provost. A faculty member who holds a regular Middlebury faculty appointment cannot be appointed after the first review to a full-time faculty position outside of rank. Faculty appointments are considered to be in rank when they use the following titles:</p>\n<p><em>(a) Instructor:</em> Normal rank for faculty who have not completed the Ph.D. degree or equivalent terminal degree. The completion of the degree normally leads to promotion to Assistant Professor without a review by the Council on Reviews.</p>\n<p><em>(b) Assistant Professor:</em> Normal rank for faculty who have completed a terminal degree, but who have not been reviewed for and appointed to tenure.</p>\n<p><em>(c) Associate Professor:</em> Normal rank for first appointment with tenure, or whose initial appointment, based on accomplishment elsewhere, is at the rank of associate professor.</p>\n<p><em>(d) Professor:</em> The rank awarded to faculty who have passed the post-tenure review described in 1.f.iv. below, or whose initial appointment, based on accomplishment elsewhere, is at the rank of professor.</p>\n<p><strong>ii. <em>Special Appointments</em></strong>. Individuals with special appointments normally do not follow the schedule of reviews and promotions of regular faculty. Special appointments are assigned one of the faculty titles below. Special appointments may be within or outside of rank, do not carry tenure, and are not subject to the review and reappointment procedures described in subsection 1.e. However, faculty members on renewable special appointment are subject to periodic Contract Reviews by the Reappointments Committee, as specified in subsection 3.f., below.</p>\n<p><em>(a) Lecturer and Senior Lecturer:</em> Renewable full- or part-time term appointments to fulfill specialized teaching responsibilities. Lecturers are not required to have a terminal degree. After at least nine years of consecutive service and following a successful Contract Review, Lecturers will be reappointed as Senior Lecturers.</p>\n<p><em>(b) Assistant Professor (non-tenure-track):</em> Multi-year appointments of two to five years in length with less than full-time teaching responsibilities. Faculty appointed to this rank must have a terminal degree. Those individuals hired at this rank who are ABD will initially be appointed as Instructor. For those on two-year contracts, the department or program will normally request an increase to at least a three-year contract if it requests a second renewal. For those on three-year contracts, the department or program will normally request an increase to a five-year contract if it requests a second renewal.</p>\n<p><em>(c) Associate Professor (without tenure):</em> Faculty appointed as Assistant Professor (non-tenure-track) may be promoted to Associate Professor (without tenure) after at least two successful contract reviews, as described in subsection 3.f. below, and at least six years of consecutive service.</p>\n<p><em>(d) Assistant in Instruction:</em> Full- or part-time renewable term appointments to fulfill specialized teaching functions associated with courses. Assistants in Instruction serve as teaching assistants, work one-on-one with students, and/or provide technical support for student work.</p>\n<p><em>(e) Laboratory Instructor:</em> Full- or part-time renewable term appointments to fulfill specialized teaching functions associated with the laboratory components of courses. Laboratory Instructors have full responsibility for teaching and curriculum design of laboratory sections. Laboratory Instructors must have an advanced degree, but do not have a terminal degree.</p>\n<p><em>(f) Assistant Laboratory Professor:</em> Full- or part-time renewable term appointments to fulfill specialized teaching functions associated with the laboratory components of courses. Assistant Laboratory Professors have full responsibility for teaching and curriculum design of laboratory sections. Assistant Laboratory Professors must have a terminal degree.</p>\n<p><em>(g) Associate Laboratory Professor:</em> Full-or part-time renewable term appointments to fulfill specialized teaching functions associate with the laboratory components of courses. Faculty appointed as Assistant Laboratory Professor may be promoted to Associate Laboratory Professor after at least two successful contract reviews, as described in subsection 3.f. below, and at least six years of consecutive service. Associate Laboratory Professors must have a terminal degree.</p>\n<p><em>(h) Visiting Appointments:</em> Visiting appointments are full- or part-time term appointments that may be offered to faculty for no more than three years. At the conclusion of the term of the visiting appointment, it may be converted to a new renewable contract or regular appointment under the provisions specified above.</p>\n<p><em>(i) Adjunct Appointments:</em> Adjunct appointments are part-time term appointments that may be made at any adjunct title and may be renewed. Adjunct appointments normally are offered to individuals whose major professional responsibilities lie outside teaching.</p>\n<p><em>(j) Physical Education:</em> Faculty in the Department of Physical Education receive renewable term appointments in rank, and are subject to the review procedures as outlined in the contiguous section \"Reviews for Physical Education Faculty\".   Physical Education Faculty appointments are considered as such when they use the following titles:</p>\n<p>i. Instructor in Physical Education – This is the normal starting rank for coaches who have limited coaching background.  Term contracts are issued for one or two years.</p>\n<p>ii. Assistant in Physical Education – This is the normal rank for Head Coaches and Program Directors, who possess significant coaching and/or program experience.  A Master's degree is preferred, (but not required). The rank is granted to coaches who show the promise of superior coaching and teaching ability based on previous coaching and/or program experience. Coaches in this rank will generally be offered a three-year contract, and upon successful reviews, a second three-year contract.</p>\n<p>iii. Associate in Physical Education – This is the normal rank for coaching faculty who have demonstrated superior coaching and teaching ability, and after a major review are appointed to a renewable five-year contract. A Master's degree is preferred.</p>\n<p>iv. Senior Associate in Physical Education – This is the rank awarded to coaching faculty who have undergone a major contract review during the tenth year as an Associate and continue to demonstrate superior coaching and teaching ability. A faculty member with a Senior Contract will be granted a renewable seven-year contract.</p>\n<p><em>(f) Administrative Appointments:</em> Senior College administrators whose major professional responsibilities are in support of the instructional program may be granted faculty rank.</p>\n<p><strong>iii. <em>Associate Appointments</em></strong>. Associate appointments are regular faculty appointments in rank which normally carry no more than one-half the normal College teaching responsibility. Associates have all the rights, responsibilities, and privileges of their rank, including tenure for associates at the rank of associate professor or professor. (See section a. in <em>Special Provisions of Appointment</em> for procedures and conditions.)</p>\n<p><strong>iv. <em>Appointments and Voting Rights</em></strong>. All faculty on regular appointment, regular faculty on associate status, senior College administrators with faculty rank, and full-time and part-time teaching faculty on special appointment, except for adjunct faculty, may vote.</p>\n<p><strong>v. <em>Appointments and Committee Assignments</em></strong>. Faculty members on regular, full-time special appointment, or associate appointment are eligible for assignment or election to all faculty committees and councils, provided all conditions for membership are met. All faculty members are expected to fulfill normal advising and administrative responsibilities.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"procedure_appt\" id=\"procedure_appt\"></a>d. Procedures of Appointment</strong></p>\n<p><strong>i. <em>New appointments</em></strong>. New appointments are made by the president or the president's designate in accordance with the authority vested in them by the Board of Trustees. New appointments, reappointments, and promotions are reported by the president to the board at its regular meetings.</p>\n<p>In considering appointment to the faculty of a person not already serving on it, the president will solicit the advice of the chair of the department concerned and such other advice and recommendation as they may deem appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>ii.</strong> Offer of appointment or reappointment to the faculty will in all cases be tendered in writing and shall include a statement of precise terms and conditions of appointment and status of appointment with respect to tenure, and in the Department of Physical Education and Athletics with respect to contract terms.  For a person already serving on the faculty, such offer will be extended early enough to be in their hand no later than the notification date as specified below in 4.f., Notification Date.</p>\n<p><strong>iii.</strong> Acceptance of appointment likewise will be tendered in writing. In the case of a person already serving on the faculty, such written acceptance or rejection shall be returned not more than 15 days after the notification date. Some extension of this period may be permitted by the president or the president's designate upon specific request in an exceptional case.</p>\n<p><strong>iv.</strong> Notice of non-reappointment of a person serving on the faculty will be given in writing no later than the notification date as specified below in 4.f., Notification Date. Such notice shall be deemed to have been given if the appointment upon which the person concerned is then serving was specifically stated to be a terminal appointment.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"review_reappt\" id=\"review_reappt\"></a>e. Review and Reappointment</strong></p>\n<p><strong>i. <em>Review schedule</em></strong>. Faculty on regular appointment whose first full-time appointment is at Middlebury are reviewed in the third year of appointment. Those who are reappointed following the first review will normally be reviewed for tenure in the spring of the seventh year after initial appointment. A request for early review that anticipates notification by December 15 or February 15 should be received by the Promotions Committee by May 15 prior; a request that anticipates notification by May 15 should be received by December 15 prior.</p>\n<p><strong>ii. <em>First Review</em></strong>. In the third year of appointment to the faculty, unless there is credit for prior service, the Reappointments Committee undertakes a thorough review of the faculty member for evidence of accomplishment in teaching, scholarly or creative activity, and promise of outstanding teaching and developing scholarly or artistic achievement appropriate to the year in which the review takes place. The composition and long-term needs of the department and the faculty will also be considered. The procedures to be followed for the first review are set forth below.</p>\n<p>The Reappointments Committee will arrange a meeting with successful first review candidates within one month of the review. The only persons present will be the candidate, the Reappointments Committee, and the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty (VPAA/DoF), as secretary to the Reappointments Committee.</p>\n<p><strong>iii.</strong> <strong><em>Post Review Consultation</em></strong>. After passing the first review and within a month after the obligatory meeting between the Reappointments Committee and the faculty member, the dean for faculty development and research (DFDR) shall arrange a meeting with the faculty member and the department chair to discuss the development of the faculty member's career from the perspectives of both the individual and the department chair. The procedures for these interviews are set forth below.</p>\n<p><strong>iv. <em>Appointments Following a Negative Review</em></strong>. Faculty who, having undergone review for tenure, are denied reappointment shall be offered a one-year terminal appointment, but in no case will such appointment extend beyond the academic year following the year of the review. No person who has failed a review and left the Middlebury Faculty may be considered for any appointment to the Faculty.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"promote_tenure\" id=\"promote_tenure\"></a>f. Promotion to Tenure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>i. <em>Institutional Assumptions Regarding Promotion to Tenure</em></strong>. The granting of tenure, whether with or without promotion in rank, is recommended by the president to the Board of Trustees or its designated committee or subcommittee for approval. The College expects to appoint to tenure faculty who are of exceptional quality as teachers and who are scholars or artists of significant achievement as recognized by the broader academic community beyond Middlebury. Such long-term institutional commitment to an individual's career comes with the expectation of a demonstrable reciprocal commitment by the faculty member to the departmental and College curricula and to the broader life of the institution. College involvement cannot compensate for an absence of scholarly or creative achievement, but its presence must be considered as the institution assesses tenurability. Tenure reviews will be based solely on the performance of the candidate, without regard to numerical quotas.</p>\n<p>Procedures for the review for tenure are set forth below.</p>\n<p><strong>ii.</strong> <strong><em>Tenure</em></strong>. Appointment as associate professor or professor, after the passing of a Review for Tenure, is normally without limit of time (to normal retirement). Faculty at these ranks are regarded by the College as having tenure. Because Middlebury is primarily a teaching institution, there is an expectation of continued dedication to and high performance in teaching, in addition to an expectation of continuing achievement in scholarship and of service to the College.</p>\n<p><strong>iii.</strong> <strong><em>Initial Appointment with Tenure.</em></strong> Initial appointment to the Middlebury faculty at the rank of professor or associate professor with tenure shall be made by the president after consultation with the provost and the Promotions Committee and with the approval of the Board of Trustees. The Promotions Committee shall apply the same criteria in these appointments when advising the president and provost as in those from within the College. Such appointments will be rare and made only for appointees of exceptional qualifications.</p>\n<p><strong>iv. <em>Review for Promotion to Professor</em></strong>. Associate professors are first reviewed by the Promotions Committee at a time of their choosing, no earlier than the fifth and no later than the tenth year (eighth year for faculty tenured prior to 2011) following appointment to tenure, for possible promotion to professor. This review is regarded as an opportunity for reassessment of professional achievements, and the basis for promotion will be evidence of continued excellence in teaching, achievement in scholarship, and service to the institution. Should the faculty member not be promoted, a similar review will be conducted at intervals of the faculty member's choosing, no earlier than three and no later than five years following the unsuccessful review until the faculty member has been promoted to professor or has departed from the faculty. When initial appointment to the Middlebury faculty is at the rank of associate professor with tenure, the date of review for promotion to the rank of professor shall be determined at the time of appointment and stated in the letter of appointment.</p>\n<p>Procedures for the promotion review are set forth below.</p>\n<p><strong>v. <em>Ten-year review</em></strong>. In the tenth year after promotion to full professor and every ten years thereafter, each full professor will undergo a professional review by the Reappointments Committee. The review has two goals: to assess professional achievements since promotion to full professor (or since the last ten-year review) and to aid in formulating plans for further growth and development.</p>\n<p>As a result of the review, the vice president for Academic Affairs/dean of the faculty (VPAA/DoF) may choose to recognize unusually distinguished service or consider action with respect to problems that have become apparent during the review. The VPAA/DoF will also discuss with the faculty member under review ways in which the College might help that person attain his or her goals for professional growth. Within the limits of its financial means, and in the interest of continuing faculty development, the College will attempt to offer leave opportunities to faculty members shortly after the ten-year review.</p>\n<p>Procedures for the ten-year review are set forth below.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"review_procedures\" id=\"review_procedures\"></a>2. Review Procedures</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"review_purpose\" id=\"review_purpose\"></a>a. Purpose</strong></p>\n<p>The review procedures complement the Rules of Reappointment and Tenure by enumerating the responsibilities of all parties charged with conducting a review for reappointment, tenure, or promotion to full professor.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"review_eval_teach\" id=\"review_eval_teach\"></a>b. Evaluation of Teaching</strong></p>\n<p><strong>i. <em>Criteria</em></strong>. Evaluation of teaching effectiveness includes an assessment by oneself and by one's peers, and the evaluations by students. In no case will evaluation of teaching be based solely on course response forms. Teaching should be taken in its broad sense, to include not only formal classroom work, but also the candidate's contributions to the curriculum, advising, and other teaching outside the classroom. Nonetheless, evaluation will always include observation of classroom teaching <em>(see Classroom Visits below).</em></p>\n<p>Criteria considered for evaluation of teaching will include:</p>\n<p><em>(a)</em> overall quality of the learning experience provided to students;</p>\n<p><em>(b)</em> effectiveness in promoting student thinking and learning;</p>\n<p><em>(c)</em> quality of classroom instruction;</p>\n<p><em>(d)</em> organization of courses;</p>\n<p><em>(e)</em> availability and helpfulness to students;</p>\n<p><em>(f)</em> care in evaluating student work;</p>\n<p><em>(g)</em> ability to teach a broad range of students; and</p>\n<p><em>(h)</em> teaching outside the classroom.</p>\n<p><strong>ii. <em>Course Response Forms</em>.</strong> Faculty members will receive a pdf of their course response forms via email following the end of the term and after all grades have been submitted.  Faculty member's course response forms are stored electronically on a secure server with the Office of Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty, where they may be consulted only by the president, the provost, the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty, the department chair, and the Reappointments Committee or Promotions Committee. Program directors will have access to all course response forms for courses taught with an explicit program label, either as a standalone or cross-listed course.  . A faculty member may request the addition of personal comments or other materials  with the course response forms which they believe may be useful in the interpretation of the forms.  Faculty members must share their personal copies of course response forms with colleagues writing on their behalf. The VPAA/DoF cannot grant access to electronic files to anyone other than those listed above. All course response forms are kept until the faculty member is reviewed for tenure. After the tenure review, CRFs five years and older will be deleted.</p>\n<p>Faculty who have completed the equivalent of two years of full-time teaching may designate one course every two years as \"CRF-optional\". In these cases, those forms are held separately and not uploaded to the server. The faculty member may then decide whether to include the forms in their file held by the administration.</p>\n<p><strong>iii. <em>Classroom Visits</em></strong>. In the semester preceding the term in which the review takes place, the candidate should arrange with the department chair an appropriate schedule of class visits over the two terms. The chair (or a senior member of the department designated by the chair and acceptable to the candidate) will visit at least two classes. Other colleagues may visit classes if the candidate invites them. It is the responsibility of the chair to ensure that the visits are not unnecessarily disruptive. Following classroom visits, and before the end of the term during which the visits take place, if the candidate wishes it, each visiting colleague will meet with the individual being evaluated to discuss his or her performance in the classes visited and to make suggestions for possible improvement. Members of the Reappointments Committee or Promotions Committee, however, will not normally offer such commentaries. In all cases, which classes will be visited will be agreed on in advance by the candidate and the visitors.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"review_eval_scholarship\" id=\"review_eval_scholarship\"></a>c. Evaluation of Scholarship</strong></p>\n<p>A candidate's scholarship or artistic production is considered in terms of activity and of achievement.</p>\n<p><em>Scholarly activity</em> represents a pattern of related professional involvements, which may include: research and experimentation; writing, analyzing, creating; presentations to peers or to the public; responsible roles in professional organizations; visiting professorships; applying for and receiving outside grants and fellowships; and developing new fields of expertise.</p>\n<p><em>Scholarly achievement</em> is the result of that activity, primarily as evidenced in work that has been (a) performed, executed, or published (as original research communicated to specialists or as the synthesis and interpretation of scholarly material for a more general audience), and (b) recognized as being of significantly high quality by scholars and artists within the broader academic community beyond Middlebury College.</p>\n<p>Evaluation is undertaken by colleagues and by other appropriate professionals in the candidate's field. In reviews for tenure and for full professor (not required for faculty who were awarded tenure prior to 2011), scholars from outside the College will be asked to judge the candidate's scholarship. Evaluators will be supplied with the Handbook description of the scholarly activity and achievement appropriate to the review in question and will be asked to evaluate it on that basis.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"review_eval_service\" id=\"review_eval_service\"></a>d. Evaluation of Service</strong></p>\n<p>Institutional service becomes a criterion for evaluation along with teaching and scholarship at the tenure review and at the review for promotion to professor. It may be as diverse in form as is the faculty itself. Information regarding such service will be solicited from the candidates, from their departments, from their programs (when relevant), and through collegial letters for assessment by the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee.</p>\n<p>College service cannot compensate for an absence of achievement in teaching and scholarly or creative production. Nevertheless, the College recognizes that on occasion it must call upon an untenured faculty member to undertake a particularly demanding institutional role that may impede scholarly progress. At the time of such an appointment, the untenured faculty member may request that the VPAA/DoF, in consultation with the Promotions Committee, give written permission for a one-year postponement of the tenure review to permit additional time for scholarly achievement.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"dept_eval\" id=\"dept_eval\"></a>e. Departmental Evaluation</strong></p>\n<p>The department letter is written by the chair. This letter will state the chair's judgment concerning the candidate's fitness for reappointment, tenure, or promotion and the reasons for it. In preparing this recommendation, the chair will conduct two or more classroom visits for reappointment and tenure reviews, one or more visits for post-tenure reviews, review the candidate's course response forms and other materials submitted to the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee for review, as well as the written recommendations of the tenured members of the department or of full professors when the review is for promotion to professor. The chair also will present, in the departmental letter, an accurate summary of the views, without attribution, of the senior members of the department.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"program_eval\" id=\"program_eval\"></a>f. Program Director's Evaluation</strong></p>\n<p>A program director will submit a letter of programmatic evaluation in faculty reviews if and only if (i) programmatic involvement is explicitly stated in the letter of appointment; or (ii) the faculty member under review requests that the VPAA/DoF solicit a letter from the appropriate program director. This letter will state the director's judgment concerning the candidate's fitness for reappointment, tenure, or promotion and the reasons for it. The VPAA/DoF will solicit letters from at least two other senior members of the program, whom the program director selects in consultation with the candidate under review. The program director will provide the faculty member under review the names of these senior members. These letters will go to the program director and to the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee. In preparing the program letter, the director will review the candidate's vita; syllabi from relevant courses; an example of scholarly work; when the candidate has taught a course with an explicit program label, the course response forms from those courses; and, when relevant, the written recommendations of the solicited program members. The director will also present, in the programmatic letter, an accurate summary of the views, without attribution, of any senior members of the program who have been solicited to write letters. In cases where a program is based entirely within a department, the program director will write an individual letter that will go to the department chair and to the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee. The department chair will summarize the views of the program director in the departmental letter. In such instances, the program director's letter will not be made available to the candidate.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"confidentiality\" id=\"confidentiality\"></a>g. Confidentiality and Access</strong></p>\n<p>Letters from students and alumni are always confidential. Letters from outside evaluators are always confidential. Letters from colleagues at Middlebury are made available to candidates only in the event of a decision to deny reappointment. Restricting access is meant to ensure frank and honest assessments of the candidates. The letters should be accurate in matters of fact upon which judgments are based. The departmental letter (i.e., the letter written by a chair that summarizes, without attribution, the views of tenured colleagues) will be made available to the candidate at the time when it is submitted to the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee. If a program letter is written, it will also be made available to the candidate at the time when it is submitted to the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee. Any response to the departmental or programmatic letter that the candidate wishes to submit to the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee must be submitted to the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee and made available to the department chair or program director within two weeks of the receipt of the chair's or director's letter. Any further letters of response, either from the chair, the director, or the candidate, will be held in confidence by the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee.</p>\n<p>The VPAA/DoF, the president, the provost, and members of the Reappointments Committee or the Promotions Committee will have access to all materials submitted in connection with a review. The department chair will have access to letters from other senior members of the department and to the candidate's vita, publications, and course response forms. The program director will have access to solicited letters from other senior members of the program and to the candidate's vita, relevant syllabi, an example of scholarship, and, when the candidate has taught a course with an explicit program label, course response forms from those courses.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"procedures_responsibilities\" id=\"procedures_responsibilities\"></a>3. Procedures and Responsibilities</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em><a name=\"firstr\" id=\"firstr\"></a>a. First Review</em></strong></p>\n<p>The first review examines a faculty member's performance for evidence of accomplishment in teaching, of scholarly or creative activity, and of promise of outstanding teaching and scholarly or artistic achievement of significant quality. The evaluation of scholarship includes the assessment of the candidate, members of the candidate's department, and other faculty colleagues. The composition and long-term needs of the department and the faculty are also considered in this review.</p>\n<p><em>i. The Candidate</em></p>\n<p><em>(a)</em> Candidates are expected to have completed the requirements for the terminal degree. Failure to complete the terminal degree (normally the Ph.D.) by the time of the first review creates the presumption that the criterion of scholarly activity has not been satisfied. This presumption can be rebutted only by strong evidence (1) that the required written or artistic work is completed, but not yet defended, or (2) that there is other scholarly achievement of exceptionally high quality.</p>\n<p><em>(b)</em> To arrange with the chair, or the chair's designate, an appropriate schedule of classroom visits.</p>\n<p><em>(c)</em> If the candidate so desires, to invite other colleagues to visit classes.</p>\n<p><em>(d)</em> To submit to the department chair and to the Reappointments Committee in a timely manner a complete vita, course syllabi, and other materials requested, as well as materials that the candidate thinks pertinent. For example, a faculty member may request the inclusion of personal comments or other materials with the course response forms which they believe may be useful in the interpretation of the forms.  To submit to the program director, when relevant, a complete vita, syllabi from relevant courses, and an example of scholarly work.</p>\n<p><em>(e)</em> To submit to the Reappointments Committee scholarly publications, a dissertation, and/or other appropriate evidence of scholarship or artistic activity.</p>\n<p><em>(f)</em> To arrange with members of the Reappointments Committee an appropriate schedule of classroom visits.</p>\n<p><em>(g)</em> To prepare a self-evaluation that concentrates on teaching performance and scholarly activity with reference to the criteria listed in 2.b. and 2.c. above. The evaluation of scholarly activity should project a program leading to a level of scholarly achievement suitable for tenure. The letter may include identification of any factors that have hindered progress.</p>\n<p><em>ii. Reappointments Committee</em></p>\n<p><em>(a)</em> To meet with the candidates for the first review, in a group or individually, to explain to them the procedures; and to invite the candidates to submit, either orally or in writing, any additional information that may be pertinent to their reviews. A candidate's decision not to submit such materials is in no way prejudicial to reappointment.</p>\n<p><em>(b)</em> To have one of its members serve as a liaison to the faculty member during the review and to meet with the faculty member early in the term of the review, and later during that term if necessary or if requested by the candidate to explain the procedures for the review, answer any questions, and receive additional information the candidate considers pertinent to the review.</p>\n<p><em>(c)</em> To arrange with the candidate an appropriate schedule of classroom visits. At least two members should each visit at least two of the candidate's classes, or one class and one public lecture. Additional classroom visits may be scheduled as deemed necessary by the committee. (Commentary on teaching will not be offered by members of the Reappointments Committee.)</p>\n<p><em>(d)</em> To interview or to request information from other members of the College community, alumni, and persons off campus, as it deems necessary.</p>\n<p><em>(e)</em> To request letters of recommendation from current students and from recent graduates who have taken at least one course from the person under review. The Reappointments Committee will request letters from at least three students and at least three alumni in all reviews. Students may be asked to comment specifically on the particular criteria for teaching listed under Evaluation of Teaching, above.</p>\n<p><em>(f)</em> To request a letter from the department chair evaluating the candidate's scholarly activity, promise of achievement, and teaching, and assessing the candidate's role in the long-term patterns of the department.</p>\n<p><em>(g)</em> To request a letter from the program director, when relevant, evaluating the candidate's scholarly activity, promise of achievement, and teaching, and assessing the candidate's role in the long-term patterns of the program.</p>\n<p><em>(h)</em> To request letters of evaluation from other tenured members of the candidate's department, and, when appropriate, to invite comments from tenured colleagues in other departments.</p>\n<p><em>(i)</em> To review the scholarly materials submitted by the candidate; to read and consider such opinions of it as may be pertinent, such as reviews or reports of readers.</p>\n<p><em>(j)</em> To examine all the materials submitted to the committee in the case, and all other materials that may be pertinent to the review, including letters from other colleagues at Middlebury, letters from students and alumni, and others.</p>\n<p><em>(k)</em> To read and consider the course response forms.</p>\n<p><em>(l)</em> To keep written records of all interviews.</p>\n<p><em>(m)</em> In any case where the committee determines that a departmental recommendation requires further clarification, or when the Reappointments Committee is inclined to reject the departmental recommendation, to interview the department chair, and, if the Reappointments Committee so chooses, any other tenured member or members of the department/program the Reappointments Committee deems appropriate; in either or each instance to place a written summary of the meeting(s) in the candidate's file.</p>\n<p><em>(n)</em> To convey to the provost the committee's conclusions about the constituent considerations of the review, a final recommendation and the reasons for it. To record its final recommendation and make it a part of the review file.</p>\n<p><em>(o)</em> In the case that the Reappointments Committee does not recommend reappointment, to explain to the provost the reasons for doing so, and to include this document in the review file.</p>\n<p><em>(p)</em> To hear and respond to any conclusions of the provost that may differ from their own. To review with the provost those materials that pertain directly to any area of disagreement.</p>\n<p><em>(q)</em> To meet with the candidate within four weeks of the completion of a successful review to provide an assessment of the candidate's performance, to summarize the information on which the Reappointments Committee based its decision, and to provide the candidate and the chairperson of the candidate's department with a written summary of the meeting prepared by the VPAA/DoF. In this meeting, the committee should interpret the views of others without revealing their names. All summaries of reappointment review meetings will begin with the following paragraph: \"The following summary of a meeting between (the candidate) and the Reappointments Committee is made available to the candidate, who has successfully passed a review for reappointment at Middlebury College, and to the candidate's department chair, solely for the purpose of providing a record of the meeting held to discuss the review just completed. Nothing stated in the summary, or in the course of the review, carries with it any presumption about the outcome of any subsequent review. Similarly, the findings and recommendations of the Reappointments Committee at this review are not determinative of any assessment of the candidate's professional development at a later review. At all reviews, the Reappointments Committee or Promotions Committee makes an independent determination governed only by the standards for reappointment, promotion, and tenure as then published in the College's Rules of Appointment and Tenure, with which faculty members are expected to be familiar.\"</p>\n<p><em>(r)</em> In the case of unsuccessful review, to offer to meet with the candidate for the same purpose.</p>\n<p><em>iii. Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty (VPAA/DoF)</em></p>\n<p><em>(a)</em> To initiate the review, in a timely fashion, so that all necessary information and documentation may be obtained from the candidate and other sources.</p>\n<p><em>(b)</em> To solicit information, on behalf of the Reappointments Committee, from candidates under review; to gather information from other sources when so requested by the Reappointments Committee.</p>\n<p><em>(c)</em> To maintain the candidates' review files, including course response forms.</p>\n<p><em>(d)</em> To serve as recording secretary of the Reappointments Committee.</p>\n<p><em>(e)</em> To provide counsel to the Reappointments Committee during the course of its deliberations.</p>\n<p><em>(f)</em> To provide counsel to the provost when the Reappointments Committee's deliberations are completed.</p>\n<p><em>(g)</em> In the case that the Reappointments Committee does not recommend reappointment, to prepare a written summary explaining to the provost the committee’s reasons for doing so, and to include this document in the review file.</p>\n<p><em>iv. Dean for Faculty Development and Research (DFDR)</em></p>\n<p><em>(a)</em> In the case of a review of a department chair or program director, to assume the role of chair or director for that review.</p>\n<p><em>v. Department Chair</em></p>\n<p><em>(a)</em> To arrange with the candidate an appropriate schedule of classroom visits by the chair or chair's designate, and to ensure that the number of visits by other colleagues does not unnecessarily disrupt the candidate's courses.</p>\n<p><em>(b)</em> To provide the Reappointments Committee with lists of at least six current students and six recent graduates who have taken at least one course from the candidate.</p>\n<p><em>(c)</em> To review the candidate's course response forms, available online through the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty.</p>\n<p><em>(d)</em> To meet with the candidate to discuss the contents of the departmental evaluation.</p>\n<p><em>(e)</em> To submit a letter to the Reappointments Committee containing the departmental evaluation according to section 2.e. The focus of the departmental evaluation shall be upon teaching, scholarship, contribution to the departmental program, and promise as a teacher and scholar. This letter will be shared with the tenured members of the department and the candidate undergoing the review.</p>\n<p><em>(f)</em> To write a letter to the Reappointments Committee, giving a personal recommendation, as a tenured member of the department, regarding the candidate.</p>\n<p><em>vi. Tenured Department Faculty Members</em></p>\n<p><em>(a)</em> To submit a letter of recommendation, when requested, to the Reappointments Committee, with a copy to the department chair, that speaks to those aspects of a candidate's work with which he or she is familiar. Tenured faculty are expected to provide a letter upon request of the Committee, whether on academic leave or not.</p>\n<p><em>(b)</em> Upon the invitation of a candidate, to observe a class or classes and to meet with the candidate to discuss his or her performance in the class, with suggestions for possible improvement. Such meetings will be held before the end of the term during which the visits take place.</p>\n<p><em>vii. Program Director</em></p>\n<p><em>(a)</em> To submit a letter to the Reappointments Committee containing the programmatic evaluation according to section 2.f. The focus of the programmatic evaluation shall be upon teaching, scholarship, contribution to the program, and promise as a teacher and scholar. This letter will be shared with the tenured program members who have been solicited by the VPAA/DoF to write letters and the candidate undergoing the review.</p>\n<p><em>viii. Provost</em></p>\n<p><em>(a)</em> To review all items in the candidate's review file. (This includes letters related to the case received during the period of review from faculty, students, alumni, and others.

Contract Reviews</strong></p>\n<p>A contract review concentrates on promise and performance as a teacher and, in the case of Special Appointment faculty undergoing a review for promotion to Associate Professor (without tenure) or Associate Laboratory Professor, on service and scholarship and/or pedagogical innovation. Among the information considered by the Reappointments Committee, the departmental or programmatic evaluation will be accorded the greatest weight; however, the Reappointments Committee will also review course materials, and course response forms, and will consider the composition and long-term needs of the department or program and the faculty in arriving at its final recommendation. In the case of Special Appointment faculty undergoing a review for promotion to Associate Professor (without tenure) or Associate Laboratory Professor, the Reappointments Committee will also examine evidence for scholarship and/or pedagogical innovation. The review will follow the procedures in 3.f.i. through 3.f.vii. below.</p>\n<p>When a candidate on a term appointment may be renewed, and the Educational Affairs Committee has authorized a continuation of the position held, the candidates' performance in teaching, as the teaching responsibilities are defined by the position held, will be reviewed.

In that case, the Reappointments Committee will also consider service to the institution and scholarship and/or pedagogical innovation as a component of the review. Excellence in teaching will remain the sole criterion for reappointment, but candidates who have completed significant service to the institution, as defined in subsection 2.d. and who have established a clear record of significant scholarly activity and/or pedagogical innovation may be recommended for promotion to Associate Professor (without tenure) or Associate Laboratory Professor. In the event that the record of scholarly activity and/or pedagogical innovation is not deemed  adequate for promotion, but the record of teaching excellence is deemed appropriate for reappointment, the faculty member will be reappointed as Assistant Professor (non-tenure-track) or Assistant Laboratory Professor.</p>\n<p>A candidate on visiting appointment with a title normally associated with a regular appointment (e.g., Visiting Assistant Professor) may be renewed, but only up to a maximum of three years in that position. After that point, at the time of renewal the position will be converted to the appropriate level Special Appointment (e.g., Associate Professor, non-tenure-track).</p>\n<p><em><a name=\"contract_responsibilities\" id=\"contract_responsibilities\"></a>i.

Prior service counts for anyone who has held a regular, full-time appointment at a senior college or university. Only full-year appointments at Middlebury or elsewhere counts toward tenure date.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"reviews_term\" id=\"reviews_term\"></a>b. Review Schedule for Term Appointments</strong><br>\nInitial term appointments to the Middlebury College faculty may range from one to three years. Term appointments may be made at any rank, regardless of the normal phasing of reviews. Term appointments are intended to accommodate contextual needs in instructional programs or the needs of the faculty member appointed. Reappointment may be offered for periods less than the normal reappointment period when contextual needs in an instructional program require it.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"length_appt_tenure\" id=\"length_appt_tenure\"></a>c. Length of Appointment and Tenure</strong><br>\nA faculty member with a regular full-time appointment may not serve beyond the eighth year (at Middlebury or as accumulated) without review for tenure, except when the initial term appointment carries beyond the eighth year (as accumulated). With the exceptions noted below, faculty members holding special full-time appointments may not be reappointed beyond the eighth year of full-time teaching at Middlebury College. This limitation does not apply to faculty members in the following categories as defined previously in section 1.c.ii., Faculty Appointments, Special Appointments.</p>\n<p>i. <em>Lecturers and Senior Lecturers</em><br>\nii. <em>Assistant Professor (non-tenure-track) and Associate Professor (without tenure)</em><br>\niii. <em>Assistants in Instruction</em><br>\niv. <em>Laboratory Instructor, Assistant Laboratory Professor, and Associate Laboratory Professor</em><br>\nv. <em>Members of the Department of Physical Education</em><br>\nvi. <em>Administrative appointments with faculty rank</em></p>\n<p>When (following a stringent review by the Reappointments Committee) a full-time faculty member is appointed beyond the eighth year, the length of the employment contract will normally be from three to five years.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"early_review\" id=\"early_review\"></a>d. Early Reviews</strong><br>\nThe decision to be reviewed early for tenure rests with the individual faculty member. If a colleague requests an early tenure review, the Promotions Committee will review the faculty member according to the appropriate criteria for the tenure review as outlined. A faculty member electing early review waives the terms of the existing letter of appointment pertaining to length of appointment to the faculty. If the review results in a decision not to reappoint, no later review will be undertaken, and faculty members who have been denied tenure will be offered a one-year terminal appointment for the year succeeding the review. A request for an early tenure review that anticipates notification of the decision by December 15 should be received by the VPAA/DoF by May 15 prior; a request that anticipates notification by May 15 should be received by December 15 prior. Time spent on leave (except for sick or parental leave) does not alter the time of review; i.e., the timing of the review is calculated strictly from the date of first appointment, regardless of any time on leave for the purposes of scholarship and other professional development.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"deferred_reviews\" id=\"deferred_reviews\"></a>e. Deferred Reviews</strong><br>\nFaculty members may request a delay in the tenure review. The VPAA/DoF may grant a delay if the professional development of a member of the faculty has been impaired by a particularly demanding institutional role or by poor health, family obligations, or legally recognized disabilities. In no case, however, will a tenure review take place later than the tenth year of full-time teaching.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"notification_date\" id=\"notification_date\"></a>f. Notification Date</strong><br>\nPersons undergoing a first review will be notified of decisions no later than December 15 of their final year of appointment. Persons undergoing a tenure review will be notified of decisions no later than May 15 of the year preceding their final year of appointment. Faculty undergoing a review for promotion to full professor will be notified no later than February 15 of the review year. Faculty undergoing a ten-year review will be notified no later than June 1 of the review year. All other faculty being reviewed normally will be notified no later than February 15.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"retire\" id=\"retire\"></a>g. Retirement</strong><br>\nRetirement may be arranged at any time a faculty member chooses. Retirements will normally become effective on the terminal date of a fiscal year. Appointment of a retired faculty member to a period of active service at Middlebury College will be at the discretion of the president.</p>"},"8e5ede9e-52cc-5eb3-bfcf-762573b31c26":{"id":"8e5ede9e-52cc-5eb3-bfcf-762573b31c26","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/benefits/benefit-changes","title":"3.2 Benefit Changes","body":"\n### Health, Dental, Vision and Flexible Spending Accounts\n\nIn accordance with IRS regulations, changes such as adding or dropping coverage for an employee or dependent can only be made at certain times: 1) the initial eligibility period (the 30 days after an employee is first hired or the 30 days after an employee first moves into a benefits-eligible employment status), 2) the yearly open enrollment period, and 3) within 30 days of a _change in family status_ (as defined by the IRS).

Where other Middlebury policies specify separate processes, those processes will apply. See, e.g., the [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin); the [Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic and Dating Violence and Misconduct, and Stalking](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/smdvs); and the [Hazing Policy](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/hazing-policy). Moreover, where applicable laws where the program takes place mandate different procedures or policies, those procedures or policies will apply.\n\nSince Middlebury lacks full judicial authority, such as the power to subpoena or place witnesses under oath, a student's rights cannot be coextensive with or identical to the rights afforded someone accused in a civil or criminal legal proceeding. However, the procedures outlined below and in the [Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October), [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin) and [Hazing Policy](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/hazing-policy) are designed to provide fundamental fairness and to protect students from arbitrary or capricious disciplinary action. All judicial affairs officers, human relations officers, deans, directors, and other Middlebury disciplinary authorities shall conduct their proceedings in the spirit of these principles. If exceptional circumstances dictate variation from these procedures, the variation will not invalidate a decision unless it prevented fundamental fairness.\n\nStudents found to have violated Middlebury policy may be subject to the full range of disciplinary actions, as applicable, up to and including expulsion from any Language School program or other Middlebury program.\n\nAlleged policy violations should be reported to the dean of Language Schools. The dean or designee (hereinafter referred to as \"the dean\") is ordinarily responsible for disciplinary action. Except in cases of emergency suspension, withdrawal or expulsion as described above, the following disciplinary process will apply. In the event that a complaint or report of an alleged policy violation is made against a Language School student, the accused student will be given notice of the alleged violation and an opportunity to respond to the allegations prior to any determination or disciplinary action. The notice may be given orally or in writing. The \"opportunity to respond\" means that the student will be given an opportunity to meet and/or communicate with the dean.\n\nThe dean will then make a determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence, as to whether the student violated the policy at issue. Formal rules of evidence do not apply in Middlebury conduct proceedings. If a student is found responsible for a policy violation, the dean shall determine what disciplinary or other action should be taken, if any. If the dean determines that the circumstances do not warrant immediate expulsion from the program, the dean may take other action, including the issuance of warnings, reprimands, probationary status, official College discipline, or suspension from the program. The dean may also assign non-disciplinary action as appropriate, including the issuance of No Contact Orders, room changes, class changes, or other actions as needed. Disciplinary action may be accompanied by notification to the student's undergraduate or graduate institution (or any other program in which the student is involved) and to the parents of dependent students. For more information, see “Scope of Oversight” above.\n\nThe student may appeal the dean's decision to the provost within three (3) business days of issuance of the dean's determination.

Where other Middlebury policies specify separate processes, those processes will apply. See, e.g., the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin\">Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/smdvs\">Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic and Dating Violence and Misconduct, and Stalking</a>; and the <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/hazing-policy\">Hazing Policy</a>. Moreover, where applicable laws where the program takes place mandate different procedures or policies, those procedures or policies will apply.</p>\n<p>Since Middlebury lacks full judicial authority, such as the power to subpoena or place witnesses under oath, a student's rights cannot be coextensive with or identical to the rights afforded someone accused in a civil or criminal legal proceeding. However, the procedures outlined below and in the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October\">Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking</a>, <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin\">Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy</a> and <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/hazing-policy\">Hazing Policy</a> are designed to provide fundamental fairness and to protect students from arbitrary or capricious disciplinary action. All judicial affairs officers, human relations officers, deans, directors, and other Middlebury disciplinary authorities shall conduct their proceedings in the spirit of these principles. If exceptional circumstances dictate variation from these procedures, the variation will not invalidate a decision unless it prevented fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p>Students found to have violated Middlebury policy may be subject to the full range of disciplinary actions, as applicable, up to and including expulsion from any Language School program or other Middlebury program.</p>\n<p>Alleged policy violations should be reported to the dean of Language Schools. The dean or designee (hereinafter referred to as \"the dean\") is ordinarily responsible for disciplinary action. Except in cases of emergency suspension, withdrawal or expulsion as described above, the following disciplinary process will apply. In the event that a complaint or report of an alleged policy violation is made against a Language School student, the accused student will be given notice of the alleged violation and an opportunity to respond to the allegations prior to any determination or disciplinary action. The notice may be given orally or in writing. The \"opportunity to respond\" means that the student will be given an opportunity to meet and/or communicate with the dean.</p>\n<p>The dean will then make a determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence, as to whether the student violated the policy at issue. Formal rules of evidence do not apply in Middlebury conduct proceedings. If a student is found responsible for a policy violation, the dean shall determine what disciplinary or other action should be taken, if any. If the dean determines that the circumstances do not warrant immediate expulsion from the program, the dean may take other action, including the issuance of warnings, reprimands, probationary status, official College discipline, or suspension from the program. The dean may also assign non-disciplinary action as appropriate, including the issuance of No Contact Orders, room changes, class changes, or other actions as needed. Disciplinary action may be accompanied by notification to the student's undergraduate or graduate institution (or any other program in which the student is involved) and to the parents of dependent students. For more information, see “Scope of Oversight” above.</p>\n<p>The student may appeal the dean's decision to the provost within three (3) business days of issuance of the dean's determination. Appeals may be granted on the basis of one or more of the following grounds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discovery of significant new factual material not available to the dean of Language Schools that could have affected the original result; however, prior omission of factual information that the student knew or should reasonably have known about is not a ground for an appeal;</li>\n<li>Procedural error where the error prevented fundamental fairness;</li>\n<li>Extreme mitigating circumstances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The student must submit evidence and/or arguments they believe support any of the three grounds for appeal listed above, and their explanation of the evidence or arguments.  The provost may deny the appeal, or if one or more of the appeal grounds have been met, may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>return the case to the dean of Language Schools  for reconsideration; or</li>\n<li>appoint an alternate disciplinary authority, as appropriate, to review the case.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Absent extenuating circumstances, the provost will notify the student of the appeal decision within five business days of the appeal receipt deadline.

Voluntary Withdrawal**\n\nTo withdraw from the Language Schools a student must complete and sign an official Withdrawal Form at the Language Schools office. For more information, refer to the [Withdrawals and Refunds Policy](/pages/iii-policies-for-the-language-schools/c-financial-policies/c-3-withdrawals-and-refunds). Students who withdrawal are subject to the readmission requirements below.\n\n**B. Mandatory Withdrawal**\n\ni. The Language Schools provides a range of support services to address the medical needs of students, including mental health needs, within the context of the campus community. On occasion, students may experience health needs requiring a level of care that exceeds what Middlebury can appropriately provide. In such circumstances, students may withdraw from their Language School program (see “Voluntary Withdraw,” above). In situations where a student is unable or unwilling to carry out substantial self-care obligations, where their behavior is unduly disruptive to the community, where current medical knowledge and/or the best available objective evidence indicates that a student poses a significant risk to the health or safety of others, or where a student poses an actual risk to their own safety not based on mere speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals with disabilities, and the student does not want to withdraw voluntarily, the dean of the Language Schools or designee (hereinafter referred to as the “dean”) has the authority to withdraw the student.\n\nii. Before placing any student on a mandatory withdraw, Middlebury will do an individualized assessment to determine if there are reasonable accommodations that would permit the student to continue to participate in the campus community without withdrawing from the program.  A medical evaluation by a competent specialist may be required. To enable careful, individualized consideration, the student may need to sign a release authorizing disclosure of relevant information by and between treatment providers working with the student and the appropriate Middlebury official(s).\n\niii. The student will be notified of the withdrawal decision in writing. Student(s) will be given notice and an opportunity to speak with the dean prior to or within five business days following the start of the mandatory withdrawal. The decision may be appealed, following the procedures set forth in Section iv., below.\n\niv. An appeal of a mandatory withdrawal decision may be made in writing (including email) to the provost or designee (hereinafter referred to as the “provost”) within five business days of receipt of the decision. The appeal must state the grounds for the appeal and include any supporting evidence. Absent extenuating circumstances, the provost will ordinarily notify the student of the appeal decision within five business days of receipt of the appeal.\n\nv. Students withdrawn under this section may also be subject to the normal disciplinary processes if their conduct has violated any Middlebury policy. If disciplinary action is appropriate, the matter must be resolved either before or immediately upon the student’s return.\n\n**C. Readmission**\n\ni. A student who seeks readmission to the Language Schools after withdrawal should contact the dean of the Language Schools. Students eligible for readmission can expect to receive instructions for completing applicable readmission forms from the appropriate Language School official. They must confirm their plan to return to their Language School program by the deadline set by the official. Students may be subject to certain readmission requirements. See below.\n\nii. Students who are withdrawn from their Language School program are eligible for readmission to the Middlebury undergraduate program (as applicable to current Middlebury undergraduate students) for a three-year period. Students seeking readmission to any other Middlebury program should consult with that program’s director, dean or other responsible Middlebury official regarding the eligibility period.\n\niii. Many students who withdraw will have no requirements attached to their readmission to the Language Schools or any other Middlebury program. In some cases, a dean, program director, the VPSA, Provost, or other appropriate Middlebury official or designee may impose specific requirements for readmission to the Language Schools, the Middlebury undergraduate program, or any other Middlebury program, as applicable, if the circumstances of the student’s departure warrant it. The goal of such conditions is to prepare the student for a successful return to Middlebury; for example, a student may be asked to complete pre-approved coursework at another institution in order to demonstrate readiness to return to rigorous academic work or to provide clinical information to staff of the Parton Center for Health & Wellness to facilitate a successful return. For example, a student may need to complete the Medical Return Form and respond to any follow-up requests for information from Parton staff. If the withdrawal is health-related, any conditions or requirements for reinstatement will be based on an individualized assessment of each student including consideration of current medical knowledge and/or the best available objective evidence. Careful consideration will be given to the opinions and recommendations of the student’s treating physician or mental health professional, if available.\n\niv. As appropriate to the individual circumstances of a student’s departure, a dean, program director, VPSA or other Middlebury official or appropriate designee may also require that the student provide information to their program director, commons dean, or other appropriate Middlebury official when they seek readmission. Typically, this includes a letter about the student's understanding of the problem that led to the withdrawal, evidence of the student’s work to resolve the issue and/or progress made in managing the issue and other information that may assist Middlebury in evaluating whether the student can safely and effectively participate in the Language School’s academic programs, the undergraduate college or any other Middlebury program to which the student seeks readmission, as applicable.\n\nv. Students eligible for readmission to a Middlebury program other than the Language Schools (e.g., the undergraduate college) should notify their Commons dean, program director or other appropriate program official, as applicable, to obtain instructions for completing applicable readmission forms. They must confirm their plan to return with their Commons dean, program director or appropriate program official by the deadlines set by the official. For the undergraduate college please note the deadlines and requirements set forth in the [Student Status](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/student-status) policy. Undergraduate students who fail to confirm their plans to return by these deadlines will be placed on a waiting list for readmission. Normally, readmission to the undergraduate college is for fall or spring semester only. Students will be readmitted for winter term or summer study only with special permission from the Vice President for Student Affairs.\n\nvi. Students on probation for disciplinary or academic reasons will resume their probationary status upon their return for the duration of the assigned probationary period.\n\nvii. In the rare circumstance that a student’s request for readmission is denied on grounds of health or safety, the decision may be appealed in writing to the Vice President for Student Affairs or designee (undergraduate program), or as appropriate, to the Provost or designee (all other Middlebury programs). The appeal must state the grounds for the appeal and include any supporting evidence. Absent extenuating circumstances, the appellate official will ordinarily notify the student of the appeal decision within five business days of receipt of the appeal.\n\n**D.

All other Language Schools and programs hold course registration on site after arrival. Once students have selected courses with their advisors, registration information is sent directly to the Registrar’s Office. Students’ courses will be listed on BannerWeb on the first day of class. If an error in scheduling occurs, students need to check with the Assistant Director of their Language School.\n\n**ADD/DROP Procedures**\n\nAdd/Drop cards are available in each School office. Students must obtain the signatures of the instructors involved in the added and dropped courses, as well as signature of the director or associate director of the School. Students cannot add new courses after the Add/Drop deadline. Courses dropped before the Add/Drop deadline do not appear on transcripts. Courses dropped after the posted deadlines, but on or before July 23 will receive a grade of WD on the transcript. Courses dropped after July 23 receive a grade of WDF on the transcript. Notifying an instructor of non-attendance does not constitute official withdrawal from a course.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Add/Drop Deadlines:</span>\n\nArabic, Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish 6-week sessions: July 2\n\nFrench, German, Hebrew, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish 7-week sessions: July 5\n\nArabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Russian 8-week sessions: July 6\n\nAll 3 and 4-week sessions: end of the third day of class\n\n\\*_ Last date to drop without grade penalty for all programs is July 23 _\n\n**Credits and Credit Load**\n\nAll credit awarded by the Language Schools is defined in terms of units. One unit equals three semester hours of credit. Students enrolled in the eight-week session of the Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Russian Schools normally earn four units of credit. Students enrolled in the seven-week session of the French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish Schools normally earn three units of credit. Students enrolled in the six-week graduate programs of the Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Russian, and Spanish Schools normally earn three units of credit. Graduate students are not permitted to repeat a course for which they have received a passing grade and earned credit. For all other students, repeating a course is allowed only with permission of the director of the school. This permission only will be granted in exceptional cases. To request permission to repeat a course, non-graduate students must submit a request in writing. The request must include justification as to why permission to repeat courses should be considered. If approval to repeat a course (or courses) is granted, only the first grade is calculated into the grade point average, and the course is only counted once for credit, although both grades appear on the transcript.\n\nFor transfer purposes, the student’s home institution determines how many credits, graduate or undergraduate, are granted. Students should consult their home campus advisors.\n\nAll students must pay the full tuition even if they carry less than the full load of courses.\n\nA degree must be earned within a 10-year period. All units of credit expire after 10 years, whether earned at Middlebury College or transferred from another institution. Thus, credit earned at the 2020 session will expire after the end of the 2030 session.

For all other students, repeating a course is allowed only with permission of the director of the school. This permission only will be granted in exceptional cases. To request permission to repeat a course, non-graduate students must submit a request in writing. The request must include justification as to why permission to repeat courses should be considered. If approval to repeat a course (or courses) is granted, only the first grade is calculated into the grade point average, and the course is only counted once for credit, although both grades appear on the transcript.</p>\n<p>For transfer purposes, the student’s home institution determines how many credits, graduate or undergraduate, are granted.

Written requests will be reviewed by the director whose decision, in consultation with faculty and the vice president’s office (if necessary), is final. Any student who is granted permission for readmission to the summer of candidacy must successfully complete all courses required for the degree.\n\nA highly-qualified undergraduate student may accumulate, before receipt of the Bachelor of Arts degree or equivalent, a maximum of three graduate units at the Language Schools to be applied toward the Middlebury Master of Arts degree.

Transfer courses may not be used to make up failures (see *Transfer Credits* section below). All failed courses must be made up in a summer session at Middlebury or Bennington. A Master of Arts candidate who withdraws from a School Abroad may complete the degree only through further study during a summer session at Middlebury or Bennington.

Students need to submit in writing which option they intend to follow.\n\nOnly courses taken after successful completion of the initial summer and formal admission to degree candidacy can be transferred. Courses taken at other institutions before the first summer of study may not be transferred toward a Middlebury degree, and transferred courses may not be used toward any other degree. Written approval of a course’s transferability must be obtained from Middlebury before registering for the course. Courses that have not been pre-approved will be considered for transfer only in those instances in which a student can demonstrate that pre-approval was not possible (for example, due to a last minute cancellation of a pre-approved course). Middlebury courses transferred from one degree program are not eligible for another Middlebury degree.\n\nCourses for transfer must be graduate level and taken at an accredited institution that offers a Master of Arts degree in either the language of study or a related discipline.

In addition, supply your Assistant Director with a photograph and brief biography (200–250 words) to be posted on the Language Schools' website.

It is expected that students miss class only for illness or the most compelling of reasons. Normally students are not permitted to miss more than three days of class. Missing more than three days will likely result in removal from the program and failing grades. Please report to the director of your School any student who is frequently absent from class.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Advising Students</span>\n\nPlease refer students who seem to be experiencing difficulty(handling stress, adjusting to language immersion, etc.) to either the College counseling center in Centeno House, ext. 5141, or the dean on call. Please reassure students that the Language Pledge is suspended when dealing with all health and counseling personnel.\n\nWe urge you to refer students who seem to be experiencing trouble adjusting to the College counseling center in Centeno House, ext. 5141, or to the Dean, Stephen Snyder, ext. 5292\\. Please reassure students that the Language Pledge is suspended when dealing with all health and counseling personnel.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Student Records</span>\n\nIn accordance with [FERPA](/pages/i-policies-for-all/records/ferpa) (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974), students or former students of Middlebury College have the right to inspect all educational records placed in their files after January 1975\\. Note: For additional information, contact the Registrar's Office at ext. 5770.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Class Lists</span>\n\nPlease check class lists carefully for accuracy, and report any discrepancies to your School coordinator. If there are students in your class whose names do not appear on your class list, request that they clarify their status immediately with the School office. Note: Auditors are not included on class lists, and may not take an active part in class.\n\nClass lists will be distributed at the beginning of the session. Please keep your list up-to-date during the add/drop period. Changes made through the add/drop period should be corrected by hand until you receive updated lists.\n\nOnce you receive the revised lists, please check to ensure that adds and drops have been properly entered. It is important that this be done carefully, as these lists are used for both final grades and for billing when extra courses are taken.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Course Changes</span>\n\nStudents who wish to add or drop a course, or change from one section to another, must present you with add/drop cards for your signature and approval. The director or associate director of your School must also sign the cards. Please note the add/drop deadlines for [Middlebury campus programs](/pages/iii-policies-for-the-language-schools/b-academic-policies/b-4-registration) and [Bennington campus programs](/pages/iii-policies-for-the-language-schools/b-academic-policies/b-4-registration).\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Plagiarism</span>\n\nPlease review Middlebury College's policies on [Academic Honesty](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/acad-honesty), as U.S. institutions are very strict about these matters. In particular, please emphasize to your students how sources are to be cited, and what, if any, consultation about work may take place among students.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Grades and Evaluations</span>\n\nPlease conform carefully to the [grading system](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/grades-transcripts) used at Middlebury College. If this system differs from that of your home institution, or if you are unfamiliar with U.S. grading practices, please discuss the matter with the director of your School.\n\nChanges in grades are permitted only to correct clerical errors or to ensure fairness to a student. If you find it necessary to change a grade, you must obtain a grade change form from your School office and submit the completed form to the director of your School.\n\nFaculty members will be asked to evaluate graduate students who hope to be admitted to one of the Language Schools abroad. We appreciate your taking the time to make a careful and specific evaluation.\n\n**NOTE:** The A+ grade is available only at the graduate level and represents an extraordinary level of achievement. Please meet with your director to complete a special form before assigning this grade. Also, please be aware that a failure report form must be completed and returned with your grade roster if you assign a student a failing grade.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Use of Electronic Resources at the Language Schools</span>\n\nAll work submitted by students must be their own. It is unacceptable for students to have a native speaker of the language write their work. It is unacceptable to copy language from any source without quotation marks and proper reference. Use of any translation program to create work that is then turned in as the student's own, unless the assignment explicitly calls for the use of such programs, is considered plagiarism, serious offense and can result in punishment up to and including expulsion from the Language Schools.\n\nThe use of online dictionaries is acceptable because students are responsible for using the provided words or short phrases, choosing the most appropriate one, putting it in the proper grammatical context, and providing all necessary punctuation. A translation program, on the other hand, provides a complete phrase or longer piece of text; here a student has only to copy the provided words. Therefore, anything created by a translation program cannot be considered the student's own work and, such work will be considered academic misconduct, which is a serious offense and can result in punishment up to and including expulsion from the Language Schools.\n\nMiddlebury Language Schools students are bound by the Middlebury [Honor Code](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/acad-honesty).   \n<span></span>\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Grade Rosters</span>\n\nYour director or associate director will notify you when the online grading window is open. Please make sure you complete and submit all grade rosters in BannerWeb before leaving campus. Do not issue the final grades to your individual students. All grades are reported to students through BannerWeb.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Survey Policy</span>\n\nAll surveys or questionnaires, of any kind, involving faculty, students, or staff, must be registered in advance with the office of the Dean of the Language Schools. The Dean's office will contact the director of the School (or Schools) involved for their permission. No surveys may be conducted without permission from both the dean and director(s) of the School(s). Each proposed survey needs to state in clear and unequivocal terms that participation by faculty or students is entirely voluntary and in no way related to course requirements or grades. If students are involved, the survey also must be approved by [Middlebury's Institutional Review Board (IRB)](https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/resources/irb).\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Copyright and Fair Use Guidelines</span>\n\nU.S. law provides protection to authors, creators, and publishers of works of literature or art. The law also enumerates specific uses that do not infringe on copyright for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research (e.g. fair use). Middlebury College values and respects intellectual property rights, even as it recognizes an equal responsibility to advance the needs of scholarship and teaching within the framework of the law.  \nPlease review the [Intellectual Property Policy.](/pages/i-policies-for-all/appropriate-use/intell-property)\n","excerpt":"Your Employment Middlebury Language Schools' faculty and staff are considered \"at will\" employees.

Please note the add/drop deadlines for <a href=\"/pages/iii-policies-for-the-language-schools/b-academic-policies/b-4-registration\">Middlebury campus programs</a> and <a href=\"/pages/iii-policies-for-the-language-schools/b-academic-policies/b-4-registration\">Bennington campus programs</a>.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Plagiarism</span></p>\n<p>Please review Middlebury College's policies on <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/acad-honesty\">Academic Honesty</a>, as U.S. institutions are very strict about these matters. In particular, please emphasize to your students how sources are to be cited, and what, if any, consultation about work may take place among students.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Grades and Evaluations</span></p>\n<p>Please conform carefully to the <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/grades-transcripts\">grading system</a> used at Middlebury College. If this system differs from that of your home institution, or if you are unfamiliar with U.S. grading practices, please discuss the matter with the director of your School.</p>\n<p>Changes in grades are permitted only to correct clerical errors or to ensure fairness to a student. If you find it necessary to change a grade, you must obtain a grade change form from your School office and submit the completed form to the director of your School.</p>\n<p>Faculty members will be asked to evaluate graduate students who hope to be admitted to one of the Language Schools abroad. We appreciate your taking the time to make a careful and specific evaluation.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The A+ grade is available only at the graduate level and represents an extraordinary level of achievement. Please meet with your director to complete a special form before assigning this grade. Also, please be aware that a failure report form must be completed and returned with your grade roster if you assign a student a failing grade.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Use of Electronic Resources at the Language Schools</span></p>\n<p>All work submitted by students must be their own. It is unacceptable for students to have a native speaker of the language write their work. It is unacceptable to copy language from any source without quotation marks and proper reference. Use of any translation program to create work that is then turned in as the student's own, unless the assignment explicitly calls for the use of such programs, is considered plagiarism, serious offense and can result in punishment up to and including expulsion from the Language Schools.</p>\n<p>The use of online dictionaries is acceptable because students are responsible for using the provided words or short phrases, choosing the most appropriate one, putting it in the proper grammatical context, and providing all necessary punctuation. A translation program, on the other hand, provides a complete phrase or longer piece of text; here a student has only to copy the provided words. Therefore, anything created by a translation program cannot be considered the student's own work and, such work will be considered academic misconduct, which is a serious offense and can result in punishment up to and including expulsion from the Language Schools.</p>\n<p>Middlebury Language Schools students are bound by the Middlebury <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/acad-honesty\">Honor Code</a>. <br>\n<span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Grade Rosters</span></p>\n<p>Your director or associate director will notify you when the online grading window is open. Please make sure you complete and submit all grade rosters in BannerWeb before leaving campus. Do not issue the final grades to your individual students. All grades are reported to students through BannerWeb.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Survey Policy</span></p>\n<p>All surveys or questionnaires, of any kind, involving faculty, students, or staff, must be registered in advance with the office of the Dean of the Language Schools. The Dean's office will contact the director of the School (or Schools) involved for their permission. No surveys may be conducted without permission from both the dean and director(s) of the School(s). Each proposed survey needs to state in clear and unequivocal terms that participation by faculty or students is entirely voluntary and in no way related to course requirements or grades. If students are involved, the survey also must be approved by <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/resources/irb\">Middlebury's Institutional Review Board (IRB)</a>.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Copyright and Fair Use Guidelines</span></p>\n<p>U.S. law provides protection to authors, creators, and publishers of works of literature or art. The law also enumerates specific uses that do not infringe on copyright for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research (e.g. fair use). Middlebury College values and respects intellectual property rights, even as it recognizes an equal responsibility to advance the needs of scholarship and teaching within the framework of the law.<br>\nPlease review the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/appropriate-use/intell-property\">Intellectual Property Policy.</a></p>"},"629de06b-05bd-5e13-a5b3-e55e3bc3a0ec":{"id":"629de06b-05bd-5e13-a5b3-e55e3bc3a0ec","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute","title":"IV.

Academic Honesty","body":"\nThe Institute requires of every student, complete intellectual honesty in the preparation of all assigned academic work.\n\n### A. Definitions\n\n**Plagiarism**\n\nPlagiarism is a violation of intellectual honesty. Plagiarism is passing off another person's work as one's own. It is taking and presenting as one's own the ideas, research, writings, creations, or inventions of another. It makes no difference whether the source is a student or a professional in some field. For example, in written work, whenever as much as a sentence or key phrase is taken from the work of another without specific citation of the source, the issue of plagiarism arises.\n\nParaphrasing is the close restatement of another's idea using approximately the language of the original. Paraphrasing without acknowledgment of authorship is also plagiarism and is as serious a violation as an unacknowledged quotation.\n\nIntentional or unintentional failure to attribute facts that are not common knowledge (whether represented in textual, graphic, statistical, or visual form) also constitutes plagiarism. All writing submitted for formal and informal assessment must be the student’s own work.\n\n**Cheating**\n\nThe term “cheating” includes providing, soliciting, or receiving assistance before or during an examination or quiz that is not explicitly authorized by the instructor of record. Copying from a fellow student’s examination or quiz paper, possessing or using unauthorized material during an examinations or quiz (e.g., notes, books, electronic devices) and continuing to write after an exercise has ended all constitute cheating. Inadmissible forms of assistance include allowing a fellow student to copy from an examination or quiz paper, sharing unauthorized materials (e.g. notes, books, electronic devices), and talking or whispering during an examination or quiz. Similarly egregious violations of these standards include, but are not limited to: taking an examination or quiz paper from the room and later claiming that the instructor lost it; changing answers after the examination or quiz has been returned; fraudulent possession of an examination or quiz prior to administration; obtaining a copy of an examination, quiz, or solution key prior to administration; taking an examination or quiz for another student; and persuading another person to take an examination or quiz for oneself.\n\n**Duplicate Use of Written Work**\n\nA paper submitted to meet the requirements of a particular course is assumed to be work completed for that course; the same paper, or substantially similar papers, may not be used to meet the requirements of two different courses, in the same or different terms, without the prior consent of each faculty member involved. Students incorporating similar material in more than one paper are required to confirm each professor's expectations in advance.\n\n**Misconduct in Research**\n\nIf there is student research misconduct in the form of fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism, in research sponsored by the federal government, additional procedures and reporting will apply as directed by the Middlebury Misconduct in Research and Other Scholarly Activities Policies and Procedures. Students also have an obligation to report observed, suspected, or apparent research misconduct and to cooperate in the review of inquiries and allegations.\n\n### B. Student Responsibilities\n\nGraded assignments should be the work of the individual student, unless otherwise directed by the professor. Students must assume responsibility for their own integrity on all assigned academic work.\n\nThe individual student is responsible for ensuring that his or her work does not involve plagiarism. Ignorance of the nature of plagiarism or of The Institute’s policies may not be offered as a mitigating circumstance.\n\nStudents with uncertainties and questions on matters relating to footnoting, citation of sources, paraphrasing lecture notes, and proper recognition of collaborative work on homework assignments and reports should consult with the course professor for whom they are preparing work.\n\n### C. Role of the Faculty\n\nAt the beginning of each term, professors are strongly encouraged to discuss or include on their syllabus the Institute’s policies governing academic honesty as they relate to a particular course.\n\n### D. Violations of the Academic Honesty Policy, Procedures, and Disciplinary Actions\n\n- Any member of the Institute community (student, faculty, or administrator) who is aware of a case of academic dishonesty is morally obligated to report it to the professor, the dean of the relevant school or the associate dean of student services (ADSS).\n\n- Those who cheat are morally obliged to report their own offense to the professor, the dean of the relevant school or the ADSS.\n\n- Alleged violations will be handled according to the academic disciplinary policies. For cases that are heard by the Conduct Judicial Board, hearings may not be conducted with fewer than three members. Three votes are needed for a finding of responsibility for a policy violation. In the event of a finding of responsibility for a policy violation, sanctions shall be determined by majority vote.\n\n- Academic dishonesty is normally punishable by suspension from the Institute. However, the penalty may be modified when, in the opinion of the dean of the relevant program and the Conduct Judicial Board, conclusive reasons warrant such action.\n\n- Should the accused be found not guilty, all records of the proceeding will be destroyed.\n\n- Right of Appeal: A student found guilty of an offense will have the right of appeal to the Judicial Appeals Board in all cases.\n\n- All deliberations of the Conduct Judicial Board concerning academic dishonesty violations will be conducted in confidence.\n","excerpt":"The Institute requires of every student, complete intellectual honesty in the preparation of all assigned academic work.

Administrative Roles","body":"\nAs a graduate school of Middlebury, the administration of the Institute operates within the larger Middlebury administrative structure.  The academic administration of the Institute resides within the purview of the provost, who is the chief academic officer of Middlebury.  The provost is charged with providing strategic and operational leadership and with ensuring the quality and integrity of all its academic programs and initiatives, including those of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. In that capacity, the provost is involved in decision-making broadly across academic, financial, and operational spheres for the Institute.\n\nThis section describes the major administrative roles at the Institute and outlines the relationship and responsibilities of the Faculty with respect to each. Faculty members should be consulted in the selection of the vice president for academic affairs and dean of the Institute.\n\n**C.2.a. Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Institute (VPAA)**\n\n<abbr title=\"INSTITUTE COUNCIL The VPAA, along with the two school deans, and other administrators the VPAA may select, constitute the Institute Council. While an administrative body, the Council should consider input generated or collected by the Faculty Senate on Council decisions related to the academic program of MIIS, and decisions on faculty appointment evaluation.  INSTITUTE LEADERSHIP GROUP The Institute Leadership Group, convened by the VPAA, is a consultative body for decisions which affect the operations of the Institute. Faculty are represented on the ILG via the Faculty Senate President and/or the Faculty Senate Vice-President, as they so arrange, via the Faculty representative to the Institute Board of Overseers, and via the chair of the Academic Policies, Standards, and Instruction Committee.\">The VPAA is responsible for the overall management of the business and academic affairs of the Institute, including support in instruction, research, and development. In the exercise of the duties of the office, the VPAA meets with Faculty Senate when requested, and meets regularly with the Senate president and vice president, as well as consulting with other faculty representatives through the Institute Leadership Group, appropriate faculty committees, and the relevant deans.</abbr>\n\nThe VPAA is appointed by the president of Middlebury, and reports to the Middlebury provost. The VPAA is the Senior Administrative Officer serving as liaison to the Institute Board of Overseers.\n\nDue process should be followed in the selection of the VPAA. When a new Vice President of Academic Affairs/Dean of the Institute is select, Institute Faculty have the right to be meaningfully consulted in the selection. Feedback regarding the priorities for hiring and on the actual candidates should be gathered from the Faculty Assembly through a process designed and administered by the Faculty Senate, in conjunction with the current MIIS Council.\n\nAs part of the process by which the VPAA is evaluated, the faculty should be consulted for input in the annual review of the VPAA.\n\nThe VPAA directs the activities of other members of the staff, sees that the decisions and directives of the Institute Board of Advisors and the Middlebury Board of Trustees are implemented, and performs such other functions as the president and provost of Middlebury and the Institute Board of Advisors may require.\n\nThe VPAA appoints senior administrators; deans, associate deans, program chairs, and other academic administrators; as well as regular faculty members.\n\nThe VPAA appoints faculty members in accordance with processes described below. Faculty appointments are subject to the approval of the Middlebury Board of Trustees through its consent agenda.\n\nThe VPAA, along with the Middlebury provost, oversees the Institute’s response to charges of faculty misconduct, including procedures for  termination of  the appointment of a faculty member, in accordance with the policies of the Faculty Handbook.\n\nAcademic staff members are “at will” employees whose positions may be terminated at any time. (See Employee Handbook.)\n\n**C.2.b. Deans**\n\nA dean provides academic leadership and administrative management for a school of the Institutel. Deans articulate the interests of their schools, as well as coordinate with other Middlebury administrators on policies and decisions requiring collaboration. Deans ensure the effective formulation and implementation of academic policies, curriculum planning and development, budgeting, faculty recruitment and evaluation, and faculty development.\n\nDeans also work with the offices of Institutional Advancement and Alumni Relations; Marketing and Recruitment; Admissions, and Financial Aid; the Registrar’s Office; the Business Office; the Communications office, and other academic and administrative services, and with the Institute Board of Overseers when necessary or requested.\n\nDeans serve as liaisons with professional associations, as well as with academic, business, and professional communities, helping to increase the visibility of their schools and the Institute as a whole.\n\nSchool deans (GSTILE, GSIPM) may have two appointments. First, they may have a regular faculty appointment, the specific term of which is held in abeyance (does not run) while they serve as dean. Second, as administrators, deans report to the VPAA. Their appointment is normally for a scheduled term of three (3) years and is renewable. However, the VPAA has the authority to terminate these administrative appointments at any time prior to the three-year term. On termination of the administrative appointment, the faculty contract, if one is held, resumes and the dean has the option to resume regular faculty status under the faculty contract, unless the VPAA terminates the appointment of a faculty member in accordance with the process defined in this Faculty Handbook based upon conduct in their role as dean.\n\nThe relationships between the deans and Institute faculty is an important link between administrators and faculty at the Institute. It is at the school level that most academic matters arise and that the most important step in faculty evaluation takes place. A basic principle in the governance of the Institute is that deans consult their faculty on a regular basis. It is at the school level that faculty have the most authority and responsibility, and that mutual respect and consultation are most critical. One factor in establishing and maintaining this relationship is the active participation of faculty in the selection and evaluation of deans.\n\nWhen the position of a school dean becomes open, a search committee shall be formed, composed of the VPAA, three regular faculty members of that school selected by the school faculty, and one regular faculty member of the other school selected by that other school’s faculty. The search committee shall also actively seek input from students and relevant staff and be trained on diversity.This committee shall normally normally conduct an international search.\n\nThe committee shall approve the interviewing of at least three (3) finalists recommended by the committee. These candidates shall be interviewed by the search committee, the regular faculty of the school, the other deans, staff representatives, and student representatives.\n\nThe search committee shall gather and summarize comments on each candidate and create a ranked list of finalists from whom the VPAA makes the final selection.\n\nEvaluation of the deans is conducted by the VPAA according to guidelines in the Employee Handbook. The VPAA shall establish a process to solicit input from the faculty of the respective schools. This process of gathering input shall be completed by March 20th, so that faculty input can be taken into account in the VPAA's evaluation.\n\n**C.2.c. Program Chairs**\n\nProgram chairs are uniquely situated at the intersection of faculty and governance and administration. It is important that individuals in these roles are able to work well with both the faculty in their programs and with the deans who oversee their programs. Therefore, it is essential that the appointment of program chairs be a <abbr title=\" (a) The Dean of each Graduate School develops a formal process for gathering nominations from the full-time and visiting faculty members of the program to be chaired.

(c) The aim would be to achieve consensus among faculty members in a program (d) Final decisions will be made by the VPAA taking into consideration both the discussions with Deans and the program faculty (or relevant others that that program chair would interface with) and the voting results.   Program chairs should serve a maximum two three-year terms, in order to share the load and to give multiple faculty a chance to lead. Current program chairs who have been serving more than six years would be grandfathered in, but encouraged to plan for a transition to another colleague.\">_collaborative and consultative process_</abbr>. Program Chairs are appointed by the VPAA and report to the Dean of their graduate school with an initial appointment of one three-year term, with the possibility of a single second term extension. A third term should only be granted if that faculty member is the only willing candidate and there is consensus among program faculty. In order for their appointment to be extended for each additional term, the Dean must confidentially consult all faculty in the program. The VPAA in conjunction with the deans shall retain the discretion for early termination of the appointment of the chair of the program.\n\nThe dean is responsible for evaluating the program chair on an annual basis, although the Faculty Senate shall establish the procedures used to formatively evaluate program chairs, based on the description of duties developed by each program. Evaluations emanating from this process shall be forwarded to the dean, with the program chair being given an opportunity to respond. This process of gathering input shall be completed by April 30\\. The Senate maintains the formative evaluation form, and if changes are felt necessary by the dean or the faculty, the Senate will make such changes based on faculty input. The deans distribute the formative evaluation, receive the results, and review the results with the program chair.\n\n**C.2.d. Language-program-specific administrators**\n\nDeans may appoint, in coordination with program faculty and especially program chairs, language-program-specific administrators within more complex programs.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">1\\. Role of Language Program Director in T&I\n\nIn Translation and Interpretation, the Language Program Director (LPD) is responsible for staffing his/her program with qualified professors. The (LPD), in coordination with the T&I Program Chair and the Dean, will select candidates for an open position, interview the candidates and then make a recommendation to the Dean. The (LPD) is also responsible for the schedule each semester and coordinates with the (LPD)s in the other language programs. The (LPD) is also the mediator between students and a faculty member and only escalates an issue to the T&I Program Chair and/or Dean if it cannot be solved by the (LPD). The (LPD) keeps records of interim evaluations for every student. The (LPD) is responsible to have LSTs graded and will then contact the applicant after an applicant passes this early diagnostic test. The (LPD) stays in contact with the applicant and is available for any questions pertaining to the course of study. The (LPD) serves as academic advisor for all students in the Translation, Translation & Interpretation, and Conference Interpretation programs in their language.  The (LPD) meets once a month with the (LPD)s of the other language programs to coordinate any efforts.  The (LPD) also plays a very important role in recruiting students for the program.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">2\\. Role of Language Studies Language Coordinator\n\nThe Language Studies Coordinator plays a key role in supporting students’ learning and providing the necessary support to the language instructors. Each language studies program has its own coordinator whose job is to arrange the schedule for each semester and supervise the placement test for incoming students. The Coordinator’s responsibilities also include the organization of the co-curricular activities and the academic advising for students who plan to study abroad or attend immersive language programs. The Coordinator provides regular program updates to colleagues and meets with them once a month to discuss various pedagogical issues and ways to improve the curriculum and assessment within the language program. In addition, the Coordinator works as the liaison between the specific language unit and the other language programs within the LS Department. Each Coordinator reports directly to the Dean and attends the Coordinators’ monthly meeting as well as the LS meeting led by the Language Studies Program Chair and Dean. Besides these tasks, the LS Coordinators respond to inquiries about the specific language they represent and provide information about the academic component of the program. LS Coordinators also play a key role in recruiting students for the Institute, much of which is done via language departments at various partner schools.  LS Coordinators also supervise the Teaching Assistants and provide the necessary training for them.\n","excerpt":"As a graduate school of Middlebury, the administration of the Institute operates within the larger Middlebury administrative structure.  The…","html":"<p>As a graduate school of Middlebury, the administration of the Institute operates within the larger Middlebury administrative structure.  The academic administration of the Institute resides within the purview of the provost, who is the chief academic officer of Middlebury.  The provost is charged with providing strategic and operational leadership and with ensuring the quality and integrity of all its academic programs and initiatives, including those of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.

Early in the spring semester, APSIC reviews Part I of the _PSM_ in light of its deliberations over the preceding year, recommending changes and amendments to the Faculty Senate and VPAA for action and approval. Those changes and amendments that are approved by the administration are then included in the new edition of the _PSM_, prepared during the summer for distribution to students at the beginning of the fall semester.\n\nIn addition, APSIC:\n\n- evaluates and provides recommendations concerning proposed changes to the curriculum;\n- ensures compliance with academic policies and procedures;\n- deliberates on student grievances and appeals;\n- has at least two members serve on any Student Conduct Board dealing with an alleged student violation of academic standards or policies.\n\nAPSIC reports its recommendations to the VPAAand the Senate for action and approval. In the case of curricular and programmatic proposals requiring further deliberation, APSIC consults further with the proposers before forwarding revised recommendations to the VPAA and Senate.\n\n**C.4.i. Salary and Benefits Committee (_ad hoc_)**\n\nWhen constituted by the Faculty Senate, the primary role of this committee is to review and examine the structure of faculty benefits and salaries and make recommendations to the VPAA. The Committee shall work closely with the Human Resources staff at MIIS, and the benefits and compensation manager in the Human Resources department at Middlebury in the discharge of its responsibilities. Specific tasks and responsibilities are assigned at the time of constitution.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"></span>\n\n---\n\n\\* Faculty members should not serve on the FEC while their own contract renewal, promotion, or sabbatical is being evaluated by the FEC.

Visiting professors are normally appointed for one- to three-year terms, after which they may be considered, through the regular recruitment and appointment process, for a regular faculty position. Continuing appointments of Visiting professors are strongly discouraged. Visiting faculty are not eligible to apply for sabbatical or faculty development grants, and are not required to contribute service to the Institute.\n\nii. **Adjunct professors** are appointed on an _ad hoc_ basis to teach specific course(s) for which they have special expertise. For appointment as an Adjunct professor, a candidate normally must have earned a doctorate, or the highest degree available in the candidate’s field of specialization, or have exceptional experience, in a professional field that fits the mission of the Institute. Adjunct professors are recruited and appointed on a semester-to-semester basis by the administration (or relevant dean) in consultation with the Faculty. They must demonstrate outstanding teaching ability in order to be re-appointed. Adjunct professors are evaluated by the administration. Adjunct professors are not eligible to apply for sabbatical or faculty development grants, and are not required to contribute service to the Institute.\n\niii. **Research professors** are members of the staff, not of the faculty. They are appointed to and employed by a research center because of the distinctive contribution they can make to the research program of the Institute. They should have academic and/or professional qualifications comparable to those of faculty. Research professors enjoy staff status, but not regular faculty prerogatives such as voting privileges in the Faculty Assembly. The allowable or required level of participation in school faculty affairs shall be decided by the relevant school dean in consultation with the regular faculty.\n\niv. **Professors emeritae/i** are faculty members who have demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the regular faculty, relevant dean, and VPAA, excellence in teaching during their tenure at MIIS, maintained professional stature in their field, and made significant contributions to their graduate school. To be eligible for emerita/us status, a faculty member must normally meet the following additional criteria: (a) a minimum of ten years full-time service (or equivalent) at the Institute; (b) a desire and intent, expressed in person or in writing to the Faculty Senate, to maintain contact with the Institute; and (c) confirmation, again expressed in person or in writing to the Faculty Senate, that the candidate will not take a full-time, long-term teaching position at another university after retiring from MIIS. A retiring faculty member is normally nominated for emerita/us status by one or more current faculty members; this nomination is submitted to the Faculty Senate. Once the Faculty Senate is satisfied that the criteria are met, the nomination is presented to the Faculty Assembly for approval. The recommendation then proceeds to the VPAA for final approval. Professors emeritae/i enjoy certain privileges including, but not limited to, library and parking privileges, access to a computer and free use of the Internet. Professors emeritae/i are not eligible to apply for sabbatical or faculty development grants, **do not vote**, and are not expected to contribute service to the Institute.\n\nv. **Instructors in Non-degree Programs** are appointed to teach in specific non-degree programs for which they have relevant qualifications, experience and expertise. For appointment as an Instructor, a candidate must normally hold a Master’s degree and have a minimum of two years experience in the relevant field of specialization. Instructors are appointed to a one-year, renewable contract and are evaluated by the program supervisor. Instructors are not eligible to apply for sabbatical leave or faculty development grants, and do not serve on faculty committees.\n\n**<a name=\"appointment\" id=\"appointment\"></a>C.5.b. Appointment to the Faculty**\n\nAppointments to the regular faculty of the Institute are made by the VPAA, after review of the advice of a faculty search committee and of the recommendations of the appropriate school dean. No appointment to **regular** faculty status is made without an open search and a competitive evaluation following best practices of the Institute, including rigorous interviews with multiple candidates.\n\nFaculty appointments are subject to the approval of the Middlebury Board of Trustees through its consent agenda.\n\nWhen there are vacancies for regular faculty within a school, deans follow the hiring guidelines included in the Employee Handbook, beginning with a discussion with the VPAAto determine whether and how the vacancy is to be filled.\n\nAppointment of other categories of faculty proceeds as described below:\n\ni. The substantive criteria for regular faculty members are also applied to the appointment of **lecturers, senior lecturers, research professors, or visiting professors**. All such appointments shall be made in consultation with the regular faculty of the school or schools in which the appointments are made, except in the case of emergencies when insufficient time is available to involve faculty in the decision. Nominees are referred to the VPAA for approval and appointment. Notification to the regular faculty of the school or schools of non-reappointment is not required.\n\nii. Each school shall develop files of available faculty who may be hired as **adjuncts** as needed. All such appointments are made by the school dean, who shall consult the school faculty.\n\niii. In consultation with appropriate faculty, the dean of one of the schools may propose that the VPAA bestow the title of **research professor** on staff members of research centers who meet the criteria set forth in defining this position, above.\n\nIn forming a judgment as to the record and the potential of candidates for appointment, primary consideration is given to the following criteria:**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"></span>**\n\na. **Teaching ability**, as evidenced by appropriate references, student evaluations, and recommendations of peers.\n\nb. **Professional competence,** as evidenced by the candidate's educational record; scholarly activities such as publications, research, and papers presented at professional meetings; and reputation among peers in the field of specialization.\n\nc. **Personal attributes**, such as integrity, initiative, breadth and focus of intellectual interest, and willingness to advise and assist students and participate in Institute activities. This includes a judgment of the candidate’s ability to serve as a responsible Institute citizen, a quality colleague to faculty, a quality mentor to students, and a member of the Institute community who fosters its values and complies with its policies.\n\nAppointments to the three ranks are based on review of the various judgments of the members of the committee, the committee, and the administrators, respectively, as to specific qualifications outlined below.\n\ni. For appointment as a **Professor**, a candidate must have earned a doctorate in the relevant field of specialization. He or she must have demonstrated sustained high quality teaching, recognized scholarly and professional achievement (through a record of research, publication, and professional activities) and substantial service to the Institute, and must have at least ten (10) years of full-time teaching in institutions of higher education or equivalent professional service.\n\nii. For appointment as an **Associate** **Professor**, a candidate must have earned a doctorate in the relevant field of specialization. He or she must have demonstrated sustained high quality teaching, recognized scholarly and professional achievement (through a record of research, publication, and professional activities), and substantial service to the Institute, and must have at least five (5) years of full-time teaching in institutions of higher education or equivalent professional service.\n\niii. For appointment as an **Assistant** **Professor**, a candidate must have earned a doctorate in the relevant field of specialization. (Exceptions may be made for ABD candidates who will complete their doctorate by a stipulated date, normally not more than twelve (12) months from the date of appointment). He or she must demonstrate the potential for excellence in teaching, scholarly activities, professional achievement, and service to the Institute.\n\niv. Appointments to rank made before July 1, 2011 shall remain unaltered. That is, faculty members who hold an appointment prior to July 1, 2011 at one of the three ranks and do not meet the stipulated criterion in terms of the terminal degree shall retain that rank for the duration of their service at the Institute and may apply for promotion when all other conditions are met.\n\nv. Under special circumstances, based on the recommendation of the school dean after consultation with the school faculty, the VPAA may approve appointment of faculty at any of the above stages and ranks.\n\nIn 1982-83, a system of contracts for regular faculty (assistant Professors and above) was instituted in place of tenure. Tenure arrangements contracted before 1982 continue unaltered. Under the contract system, the first and second regular faculty appointments at the Institute are normally for a period of three (3) years each. The third such appointment is normally for six (6) years. All subsequent such appointments are normally for a six-year period.\n\n**C.5.c. Faculty Rights and Responsibilities**\n\n**Quality in teaching** is the first and most important responsibility of all Middlebury Institute faculty. Criteria for assessing if there is high teaching quality and other faculty responsibilities are described under Section 6 (Evaluation of the Faculty). Consistent with Institute policies, school faculty govern their school's academic programs and curriculum. Each school's faculty has the responsibility to organize itself for this purpose in a manner appropriate to the needs of the school’s professional graduate education.\n\nFaculty have **teaching autonomy**, including evaluation of student work, selection of teaching methods, selection of material to be presented, and maintenance of a class atmosphere conducive to learning, all subject to the policies of the Institute.\n\nThe Institute encourages a close relationship between teacher and student in the learning process. Overall responsibility for **academic advising** rests with the dean of advising, career and student services, but the school deans and their faculties are expected to play an important role as collaborators in this vital function. Faculty are expected to advise students in terms of the relevant academic disciplines and the students’ chosen areas of specific focus. Students who require non-academic counseling should be referred to the director of student affairs, who is responsible for student welfare in the areas of housing, referral services, international student advisement, and other personal counseling as appropriate.\n\nRegular faculty members are expected to participate meaningfully in events and activities that are essential to the Institute, the graduate schools, and the degree programs. These include, but are not limited to orientation, registration, convocation, commencement, committee work, and library development, as assigned.\n\nFaculty members shall submit grades and other reports prior to established deadlines.\n\nAll faculty members are expected to hold regularly scheduled **office hours** each week, because these are deemed to be necessary to uphold their instructional and advising obligations. As a courtesy to students and others, faculty members should post notice of their office hours and inform the appropriate school dean's assistant(s) of their schedules each academic term. Faculty are expected to accommodate reasonable requests from students with scheduling conflicts for appointments outside regular office hours.\n\nRegular faculty members with full-time appointments are expected to confine their **outside consultancies and non-Institute professional activities** to the equivalent of one (1) day a week during the academic year. They also may teach one course or its equivalent per term at another institution. Full-time faculty members who wish to teach for another institution must first obtain the consent of both the appropriate school dean and the VPAA. They may not teach any course that is, in the judgment of the dean and VPAA, in conflict with the interests of the Institute or in direct competition with the activities of the Institute.\n\nFaculty appointments for the academic year normally do not include commitments to **summer teaching**. However, with the approval of her/his dean, a faculty member may teach during the summer term in lieu of equivalent teaching in one of the semesters of the regular academic year. Should a faculty member wish to teach during the summer in addition to teaching during regular terms, she/he may do so at salary and/or under other terms as agreed with his/her dean. Should any faculty member wish to teach or consult elsewhere during the summer, she/he may not teach any course that is, in the judgment of the dean and VPAA, in conflict with the interests of the Institute or in direct competition with the activities of the Institute, and she/he must provide advance notice as outlined above. Regular faculty in the relevant school should be consulted, if possible, before adjunct or visiting faculty are hired for summer teaching.\n\nFaculty are expected to **conduct their research with integrity** and in line with standards of ethics that are commonly accepted within the academic community for proposing, conducting, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results. For the purpose of this document, we consider the term \"research\" to encompass both research and scholarship. Research misconduct means falsification, fabrication, plagiarism, retaliation of any kind against a person who in good faith reported or provided information about possible misconduct, or other actions that seriously deviate from commonly accepted standards of ethics. It does not include honest error or honest differences in interpretations or judgments of data.\n\nResearch involving **human and animal subjects** must first be reviewed by the Middlebury Institutional Review Board or [Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee](https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/resources/iacuc). The IRB includes several representatives from MIIS. The committee's procedures and forms are available at [https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/resources/irb](https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/resources/irb). Further information may be obtained from the MIIS VPAA.\n\nFaculty **make recommendations regarding the awarding of degrees**, in accordance with the Institute’s degree requirements. All earned academic degrees are conferred by the VPAA of the Middlebury Institute upon recommendation of the faculty and approval of the Institute Board of Overseers and the Middlebury Board of Trustees.\n\nThe honorary degree awarded by the Institute is the Doctor of Humane Letters, _Honoris Causa_. It is awarded to individuals who meet at least one of the following qualifications:\n\n- conspicuous contributions to international affairs;\n- conspicuous contributions to education and/or scholarship;\n- conspicuous contributions to the Institute.\n\nFaculty members may **propose candidates for honorary degrees** to the Faculty Senate for recommendation to the VPAA and the president of Middlebury.\n","excerpt":"C.5.a.

Demonstrated Teaching Effectiveness (40-60%)** - The Institute is a professional graduate school, focused on preparing students for their professional lives. Accordingly, the first priority of Institute faculty is effective teaching and this category receives the greatest weight in assessing overall faculty performance.  Effective teaching requires faculty, at a minimum, to:\n\n1.  Maintain up-to-date knowledge of the subject matter\n2.  Demonstrate ability to facilitate meaningful discussion, reflection, and skills practice\n3.  Structure courses in ways that align learning outcomes, course content, and assignments\n4.  Apply an intentional, educationally-sound teaching philosophy\n5.  Demonstrate ability to assess student learning and communicate feedback to students\n6.  Communicate clearly with students in and outside of the classroom\n7.  Foster an atmosphere of respect\n8.  Be inclusive of diverse students and learning styles\n9.  Maintain high academic standards that require students to make progress towards producing professional-level work\n10. Submit required Institute reports, such as semester grades, on a timely basis\n\nSources of input: Evaluation of teaching will assess both quantity (number of courses, number of new course preps, number of students, number of directed studies, number of demanding courses (as designated by the school), etc.) as well as the quality of teaching. It is essential that there are multiple sources of data used in the evaluation of teaching quality. These sources must represent multiple perspectives (e.g. the faculty member being evaluated, students, peers, and administrators). The faculty and academic administration shall jointly agree on appropriate data sources and processes for the assessment of teaching.\n\n**ii. Scholarship and Professional Impact (20-50%)** -  As a professional graduate school, one of the Institute’s greatest assets is the professional engagement of its faculty. This category evaluates the professional impact that faculty members make in their academic and professional fields and in the local and global communities.  Positive scholarship and professional impact increases the visibility and reputation of the Institute. Forms of professional impact include, but are not limited to:\n\n1.  Research, publications, or conference presentations that advance theoretical knowledge, inform professional practice, and/or shape public policy\n2.  Editorial roles with academic journals\n3.  Professional consulting work\n4.  Development of curriculum or facilitation of trainings that advance others’ professional practice\n5.  Leadership roles in professional organizations and conferences\n6.  Projects that meaningfully connect the Institute with local or global community people and groups\n7.  Mentoring professionals outside of MIIS\n8.  Volunteer service, in the local community and beyond, related to the faculty members’ academic or professional field\n9.  Highly public activities such as media interviews, well-read blogs/podcasts, and related activities\n\nSources of input: Data on scholarship and professional impact will be reported by the faculty member during annual evaluations. At the time of contract renewal and promotion, additional perspectives, including external perspectives, will also be incorporated into the evaluation. Awards and recognitions may also factor into assessment of professional impact. The faculty and academic administration shall jointly agree on appropriate methods of assessing the merits of the faculty members’ contributions in this category. **<span></span>**\n\n**iii. Service to the Institute and to Middlebury** **(10-30%)** - Contributions of the faculty are essential to Middlebury’s operations, strategy, and success as an organization. This category evaluates faculty contributions to Middlebury. It includes contributions other than those described in the categories of teaching and professional impact.  Service to Middlebury and the Institute will at minimum include regular participation in governance and community building activities. These include faculty assemblies, town hall events, faculty retreats, orientation, commencement, faculty meetings, and program events.  Additionally, faculty may contribute to Middlebury and the Institute through both individual and group efforts including, but not limited to:\n\n1.  Student support and advising\n2.  Career advising\n3.  Fellowship search committees\n4.  Club advising\n5.  Participation in student-organized events\n6.  Supporting student research and conference presentations\n7.  Creating professional development opportunities for students\n8.  Mentoring students\n9.  Middlebury and Institute leadership roles\n10. Directing a center\n11. Program chairs and language coordinators\n12. Faculty Senate\n13. APSIC\n14. FEC\n15. Chairing committees and task groups\n16. Other leadership roles\n17. Contributing to strategy and operations\n18. Serving on peer review committees\n19. Serving on search committees\n20. Serving on committees and task groups\n21. Developing program and Institute curriculum\n22. Supporting center initiatives\n23. Participating in focus groups and planning meetings\n24. Mentoring or training Institute faculty or staff\n25. Bringing resources into the organization\n26. Participation in marketing and recruitment efforts\n27. Working with donors\n28. Applying for and receiving grants that benefit Middlebury and the Institute\n29. Developing and/or coordinating non-degree programs and initiatives\n30. Hosting alumni events\n\nSources of input: Data on Middlebury/MIIS Service will be reported by the faculty member being evaluated and confirmed by the Dean. The faculty and academic administration shall jointly agree on appropriate methods of assessing the merits of the faculty members’ contributions in this category.\n\n**iv. Professional Development (0-20%)** - A hallmark of professionals is that they continually develop and update their knowledge and skills. Intentional, ongoing professional development is expected of all Institute faculty. It is expected that each faculty member will seek improvement in one (or more) of the other three evaluation categories, with recognizable efforts annually. Professional development goals may include, but are not limited to:\n\n1.  Teaching\n2.  Learning a new content area\n3.  Developing, or substantially revising, a course\n4.  Learning about diversity and inclusion in the classroom\n5.  Learning classroom facilitation techniques\n6.  Developing or improving learning assessments\n7.  Testing a new teaching technique or technology\n8.  Scholarship and Professional impact\n9.  Formulating a research agenda\n10. Developing, or deepening, a research area\n11. Learning a new research method or tool\n12. Participating in writing accountability group\n13. Developing a consulting business plan\n14. Developing a professional website, blog, etc.\n15. Receiving training on engaging with journalists\n16. Undertaking new professional roles\n17. Middlebury/MIIS Service\n18. Taking management training\n19. Improving meeting facilitation skills\n20. Taking grant-writing training\n21. Undertaking new institutional roles\n22. Cross-category/Other\n23. Participating in mentorship as a mentee or in a peer-to-peer program\n24. Participating in professional development trainings (time-management, conflict resolution, leadership, etc.)\n25. Taking diversity training\n26. Taking a MIIS or external course\n27. Developing foreign language skills\n\nSources of input: Professional Development goals and progress may be reported by the faculty member being evaluated. Professional development activities may not be “double-counted” by reporting them in both the professional development category and another evaluation category. Each faculty member will set one or more goal(s) during the annual evaluation process and report on progress during the next annual evaluation. It is recognized that meaningful professional development is a multi-year process. Therefore, striving for an ambitious goal and not fully succeeding will not be penalized. Further, it is acknowledged that goals evolve and may change completely as new opportunities emerge.**<span></span>**\n\n**C.6.b. Weighting Criteria**\n\nThe above elements are not mutually exclusive. While demonstrated excellence in all is not necessary, outstanding achievement in some and adequate accomplishment in the remainder is expected of all members of the faculty. However, effective teaching is always essential.\n\nAll criteria necessarily include the faculty member’s behavior as a responsible Institute citizen, including serving as a quality colleague to faculty, a quality mentor to students, and an Institute community member who fosters its values and complies with its policies.\n\nSchool deans, in consultation with the faculty of each degree program and the VPAA, shall establish clear guidelines for any weighting of criteria applicable to faculty evaluations in their schools.\n\n**C.6.c. Tracking**\n\nThe VPAAis responsible for recording all information related to the evaluation process, including the calendar and list of faculty to be evaluated, the dates each file was forwarded and received by participants in the process, and the decisions reached at each level.\n\n**C.6.d. Commencement of evaluation process**\n\nThe VPAA’s office notifies each faculty member in writing, by September 1, of the faculty member’s obligations with respect to the particular type of evaluation (annual review, contract renewal, or promotion action) that is to be undertaken in a given year. [Appendix A](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/appendix-a-faculty-evaluation-schedule) provides a schedule that academic administration, the Faculty Evaluation Committee, and faculty being reviewed should follow. By the date stipulated on this calendar, faculty members shall submit reports on their activities (Faculty Activity Reports or FARs) based on the five criteria described in section [C.6.a.](#criteria) FARs assist the academic administration and the Faculty Evaluation Committee in evaluating the record and the potential of the faculty members. Each school prescribes a template that clearly defines what is expected of faculty in this report.\n\n**C.6.e. Annual Reviews**\n\nDuring the academic year, every member of the regular faculty or visiting faculty member on a multi-year contract (those holding a contract two-three years in length), receives an annual review. These evaluations are conducted by the appropriate school deans, who rely on the Faculty Activity Reports (FARs) that each faculty member is required to provide annually to the dean. The annual review is based on a process mutually agreed upon with the school faculty, which shall include written comments from the school dean on the faculty member’s progress in the five criteria above, his/her strengths, and the areas in which improvement is needed. School deans are responsible for ensuring that each faculty member has received a copy of this review and has had an opportunity to respond to it in writing. These reviews and any responses shall become part of the faculty member’s personnel file. In the event of a disagreement, the evaluated faculty member may request that an annual review be forwarded to the Faculty Evaluation Committee for its independent evaluation. Such assessment shall be added to the faculty member’s file. See [Appendix A](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/appendix-a-faculty-evaluation-schedule) for timetable for Annual Reviews.\n\n**C.6.f. Contract renewals**\n\nFor faculty on multiple-year contracts, applications for renewal of their contracts shall be reviewed and decision made by no later than 12 months prior to the expiration of their current contract (no later than June 30, the normal expiration date). This means that for faculty serving a six-academic-year contract, the review and decision shall be completed during their **fifth** academic year of service under such contract, etc. In the case of a decision for non-retention, the faculty member shall be informed by the date indicated in [Appendix A](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/appendix-a-faculty-evaluation-schedule) during the year preceding the one in which the contract expires. Failure to provide timely notification of such a decision results automatically in the offer of an extension of one academic year to the current contract.\n\nIf contracts are renewed, faculty should be provided a copy of this new contract to be signed, specifying the terms of employment, starting salary, title, and start and end dates, accompanying the reappointment letter.**<span></span>**\n\n**<a name=\"promotion\" id=\"promotion\"></a>C.6.g. Promotion**\n\nRequests for promotions shall be considered according to the schedule in [Appendix A](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/appendix-a-faculty-evaluation-schedule). Faculty members may apply and be considered for promotion in accordance with the following schedules and criteria:\n\ni. **Lecturer**, for promotion to **senior lecturer**, at any time after meeting the requirement for appointment to the rank of Senior Lecturer (section [C.5.a.](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/5-policies-and-procedures-for-members-of-the-faculty#categories)).\n\nii. **Lecturer** or **senior lecturer**, for appointment as **assistant** or **associate professor**, after completion of the doctoral degree (section [C.5.a.](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/5-policies-and-procedures-for-members-of-the-faculty#categories)).\n\niii. **Assistant professor (or assistant professors of professional practice),** for promotion to **associate professor (or associate professors of professional practice)**, after four (4) years in rank, if at least two (2) of those years have been completed at the Institute, and after a total of at least five (5) years of full-time teaching or equivalent professional experience. Application for promotion can be made in the spring semester of the fifth year and promotion, if awarded, shall become effective at the start of the sixth year.\n\niv. **Associate professors (or associate professors of professional practice)**, can apply for promotion to **full** **professor (or full professor of professional practice)**, in either of the following cases:\n\n1] For those who joined MIIS faculty as an associate professor they are eligible to apply after four (4) years in rank at the associate level, if at least three (3) of those years have been completed at the Institute.\n\n<span>2] For those who joined MIIS faculty as an assistant professor, they are eligible to apply after completing nine (9) years of full-time teaching at accredited institutions of higher learning, or, if they are professors of professional practice, equivalent professional experience, and after four (4) years in rank at the associate level at the Institute.</span>\n\n<span>Application for promotion to full professor can be made at earliest in the spring semester of the first academic year in which they have met the above criteria. If awarded, faculty will be notified of promotion by the end of that spring semester in the academic year in which they apply, and promotion shall become effective at the start of the following academic year (July 1st).</span>\n\nAmong the considerations for promotion are the criteria for measuring excellence mentioned in Section [C.6.a.](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/6-evaluation-of-the-faculty#criteria), as well as any further guidance established in each school. The principal determining factors for promotion for all faculty members, however, are excellence in teaching and validation of professional status, as determined by the individual school. Promotion to associate professor or professor requires evidence of significant contributions to the objectives of the Institute.\n\nAll such criteria include the faculty member’s behavior as a responsible Institute citizen, including serving as a quality colleague to faculty members, quality mentor to students, and Institute community member who fosters its values and complies with its policies.  Early promotion may be considered in cases of exceptional merit.\n\n**<a name=\"eval-process\" id=\"eval-process\"></a>C.6.h. The Process of Evaluation**\n\nEvaluation of faculty members for the purpose of contract renewal or promotion is a sequential process involving review by a committee of peers, the relevant dean (GSTILE, GSIPM, LPP), the Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC), the VPAA, the provost, and the president and Board of Trustees in the case of promotion to full professor. The faculty member has opportunities to respond at each stage of the process.  In cases of promotion, external reviews by qualified persons of adequate professional/academic standing are also required.\n\n**Step 1 —** To initiate the evaluation process for promotion or contract renewal, faculty members prepare and submit their professional files to their relevant deans according to the schedule set forth in Appendix A.\n\nA complete file shall contain, but is not limited to, the following items:\n\n- the annual Faculty Activity Report (FAR) based on the criteria in Section [C.6.a.](#criteria);\n- evidence of teaching effectiveness (quantitative and qualitative student evaluations, and optionally course syllabi, sample assignments, student work, teaching philosophy statement);\n- samples of publications;\n- other evidence of professional currency and activity;\n- community service, fundraising, etc.;\n- letters of recommendation (optional).\n\nIt is the individual faculty member’s responsibility to initiate the evaluation process by submitting a complete, well-organized file by the deadline specified in the evaluation schedule ([Appendix A](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/appendix-a-faculty-evaluation-schedule)). Should timely action not be taken by a faculty member, the relevant dean shall combine the relevant student course evaluation data and annual reviews into a rudimentary dossier, which is forwarded to the Peer Review Committee.\n\n**<a name=\"step2\" id=\"step2\"></a>Step 2 –** The process of forming the Peer Review Committees, including the role, if any, of the program chairs, shall be as agreed upon between the dean and the faculty of each school. Members of the committee shall be regular faculty members who, in the judgment of the dean, possess the professional expertise to evaluate the dossier. In the event that for good cause shown to the satisfaction of the VPAA, a candidate objects to a committee member’s participation, the VPAA shall direct that a replacement be appointed.\n\nThe Peer Review Committee shall evaluate the faculty member’s record and present to the dean a written report, inclusive of its recommendation (contract renewal/non-renewal, promotion/non-promotion, or approval/non-approval of a sabbatical proposal).\n\nOn the same date the Peer Review Committee recommendation is sent to the dean, a copy is forwarded to the faculty member, who has five (5) working days in which to submit a response to the committee’s evaluation and/or additional information to the relevant dean. This period may be extended if the faculty member is unavailable to receive and comment on the report.\n\n**Step 2a** – The soliciting of external reviews in cases of promotion review shall be the responsibility of the VPAA. To this end, the faculty member and the relevant dean shall both submit a list of names, including contact information, of three persons possessing adequate professional/academic expertise and qualifications to evaluate the dossier and to judge also on the basis of the mission of the program with which the candidate is affiliated. External reviewers should be established scholars in the candidate’s field, or leaders in the profession.  In order to guarantee sufficient time and to facilitate the process, the name lists must be submitted to the VPAA no later than October 1\\. The VPAA shall then obtain a written evaluation from one person on each list.\n\nThe external reviewers shall confine their evaluation to the faculty member’s record of scholarship/professional achievement as well as professional stature and present to the VPAA a written report, inclusive of their recommendation (promotion/non-promotion).\n\nThe external reviews shall be obtained in a period of time concurrent with the peer-review process. The faculty member will have access to the opinions of the external reviewers, but not to the external reviewers’ identities, thus preserving the confidentiality of the process. Restricting access is meant to ensure frank and honest assessments of the candidate, while still providing useful input into the faculty member’s formative evaluation.  The deans, FEC, and VPAA will have access to all materials submitted in connection with promotion review, including the external evaluations.\n\n**<a name=\"step3\" id=\"step3\"></a>Step 3 —** The relevant dean, whose review must explicitly acknowledge the candidate’s written response(s), if any, adds his/her evaluation of the faculty member to the file and forwards it to the **Faculty Evaluation Committee**. The dean’s final evaluation shall be issued no sooner than five (5) working days after receiving the peer evaluation and the external reviews in cases of promotion.\n\nOn the same date, a copy of the dean’s evaluation is sent by the relevant dean directly to the faculty member, who has five (5) working days in which to submit, to the **Faculty Evaluation Committee**, a response to the dean’s evaluation. This period may be extended if the faculty member is unavailable to receive and comment on the report.\n\n**Step 4 —** The Faculty Evaluation Committee will review the file, explicitly acknowledging any written responses and othermaterials from the faculty member. The Committee may request additional information from any party involved in the case.If the Committee finds that the faculty member has not been accorded due process during the evaluation procedure, it shall forward such a finding to the VPAA, with copies forwarded to the relevant dean and to the faculty member on the same date. In doing so, the Committee shall consider whether in its judgment, the evaluation has proceeded in accordance with policies of the Faculty Handbook.\n\nUnless the Faculty Evaluation Committee finds that the faculty member has not been accorded due process during the prior evaluation procedure, it will then make its own independent evaluation. The Committee shall issue its final evaluation no sooner than five (5) working days after receiving the file from the **dean.** The Faculty Evaluation Committee’s independent evaluation may take one of three forms: (a) concurrence with the recommendations of the relevant dean; (b) non-concurrence with the recommendation of the relevant dean; or (c) a recommendation, for reasons stated, that the VPAA invoke the one-year extension provision (see section 6.10) or, under special circumstances, a longer extension to provide the faculty member sufficient time to demonstrate enhanced performance.\n\n**Step 5** — The Faculty Evaluation Committee places its finding of due process and its evaluation of the faculty member in the file, with copies forwarded to the faculty member, the relevant dean and the VPAAon the same date. The faculty member has five (5) working days in which to submit a response to the Committee’s evaluation and/or additional material to the VPAA.\n\nThe VPAA, whose review must explicitly acknowledge any written response from the candidate submitted within five (5) days of the Faculty Evaluation Committee's decision, shall issue a final report including evaluation of the file and recommendation, no sooner than five (5) working days after receipt of the file. This report is added to the file, with copies forwarded to the faculty member **and** the relevant dean on the same date.\n\nIn the case of renewal of a contract, the VPAA will make a recommendation to the provost.  The provost will make the decision about the contract renewal.\n\nIn the case of promotion to full professor, the recommendation will be forwarded to the president, who, in consultation with the provost, will make a decision, with the final decision to be made by the Board of Trustees.\n\n**Step 6** — In cases other than promotion to full professor, should the faculty member disagree with the decision of the provost, they may appeal the decision in writing to the president within five (5) working days of being notified of the decision. The decision of the president is final.\n\nA faculty member being evaluated may request an additional five (5) days in addition to the five (5) working days provided, for the purpose of obtaining materials deemed critical to the case.\n\n**C.6.i. Sabbatical Leaves**\n\nThe Institute provides opportunities for professional development and research through faculty sabbatical leaves, subject to available financial resources and program requirements.\n\nAfter each six (6) year period of full-time (or full-time equivalent) teaching at the Institute, faculty members become eligible to apply for a sabbatical leave. [See Appendix C]  Application for sabbatical leave is made in the fall semester of the sixth year of full-time teaching (or full-time equivalent) and, if granted, leave commences in the seventh year.  Before applying for a subsequent sabbatical leave, faculty members must again complete a minimum of six (6) years of full-time (or full-time equivalent) teaching. <span></span> <span>If sabbatical is taken in the fall semester of an academic year only, the spring semester does not count as part of this next six (6) year increment of full-time teaching.  </span>\n\n<span>In the event that a faculty member is not able to take sabbatical when eligible, for reasons of institutional need or world events beyond their control, the academic administration shall have the right to allow the faculty member to be eligible for the next sabbatical as would have been originally scheduled (e.g. if a 7th year sabbatical is deferred to year 8, the administration may allow the individual to be eligible again within year 14, rather than waiting until year 15).</span>\n\nFaculty members must make formal application for a sabbatical leave through their relevant deans, who forward requests to the Faculty Evaluation Committee. The VPAA takes action based on the recommendation of the Faculty Evaluation Committee **and** relevant dean, and on the needs of the Institute. Applications should be made before September 30 of the year preceding the academic year for which the leave is requested. The process for review of sabbatical proposals is the same as the process for review of applications for contract renewal or promotion, beginning with [step 3](#step3).\n\nThe principal criteria considered for the granting of sabbatical leave include: the nature and quality of the research or professional project proposed by the candidate for the period of the sabbatical; the utility of the project to the applicant's professional growth and to the reputation and academic programs at the Institute; and the ability of the Institute to continue its academic programs during the absence of the professor seeking a sabbatical. Faculty members who are granted sabbatical leaves normally are obligated to return to their regular teaching positions at the Institute for at least one (1) year following the sabbatical and to give a full report on their research or other activities during the sabbatical (for example in a poster fair, presentation, or colloquium).\n\nSchools may modify these criteria for sabbatical leaves to support the specific mission and objectives of the school. In that event, relevant deans, in consultation with their faculty and the VPAA, shall establish clear guidelines for framing such sabbatical leave criteria.\n\nSabbatical leave may be granted for an entire academic year at fifty percent (50%) of the annual salary or for one (1) semester at full salary. The sabbatical period shall be counted as time served at the Institute for the purposes of calculating promotion and contract renewal periods. The Institute shall continue the faculty member's health and retirement benefits during the sabbatical under the same terms as during regular service at the Institute.\n\nIn the event that a faculty member’s request for a sabbatical leave is denied by the relevant dean, the Faculty Evaluation Committee shall evaluate the request independently, based on the Institute criteria and any modifications made therein by the school, as described above.\n\n**C.6.j. Role of the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Institute (VPAA)**\n\nThe VPAA of the Institute has approval/denial authority for all faculty sabbaticals, and recommends faculty contract renewals, promotions, and re-appointments of deans to the provost, subject in some cases to review by president or Board of Trustees, as outlined in the procedure above. The VPAA may elect to recommend an extension of an existing contract up to one (1) year, or, under special circumstances, a longer extension in those cases when it is judged that more time is needed to evaluate faculty performance for a contract renewal decision.\n\n**C.6.k. Leave without Pay**\n\nIn its continuing efforts to provide its faculty with opportunities for professional research and development, the Institute shall consider options for academic leave without pay on a case-by-case basis. A faculty member may apply for leave without pay, normally before September 15 of the year preceding the academic year in which the leave is requested, by submitting formal written application to the VPAA through the relevant dean. Leave taken without pay shall not be considered time served at the Institute for purposes of calculating promotion and contract renewal periods, and benefits shall be suspended for the length of the leave. However, under extraordinary circumstances at the discretion of the VPAA, as long as the faculty member takes leave without pay for one year or less, the VPAA may allow the faculty member to count that leave as time served towards contract renewal, sabbatical, and/or promotion.\n","excerpt":"Evaluation of the faculty serves several Institute objectives, such as assuring and assessing educational effectiveness, providing…","html":"<p>Evaluation of the faculty serves several Institute objectives, such as assuring and assessing educational effectiveness, providing performance feedback, developing faculty expertise, improving classroom performance, maintaining fairness, and documenting the basis for employment decisions.</p>\n<p>Faculty are formally evaluated according to the procedures outlined below on three specific occasions. First, each year every regular faculty member or visiting faculty member on a multi-year contract (those holding a contract two-three years in length), is given an annual review by her/his school dean. Program chairs and language coordinators do not normally evaluate their faculty in the annual reviews. If a program decides they do want their program chair or language coordinator to contribute to the annual evaluation report, the faculty should have a right to review these comments just as they can view the dean's comments on their annual evaluation report. Second, each regular faculty member is evaluated for contract renewal. Third, the evaluation process is applied to all promotions. The evaluation process is based in part on judgments made upon the review of regularly administered end-of-semester student evaluations and upon peer faculty reviews.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"criteria\" id=\"criteria\"></a>C.6.a. Criteria</strong></p>\n<p>Evaluation is based on the following criteria:</p>\n<p><strong>i. Demonstrated Teaching Effectiveness (40-60%)</strong> - The Institute is a professional graduate school, focused on preparing students for their professional lives. Accordingly, the first priority of Institute faculty is effective teaching and this category receives the greatest weight in assessing overall faculty performance.  Effective teaching requires faculty, at a minimum, to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Maintain up-to-date knowledge of the subject matter</li>\n<li>Demonstrate ability to facilitate meaningful discussion, reflection, and skills practice</li>\n<li>Structure courses in ways that align learning outcomes, course content, and assignments</li>\n<li>Apply an intentional, educationally-sound teaching philosophy</li>\n<li>Demonstrate ability to assess student learning and communicate feedback to students</li>\n<li>Communicate clearly with students in and outside of the classroom</li>\n<li>Foster an atmosphere of respect</li>\n<li>Be inclusive of diverse students and learning styles</li>\n<li>Maintain high academic standards that require students to make progress towards producing professional-level work</li>\n<li>Submit required Institute reports, such as semester grades, on a timely basis</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sources of input: Evaluation of teaching will assess both quantity (number of courses, number of new course preps, number of students, number of directed studies, number of demanding courses (as designated by the school), etc.) as well as the quality of teaching. It is essential that there are multiple sources of data used in the evaluation of teaching quality. These sources must represent multiple perspectives (e.g. the faculty member being evaluated, students, peers, and administrators). The faculty and academic administration shall jointly agree on appropriate data sources and processes for the assessment of teaching.</p>\n<p><strong>ii. Scholarship and Professional Impact (20-50%)</strong> -  As a professional graduate school, one of the Institute’s greatest assets is the professional engagement of its faculty. This category evaluates the professional impact that faculty members make in their academic and professional fields and in the local and global communities.  Positive scholarship and professional impact increases the visibility and reputation of the Institute. Forms of professional impact include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Research, publications, or conference presentations that advance theoretical knowledge, inform professional practice, and/or shape public policy</li>\n<li>Editorial roles with academic journals</li>\n<li>Professional consulting work</li>\n<li>Development of curriculum or facilitation of trainings that advance others’ professional practice</li>\n<li>Leadership roles in professional organizations and conferences</li>\n<li>Projects that meaningfully connect the Institute with local or global community people and groups</li>\n<li>Mentoring professionals outside of MIIS</li>\n<li>Volunteer service, in the local community and beyond, related to the faculty members’ academic or professional field</li>\n<li>Highly public activities such as media interviews, well-read blogs/podcasts, and related activities</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sources of input: Data on scholarship and professional impact will be reported by the faculty member during annual evaluations. At the time of contract renewal and promotion, additional perspectives, including external perspectives, will also be incorporated into the evaluation. Awards and recognitions may also factor into assessment of professional impact. The faculty and academic administration shall jointly agree on appropriate methods of assessing the merits of the faculty members’ contributions in this category. <strong><span></span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>iii. Service to the Institute and to Middlebury</strong> <strong>(10-30%)</strong> - Contributions of the faculty are essential to Middlebury’s operations, strategy, and success as an organization. This category evaluates faculty contributions to Middlebury. It includes contributions other than those described in the categories of teaching and professional impact.  Service to Middlebury and the Institute will at minimum include regular participation in governance and community building activities. These include faculty assemblies, town hall events, faculty retreats, orientation, commencement, faculty meetings, and program events.  Additionally, faculty may contribute to Middlebury and the Institute through both individual and group efforts including, but not limited to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Student support and advising</li>\n<li>Career advising</li>\n<li>Fellowship search committees</li>\n<li>Club advising</li>\n<li>Participation in student-organized events</li>\n<li>Supporting student research and conference presentations</li>\n<li>Creating professional development opportunities for students</li>\n<li>Mentoring students</li>\n<li>Middlebury and Institute leadership roles</li>\n<li>Directing a center</li>\n<li>Program chairs and language coordinators</li>\n<li>Faculty Senate</li>\n<li>APSIC</li>\n<li>FEC</li>\n<li>Chairing committees and task groups</li>\n<li>Other leadership roles</li>\n<li>Contributing to strategy and operations</li>\n<li>Serving on peer review committees</li>\n<li>Serving on search committees</li>\n<li>Serving on committees and task groups</li>\n<li>Developing program and Institute curriculum</li>\n<li>Supporting center initiatives</li>\n<li>Participating in focus groups and planning meetings</li>\n<li>Mentoring or training Institute faculty or staff</li>\n<li>Bringing resources into the organization</li>\n<li>Participation in marketing and recruitment efforts</li>\n<li>Working with donors</li>\n<li>Applying for and receiving grants that benefit Middlebury and the Institute</li>\n<li>Developing and/or coordinating non-degree programs and initiatives</li>\n<li>Hosting alumni events</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sources of input: Data on Middlebury/MIIS Service will be reported by the faculty member being evaluated and confirmed by the Dean.

Professional Development (0-20%)</strong> - A hallmark of professionals is that they continually develop and update their knowledge and skills. Intentional, ongoing professional development is expected of all Institute faculty. It is expected that each faculty member will seek improvement in one (or more) of the other three evaluation categories, with recognizable efforts annually. Professional development goals may include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Teaching</li>\n<li>Learning a new content area</li>\n<li>Developing, or substantially revising, a course</li>\n<li>Learning about diversity and inclusion in the classroom</li>\n<li>Learning classroom facilitation techniques</li>\n<li>Developing or improving learning assessments</li>\n<li>Testing a new teaching technique or technology</li>\n<li>Scholarship and Professional impact</li>\n<li>Formulating a research agenda</li>\n<li>Developing, or deepening, a research area</li>\n<li>Learning a new research method or tool</li>\n<li>Participating in writing accountability group</li>\n<li>Developing a consulting business plan</li>\n<li>Developing a professional website, blog, etc.</li>\n<li>Receiving training on engaging with journalists</li>\n<li>Undertaking new professional roles</li>\n<li>Middlebury/MIIS Service</li>\n<li>Taking management training</li>\n<li>Improving meeting facilitation skills</li>\n<li>Taking grant-writing training</li>\n<li>Undertaking new institutional roles</li>\n<li>Cross-category/Other</li>\n<li>Participating in mentorship as a mentee or in a peer-to-peer program</li>\n<li>Participating in professional development trainings (time-management, conflict resolution, leadership, etc.)</li>\n<li>Taking diversity training</li>\n<li>Taking a MIIS or external course</li>\n<li>Developing foreign language skills</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sources of input: Professional Development goals and progress may be reported by the faculty member being evaluated. Professional development activities may not be “double-counted” by reporting them in both the professional development category and another evaluation category. Each faculty member will set one or more goal(s) during the annual evaluation process and report on progress during the next annual evaluation. It is recognized that meaningful professional development is a multi-year process. Therefore, striving for an ambitious goal and not fully succeeding will not be penalized. Further, it is acknowledged that goals evolve and may change completely as new opportunities emerge.<strong><span></span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>C.6.b. Weighting Criteria</strong></p>\n<p>The above elements are not mutually exclusive. While demonstrated excellence in all is not necessary, outstanding achievement in some and adequate accomplishment in the remainder is expected of all members of the faculty. However, effective teaching is always essential.</p>\n<p>All criteria necessarily include the faculty member’s behavior as a responsible Institute citizen, including serving as a quality colleague to faculty, a quality mentor to students, and an Institute community member who fosters its values and complies with its policies.</p>\n<p>School deans, in consultation with the faculty of each degree program and the VPAA, shall establish clear guidelines for any weighting of criteria applicable to faculty evaluations in their schools.</p>\n<p><strong>C.6.c. Tracking</strong></p>\n<p>The VPAAis responsible for recording all information related to the evaluation process, including the calendar and list of faculty to be evaluated, the dates each file was forwarded and received by participants in the process, and the decisions reached at each level.</p>\n<p><strong>C.6.d. Commencement of evaluation process</strong></p>\n<p>The VPAA’s office notifies each faculty member in writing, by September 1, of the faculty member’s obligations with respect to the particular type of evaluation (annual review, contract renewal, or promotion action) that is to be undertaken in a given year. <a href=\"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/appendix-a-faculty-evaluation-schedule\">Appendix A</a> provides a schedule that academic administration, the Faculty Evaluation Committee, and faculty being reviewed should follow. By the date stipulated on this calendar, faculty members shall submit reports on their activities (Faculty Activity Reports or FARs) based on the five criteria described in section <a href=\"#criteria\">C.6.a.</a> FARs assist the academic administration and the Faculty Evaluation Committee in evaluating the record and the potential of the faculty members. Each school prescribes a template that clearly defines what is expected of faculty in this report.</p>\n<p><strong>C.6.e. Annual Reviews</strong></p>\n<p>During the academic year, every member of the regular faculty or visiting faculty member on a multi-year contract (those holding a contract two-three years in length), receives an annual review. These evaluations are conducted by the appropriate school deans, who rely on the Faculty Activity Reports (FARs) that each faculty member is required to provide annually to the dean. The annual review is based on a process mutually agreed upon with the school faculty, which shall include written comments from the school dean on the faculty member’s progress in the five criteria above, his/her strengths, and the areas in which improvement is needed. School deans are responsible for ensuring that each faculty member has received a copy of this review and has had an opportunity to respond to it in writing. These reviews and any responses shall become part of the faculty member’s personnel file. In the event of a disagreement, the evaluated faculty member may request that an annual review be forwarded to the Faculty Evaluation Committee for its independent evaluation. Such assessment shall be added to the faculty member’s file. See <a href=\"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/appendix-a-faculty-evaluation-schedule\">Appendix A</a> for timetable for Annual Reviews.</p>\n<p><strong>C.6.f. Contract renewals</strong></p>\n<p>For faculty on multiple-year contracts, applications for renewal of their contracts shall be reviewed and decision made by no later than 12 months prior to the expiration of their current contract (no later than June 30, the normal expiration date). This means that for faculty serving a six-academic-year contract, the review and decision shall be completed during their <strong>fifth</strong> academic year of service under such contract, etc. In the case of a decision for non-retention, the faculty member shall be informed by the date indicated in <a href=\"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/appendix-a-faculty-evaluation-schedule\">Appendix A</a> during the year preceding the one in which the contract expires. Failure to provide timely notification of such a decision results automatically in the offer of an extension of one academic year to the current contract.</p>\n<p>If contracts are renewed, faculty should be provided a copy of this new contract to be signed, specifying the terms of employment, starting salary, title, and start and end dates, accompanying the reappointment letter.<strong><span></span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"promotion\" id=\"promotion\"></a>C.6.g. Promotion</strong></p>\n<p>Requests for promotions shall be considered according to the schedule in <a href=\"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/appendix-a-faculty-evaluation-schedule\">Appendix A</a>. Faculty members may apply and be considered for promotion in accordance with the following schedules and criteria:</p>\n<p>i. <strong>Lecturer</strong>, for promotion to <strong>senior lecturer</strong>, at any time after meeting the requirement for appointment to the rank of Senior Lecturer (section <a href=\"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/5-policies-and-procedures-for-members-of-the-faculty#categories\">C.5.a.</a>).</p>\n<p>ii. <strong>Lecturer</strong> or <strong>senior lecturer</strong>, for appointment as <strong>assistant</strong> or <strong>associate professor</strong>, after completion of the doctoral degree (section <a href=\"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/5-policies-and-procedures-for-members-of-the-faculty#categories\">C.5.a.</a>).</p>\n<p>iii. <strong>Assistant professor (or assistant professors of professional practice),</strong> for promotion to <strong>associate professor (or associate professors of professional practice)</strong>, after four (4) years in rank, if at least two (2) of those years have been completed at the Institute, and after a total of at least five (5) years of full-time teaching or equivalent professional experience. Application for promotion can be made in the spring semester of the fifth year and promotion, if awarded, shall become effective at the start of the sixth year.</p>\n<p>iv. <strong>Associate professors (or associate professors of professional practice)</strong>, can apply for promotion to <strong>full</strong> <strong>professor (or full professor of professional practice)</strong>, in either of the following cases:</p>\n<p>1] For those who joined MIIS faculty as an associate professor they are eligible to apply after four (4) years in rank at the associate level, if at least three (3) of those years have been completed at the Institute.</p>\n<p><span>2] For those who joined MIIS faculty as an assistant professor, they are eligible to apply after completing nine (9) years of full-time teaching at accredited institutions of higher learning, or, if they are professors of professional practice, equivalent professional experience, and after four (4) years in rank at the associate level at the Institute.</span></p>\n<p><span>Application for promotion to full professor can be made at earliest in the spring semester of the first academic year in which they have met the above criteria. If awarded, faculty will be notified of promotion by the end of that spring semester in the academic year in which they apply, and promotion shall become effective at the start of the following academic year (July 1st).</span></p>\n<p>Among the considerations for promotion are the criteria for measuring excellence mentioned in Section <a href=\"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/6-evaluation-of-the-faculty#criteria\">C.6.a.</a>, as well as any further guidance established in each school. The principal determining factors for promotion for all faculty members, however, are excellence in teaching and validation of professional status, as determined by the individual school. Promotion to associate professor or professor requires evidence of significant contributions to the objectives of the Institute.</p>\n<p>All such criteria include the faculty member’s behavior as a responsible Institute citizen, including serving as a quality colleague to faculty members, quality mentor to students, and Institute community member who fosters its values and complies with its policies.  Early promotion may be considered in cases of exceptional merit.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"eval-process\" id=\"eval-process\"></a>C.6.h. The Process of Evaluation</strong></p>\n<p>Evaluation of faculty members for the purpose of contract renewal or promotion is a sequential process involving review by a committee of peers, the relevant dean (GSTILE, GSIPM, LPP), the Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC), the VPAA, the provost, and the president and Board of Trustees in the case of promotion to full professor. The faculty member has opportunities to respond at each stage of the process.  In cases of promotion, external reviews by qualified persons of adequate professional/academic standing are also required.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1 —</strong> To initiate the evaluation process for promotion or contract renewal, faculty members prepare and submit their professional files to their relevant deans according to the schedule set forth in Appendix A.</p>\n<p>A complete file shall contain, but is not limited to, the following items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the annual Faculty Activity Report (FAR) based on the criteria in Section <a href=\"#criteria\">C.6.a.</a>;</li>\n<li>evidence of teaching effectiveness (quantitative and qualitative student evaluations, and optionally course syllabi, sample assignments, student work, teaching philosophy statement);</li>\n<li>samples of publications;</li>\n<li>other evidence of professional currency and activity;</li>\n<li>community service, fundraising, etc.;</li>\n<li>letters of recommendation (optional).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is the individual faculty member’s responsibility to initiate the evaluation process by submitting a complete, well-organized file by the deadline specified in the evaluation schedule (<a href=\"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/appendix-a-faculty-evaluation-schedule\">Appendix A</a>). Should timely action not be taken by a faculty member, the relevant dean shall combine the relevant student course evaluation data and annual reviews into a rudimentary dossier, which is forwarded to the Peer Review Committee.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"step2\" id=\"step2\"></a>Step 2 –</strong> The process of forming the Peer Review Committees, including the role, if any, of the program chairs, shall be as agreed upon between the dean and the faculty of each school. Members of the committee shall be regular faculty members who, in the judgment of the dean, possess the professional expertise to evaluate the dossier. In the event that for good cause shown to the satisfaction of the VPAA, a candidate objects to a committee member’s participation, the VPAA shall direct that a replacement be appointed.</p>\n<p>The Peer Review Committee shall evaluate the faculty member’s record and present to the dean a written report, inclusive of its recommendation (contract renewal/non-renewal, promotion/non-promotion, or approval/non-approval of a sabbatical proposal).</p>\n<p>On the same date the Peer Review Committee recommendation is sent to the dean, a copy is forwarded to the faculty member, who has five (5) working days in which to submit a response to the committee’s evaluation and/or additional information to the relevant dean. This period may be extended if the faculty member is unavailable to receive and comment on the report.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2a</strong> – The soliciting of external reviews in cases of promotion review shall be the responsibility of the VPAA. To this end, the faculty member and the relevant dean shall both submit a list of names, including contact information, of three persons possessing adequate professional/academic expertise and qualifications to evaluate the dossier and to judge also on the basis of the mission of the program with which the candidate is affiliated. External reviewers should be established scholars in the candidate’s field, or leaders in the profession.  In order to guarantee sufficient time and to facilitate the process, the name lists must be submitted to the VPAA no later than October 1. The VPAA shall then obtain a written evaluation from one person on each list.</p>\n<p>The external reviewers shall confine their evaluation to the faculty member’s record of scholarship/professional achievement as well as professional stature and present to the VPAA a written report, inclusive of their recommendation (promotion/non-promotion).</p>\n<p>The external reviews shall be obtained in a period of time concurrent with the peer-review process. The faculty member will have access to the opinions of the external reviewers, but not to the external reviewers’ identities, thus preserving the confidentiality of the process. Restricting access is meant to ensure frank and honest assessments of the candidate, while still providing useful input into the faculty member’s formative evaluation.  The deans, FEC, and VPAA will have access to all materials submitted in connection with promotion review, including the external evaluations.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"step3\" id=\"step3\"></a>Step 3 —</strong> The relevant dean, whose review must explicitly acknowledge the candidate’s written response(s), if any, adds his/her evaluation of the faculty member to the file and forwards it to the <strong>Faculty Evaluation Committee</strong>. The dean’s final evaluation shall be issued no sooner than five (5) working days after receiving the peer evaluation and the external reviews in cases of promotion.</p>\n<p>On the same date, a copy of the dean’s evaluation is sent by the relevant dean directly to the faculty member, who has five (5) working days in which to submit, to the <strong>Faculty Evaluation Committee</strong>, a response to the dean’s evaluation. This period may be extended if the faculty member is unavailable to receive and comment on the report.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4 —</strong> The Faculty Evaluation Committee will review the file, explicitly acknowledging any written responses and othermaterials from the faculty member. The Committee may request additional information from any party involved in the case.If the Committee finds that the faculty member has not been accorded due process during the evaluation procedure, it shall forward such a finding to the VPAA, with copies forwarded to the relevant dean and to the faculty member on the same date. In doing so, the Committee shall consider whether in its judgment, the evaluation has proceeded in accordance with policies of the Faculty Handbook.</p>\n<p>Unless the Faculty Evaluation Committee finds that the faculty member has not been accorded due process during the prior evaluation procedure, it will then make its own independent evaluation. The Committee shall issue its final evaluation no sooner than five (5) working days after receiving the file from the <strong>dean.</strong> The Faculty Evaluation Committee’s independent evaluation may take one of three forms: (a) concurrence with the recommendations of the relevant dean; (b) non-concurrence with the recommendation of the relevant dean; or (c) a recommendation, for reasons stated, that the VPAA invoke the one-year extension provision (see section 6.10) or, under special circumstances, a longer extension to provide the faculty member sufficient time to demonstrate enhanced performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5</strong> — The Faculty Evaluation Committee places its finding of due process and its evaluation of the faculty member in the file, with copies forwarded to the faculty member, the relevant dean and the VPAAon the same date. The faculty member has five (5) working days in which to submit a response to the Committee’s evaluation and/or additional material to the VPAA.</p>\n<p>The VPAA, whose review must explicitly acknowledge any written response from the candidate submitted within five (5) days of the Faculty Evaluation Committee's decision, shall issue a final report including evaluation of the file and recommendation, no sooner than five (5) working days after receipt of the file. This report is added to the file, with copies forwarded to the faculty member <strong>and</strong> the relevant dean on the same date.</p>\n<p>In the case of renewal of a contract, the VPAA will make a recommendation to the provost.  The provost will make the decision about the contract renewal.</p>\n<p>In the case of promotion to full professor, the recommendation will be forwarded to the president, who, in consultation with the provost, will make a decision, with the final decision to be made by the Board of Trustees.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 6</strong> — In cases other than promotion to full professor, should the faculty member disagree with the decision of the provost, they may appeal the decision in writing to the president within five (5) working days of being notified of the decision. The decision of the president is final.</p>\n<p>A faculty member being evaluated may request an additional five (5) days in addition to the five (5) working days provided, for the purpose of obtaining materials deemed critical to the case.</p>\n<p><strong>C.6.i. Sabbatical Leaves</strong></p>\n<p>The Institute provides opportunities for professional development and research through faculty sabbatical leaves, subject to available financial resources and program requirements.</p>\n<p>After each six (6) year period of full-time (or full-time equivalent) teaching at the Institute, faculty members become eligible to apply for a sabbatical leave. [See Appendix C]  Application for sabbatical leave is made in the fall semester of the sixth year of full-time teaching (or full-time equivalent) and, if granted, leave commences in the seventh year.  Before applying for a subsequent sabbatical leave, faculty members must again complete a minimum of six (6) years of full-time (or full-time equivalent) teaching. <span></span> <span>If sabbatical is taken in the fall semester of an academic year only, the spring semester does not count as part of this next six (6) year increment of full-time teaching.  </span></p>\n<p><span>In the event that a faculty member is not able to take sabbatical when eligible, for reasons of institutional need or world events beyond their control, the academic administration shall have the right to allow the faculty member to be eligible for the next sabbatical as would have been originally scheduled (e.g. if a 7th year sabbatical is deferred to year 8, the administration may allow the individual to be eligible again within year 14, rather than waiting until year 15).</span></p>\n<p>Faculty members must make formal application for a sabbatical leave through their relevant deans, who forward requests to the Faculty Evaluation Committee. The VPAA takes action based on the recommendation of the Faculty Evaluation Committee <strong>and</strong> relevant dean, and on the needs of the Institute. Applications should be made before September 30 of the year preceding the academic year for which the leave is requested. The process for review of sabbatical proposals is the same as the process for review of applications for contract renewal or promotion, beginning with <a href=\"#step3\">step 3</a>.</p>\n<p>The principal criteria considered for the granting of sabbatical leave include: the nature and quality of the research or professional project proposed by the candidate for the period of the sabbatical; the utility of the project to the applicant's professional growth and to the reputation and academic programs at the Institute; and the ability of the Institute to continue its academic programs during the absence of the professor seeking a sabbatical. Faculty members who are granted sabbatical leaves normally are obligated to return to their regular teaching positions at the Institute for at least one (1) year following the sabbatical and to give a full report on their research or other activities during the sabbatical (for example in a poster fair, presentation, or colloquium).</p>\n<p>Schools may modify these criteria for sabbatical leaves to support the specific mission and objectives of the school. In that event, relevant deans, in consultation with their faculty and the VPAA, shall establish clear guidelines for framing such sabbatical leave criteria.</p>\n<p>Sabbatical leave may be granted for an entire academic year at fifty percent (50%) of the annual salary or for one (1) semester at full salary. The sabbatical period shall be counted as time served at the Institute for the purposes of calculating promotion and contract renewal periods. The Institute shall continue the faculty member's health and retirement benefits during the sabbatical under the same terms as during regular service at the Institute.</p>\n<p>In the event that a faculty member’s request for a sabbatical leave is denied by the relevant dean, the Faculty Evaluation Committee shall evaluate the request independently, based on the Institute criteria and any modifications made therein by the school, as described above.</p>\n<p><strong>C.6.j. Role of the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Institute (VPAA)</strong></p>\n<p>The VPAA of the Institute has approval/denial authority for all faculty sabbaticals, and recommends faculty contract renewals, promotions, and re-appointments of deans to the provost, subject in some cases to review by president or Board of Trustees, as outlined in the procedure above. The VPAA may elect to recommend an extension of an existing contract up to one (1) year, or, under special circumstances, a longer extension in those cases when it is judged that more time is needed to evaluate faculty performance for a contract renewal decision.</p>\n<p><strong>C.6.k. Leave without Pay</strong></p>\n<p>In its continuing efforts to provide its faculty with opportunities for professional research and development, the Institute shall consider options for academic leave without pay on a case-by-case basis. A faculty member may apply for leave without pay, normally before September 15 of the year preceding the academic year in which the leave is requested, by submitting formal written application to the VPAA through the relevant dean. Leave taken without pay shall not be considered time served at the Institute for purposes of calculating promotion and contract renewal periods, and benefits shall be suspended for the length of the leave. However, under extraordinary circumstances at the discretion of the VPAA, as long as the faculty member takes leave without pay for one year or less, the VPAA may allow the faculty member to count that leave as time served towards contract renewal, sabbatical, and/or promotion.</p>"},"f287f136-4519-51ce-80de-85a154e61629":{"id":"f287f136-4519-51ce-80de-85a154e61629","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/7-separation-from-the-institute","title":"C.7.

Grievance Procedure**\n\nA faculty member of the Institute should avail him/herself of the following grievance procedures for any violation of (a) his/her employment contract with the Institute; (b) the Faculty Handbook; or (c) other Institute policy that in his/her employment with the Institute, has materially damaged the faculty member.\n\nHowever, if a faculty member has a complaint of harassment, discrimination, or other behaviors noted in [Middlebury’s Anti-harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin), the complaint procedure in that policy should be used.\n\n**Filing a Grievance –** The grievance process begins with a written document transmitted by the faculty member to the VPAA that states:\n\n- the faculty member’s name, department, and appointment history;\n- the decisions by the Institute and the events that give rise to the grievance;\n- the adverse impact on the faculty member;\n- the part of his/her contract with the Institute, of the faculty handbook, of other policies, or of law, that have been violated, and in what manner there has been material  damage to the faculty member;\n- the resolution or remedy that is requested;\n- the names of the decision-makers and other persons with knowledge of the matters at issue;\n- what the faculty member has done to attempt to resolve the complaint.\n\n**Notification of Grievance  –** The VPAA shall notify the officer, agent, or representative of the Institute whose decision or actions are at issue. Where the decision or action at issue is by a committee of the Institute, the VPAA may choose to notify the committee.\n\n**Efforts to Resolve the Grievance –** The VPAA shall consult with the grieving faculty member and the officer, agent or representative of the Institute whose decision or actions are at issue, in an effort to identify if it is possible to resolve the grievance without a hearing. The VPAA has the power to propose a resolution of the grievance which shall conclude the grievance unless the grieving faculty member objects.\n\n**Faculty Grievance Review Committee  –** If the VPAA believes that the matter at issue is properly deemed to be a grievance as defined by this policy, the VPAA forms a faculty grievance review committee (FGRC), doing so in consultation with the relevant dean and the grieving faculty member. The VPAA appoints the chair and two other members to the FGRC; presents to the FGRC its charge; convenes the FGRC; and determines all procedural questions that are not resolved by this policy.\n\nThe VPAA solicits suggestions for committee members from the relevant dean and the grieving faculty member and appoints from the Institute faculty community at large, the chair and two other members of the FGRC. The grieving faculty member may petition the VPAA to excuse any member for good cause shown to the VPAA, such as prior knowledge of the grievance facts or demonstrated interest or bias toward or against any person involved in the matter.\n\n**Hearings** **–** The VPAA convenes and charges the FGRC within 30 days of the filing of the grievance, absent exigency or absence of key persons. The VPAA sets forth, in a charge letter, the procedures of hearing of the grievance and the date for hearing.\n\nThe hearing of the grievance shall include the taking of evidence submitted by the grieving faculty member and by any officer, agent or representative of the Institute whose decision or actions are at issue, or other evidence as requested by the chair.\n\nThe rules for evidence shall be informal such that all relevant information may be heard by the committee. A record of the hearing shall be kept by the chair, in the form of copies of exhibits and a tape recording of the testimonial evidence.\n\nThe hearing shall be closed to any person who is not a party to the grievance or a person called by the chair to give evidence. The chair shall regulate the presence of persons and the calling of persons to give evidence. Questioning of witnesses shall proceed informally except that any party to the grievance may request the chair to allow cross-questioning on important matters that do not intrude into personal privacy. Attorneys are not permitted at the hearings; however, a grieving faculty member may otherwise choose to have the advice of an attorney.\n\n**Determination of the Grievance** **–** Before the chair of the FGRC closes the hearing, the chair may request the submission of concluding statements by the parties and/or submission of a closing written statement. The chair shall thereafter convene the FGRC for confidential assessment of the matter and upon conclusion of the assessment meetings, the FGRC shall issue a determination report which shall be issued by majority vote of the FGRC. The FGRC shall endeavor to issue a determination report that answers the charge from the VPAA upon the weight of the persuasive evidence.\n\nThe report shall be transmitted to the VPAA, who shall in turn transmit it to the grieving faculty member, and such other persons at the Institute whom the VPAA determines should be informed.\n\nThe report and determination of FGRC shall constitute the final determination of the grievance by the Institute upon the passage of thirty (30) days after transmittal of its report to the VPAA, unless the VPAA by then issues a written statement indicating that she/he is considering the grievance or by then has issued her/his decision on the grievance.\n\nThe written decision of the VPAA shall be transmitted to the FGRC chair and members, the grieving faculty member, and such other persons at the Institute whom the VPAA determines should be informed. The written decision of the VPAA shall be the final decision of the Institute.\n\n**<a name=\"discipline\" id=\"discipline\"></a>C.8.g. Policy and Procedures for Discipline of Regular Faculty Members**\n\n**Policy –** <span>In order to protect the values of academic freedom, the integrity of teaching of students and of faculty research, and sound administration of the institution, the Middlebury Institute requires the adherence of all faculty members to high standards of professional conduct.  In the event that a significant deviation from these standards is believed to have occurred, a faculty member may be required to submit to disciplinary charges, which shall be determined according to the procedures set forth in this policy.</span>\n\n**Professional Misconduct – General –** Professional misconduct is that which occurs in the course of, arising from, or reasonably related to the faculty member's Institute position, duties, or responsibilities with the Institute, or demonstrably affecting, in a significantly adverse way, the effective performance of Institute functions.\n\nNote that misconduct charges against a Middlebury Institute faculty member that fall under the Middlebury-wide [Non-Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy) are handled in accordance with those policies.\n\n**Professional Misconduct-Specific  –** Professional misconduct addressed by this policy includes the following:\n\n- dishonest, illegal or unethical behavior in the faculty member's teaching, research or service duties;\n\n- preventing or obstructing Institute teaching, research, or service functions, or any other lawful function of the Institute;\n\n- neglect of Institute-related duties or responsibilities;\n\n- other professional misconduct of a serious nature, including but not limited to, intentionally inflicting physical harm or other serious harm on a member of the Institute community, knowingly violating an Institute policy regulating behavior of faculty members; and\n\n- attempting to, abetting, or inciting another to, engage in conduct which would violate the above-described forms of misconduct if engaged in by the faculty member.\n\n**Disciplinary Procedures – General –** Discipline for professional misconduct involves either severe sanction(s) or less than severe sanctions. Proposed discipline may not be imposed except in compliance with faculty disciplinary procedures. Discipline other than severe sanctions may be imposed by action of the VPAA.\n\n**Severe Sanctions – Defined –** Severe sanctions are: a temporary reduction in base salary; suspension from the Institute from all or part of duties without pay for a specified period; and/or termination of appointment for disciplinary reasons.\n\n**Faculty Disciplinary Procedures – Specific**\n\n(a) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Severe Sanctions</span>: In order to initiate procedures for discipline for professional misconduct involving severe sanction(s), the VPAA will prepare a written statement of charges, the proposed severe sanctions, and a brief summary of relevant facts. The VPAA will deliver such written statement to the faculty member, together with notice of opportunity to meet and confer with the VPAA to attempt to resolve the matter by agreement. In the event that the matter is not resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the VPAA and the faculty member within thirty (30) days of delivery of the written statement, these disciplinary hearing procedures may be invoked by the notice of the VPAA to the faculty member. Hearings and final determination of the charges will be determined by use of the procedures set forth in the [Faculty Grievance Policy](#grievance), supplemented and altered as follows:\n\nHearings: A hearing shall be held by a panel consisting of three members appointed by the VPAA from among the regular faculty.\n\nThe panel shall rule upon any suggestion that a member or members of the proposed panel should be excluded for cause. Replacements for excused members shall be chosen by the VPAA from among the regular faculty. The hearing panel shall choose its own chair.\n\nThe principal responsibilities of the hearing panel are to develop a record, to make findings based on the record, and to forward a recommendation to the VPAA.  Unless an extension is granted by the chair upon a showing of good cause, the hearing panel shall begin the hearing within 60 days of the referral of a matter.\n\nThe hearing panel shall not be bound by formal rules of evidence. The VPAA shall have the burden of proving the charge of misconduct. Both the faculty member and the VPAA shall be permitted to present evidence, to examine all evidence presented, to confront and question all witnesses, and to present arguments orally or in writing. The faculty member may act as his or her own representative or may utilize the assistance of another faculty member. The VPAA may designate an Institute employee or employees who will participate on behalf of the VPAA. Party representatives may not be currently working as attorneys. Proceedings shall be tape recorded. Absent the agreement of the parties, the hearing shall be open only to those directly involved in the proceedings.\n\nThe VPAA shall review and consider the panel’s report and make a recommendation to the provost as to whether or not the charges are sustained and if so, the discipline to be imposed.  The provost will make a decision and notify the faculty member, and the panel. Decisions of the provost may be appealed to the president. All disciplinary decisions involving severe sanctions are ultimately subject to Board of Trustees approval.\n\n(b) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Non-Severe Sanctions</span>:  In the case of proposed sanctions which are not severe, the VPAA will prepare a written statement of charges, the proposed sanctions, and a brief summary of relevant facts. In the event that matter is not resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the VPAA and the faculty member within thirty (30) days of delivery of the written statement, the VPAA may impose discipline which carries other than severe sanction.  The VPAA will thereafter notify the faculty member in writing of the imposition of discipline. The VPAA may likewise impose sanctions that are not severe, while proceedings for severe sanctions under (a) above are pending. Imposition of sanctions that are not severe may be appealed to the provost.<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"></span>\n","excerpt":"C.8.a.

Jury Duty and Subpoenaed Work-Related Court Appearances</strong></p>\n<p>The Institute recognizes jury duty as a civic obligation and shall excuse all summoned faculty members from work without loss of pay if jury duty is required. However, in most cases, courts agree to delay the jury duty requirement for teachers if that duty falls during an academic semester. Every effort should be made to obtain such a delay in order not to disrupt the academic process. However, should jury duty be required during the academic semester, the following procedure applies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upon presentation of a formal summons, a faculty member shall be excused from work for service as a juror.</li>\n<li>The faculty member shall consult with the relevant dean to find appropriate substitute(s) for any class time missed or to arrange for a make-up class or classes.</li>\n<li>The same procedures as outlined above shall be followed for faculty members who are served subpoenas for court appearances directly related to their work duties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>C.8.c.

Procedures to follow in case of illness or emergency</strong></p>\n<p>Any unexpected development preventing a faculty member from meeting a class should be reported to, and handled by, the appropriate relevant dean. When a class must be canceled, absent exceptional circumstances, the dean's assistant should be informed by the faculty member in time to post notice in the scheduled classroom.

Employment Policies and Practices","body":"\n**D.1.a. Introduction**\n\nThis handbook is designed to provide all employees with clear, concise, and accessible information about employment at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.\n\nThis document is intended solely to provide guidance on the mutual expectations shared by the Institute and its employees. All staff members are employed at will as defined by California Law. Neither this handbook nor any other personnel document or oral statement, including benefit plan descriptions, constitutes an employment contract or creates any type of contractual obligation or promise or representation of continued employment for any staff employee. Neither the employee nor the Institute is bound to continue the employment relationship if either, at any time, chooses to end it.\n\nThe Institute reserves the right to change, revise, or eliminate any of the policies described herein, except for the policy of at will employment for staff members. The only recognized deviations from stated policies are those that are in writing, authorized and signed by the president of the College.\n\nSome of the policies and provisions contained herein (such as holiday and CTO benefits) are not applicable to faculty. If you have any questions as to which policies are not applicable to faculty, please address them to the Human Resources Department. Additional policies and provisions that apply solely to the faculty are described in a Faculty Handbook section of the Institute Handbook.\n\nWhile the Employee Handbook provides much detail, it does not cover every permutation of every situation. Questions should be directed to the Human Resources Office at ext. 3520\\. The College President is the final and binding interpreter of the provisions of the Employee Handbook as they apply to the facts of a particular situation.\n\n**D.1.b. About the Institute**\n\nThe Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey is an academic community committed to preparing innovative professionals able to provide leadership in cross-cultural, multilingual environments. Founded in 1955 with a commitment to promoting international understanding through the study of language and culture, the Institute has graduated prominent leaders in foreign service and diplomacy, in language teaching, translation and interpretation, and in the international business and nonprofit communities.\n\nEffective June 30, 2010, the Institute merged with Middlebury College following an affiliation with the College that was established in 2005\\. One of the country’s leading liberal arts colleges, Middlebury is also home to the renowned Middlebury Language Schools, Schools Abroad in twelve countries, the Bread Loaf School of English, and the Bread Loaf Writer’s Conference. Affiliation with Middlebury has created a unique opportunity for both institutions to have an even greater impact in the realm of global education.\n\nAs a graduate school of Middlebury College, the Institute is governed by the Board of Trustees of Middlebury College, which has also established a Board of Overseers of the Institute to review and advise the Institute regarding its operations and to make recommendations to the Board of Trustees of the College.\n\nThe Institute is organized into two graduate schools that offer professional master’s degrees from its Monterey, California campus:\n\n• The Graduate School of International Policy and Management\n\n• The Graduate School of Translation, Interpretation, and Language Education\n\nThe Institute is also home to the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, the world’s largest nongovernmental organization devoted to curbing the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and to a number of non-degree programs including intensive and customized language learning opportunities.\n\n**D.1.c. Diversity**\n\nAt the Institute, our international focus reinforces our emphasis on diversity in our student body and in our faculty and staff. The Institute recognizes the importance of treating every member of the community with fairness and respect and encourages inter-cultural understanding in all our dealings with each other, just as we embed cross-cultural competence in all our academic programs.\n\n**D.1.d. Non-discrimination, Anti-Harassment and Related Policies**\n\nThe Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, as a Graduate School of Middlebury College, falls under the jurisdiction of Middlebury College policy with regard to compliance with any and all federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination.  Please see the Middlebury [Non-Discrimination Policies](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies), which include the Middlebury [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin),  and the [Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic and Dating Violence and Misconduct, and Stalking](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/smdvs).\n\n**D.1.e. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**\n\nThe Institute recognizes and supports the standards set forth in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California laws that are designed to eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The Institute does not discriminate against individuals with disabilities in any aspect of the employment relationship, and provides reasonable accommodations as required by law to otherwise qualified employees and applicants with disabilities except for undue hardship situations. Employment and educational opportunities or privileges will not be denied to an otherwise qualified employee or applicant because of the need for reasonable accommodation of the individual's disability. Discrimination based on an employee's or applicant's association with a disabled individual is also forbidden. Employees with disability-related concerns should contact the Human Resources Office to initiate the process of requesting an accommodation or to present a complaint of violation of this policy.\n\nThe Institute will make reasonable accommodations as required by law. Qualifying disabilities can include, for example, vision, hearing, or mobility impairments, psychological and medical conditions, and learning disabilities that limit one or more of an employee’s major life activities and may necessitate non-essential modifications to the facilities or the job, but which do not prevent the employee from effectively performing, with reasonable accommodations, the essential functions of the job.\n\n**D.1.f. Employment Eligibility**\n\nIt is the policy of the Institute to employ only United States citizens and aliens who are authorized to work in the United States. In complying with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, it is against Institute policy to discriminate because of an individual's national origin, citizenship, or intent to become a U.S. citizen. In accordance with federal law, each prospective employee shall be required to provide, within 72 hours of employment, documents verifying her/his identity and authorization to be legally employed in the United States. In addition, the prospective employee will be required to sign a verification attesting s/he is legally employable in the United States. The Institute shall retain copies of the documents submitted by the employee. To the extent practical and appropriate, these documents will be kept confidential. However, the Institute is required to provide copies of the documents to the U.S. Department of Labor and the Customs and Immigration Service (\"USCIS\", formerly “INS”) on request.\n\nProviding false documentation or making false statements on the verification shall be grounds for immediate termination. During the course of employment, if the Institute requests further information relating to the employee's authorization to work in the United States, the employee shall furnish the information requested. Failure to cooperate in furnishing such information shall be grounds for discipline, up to and including termination.\n\n**D.1.g. Affirmative Action**\n\nMiddlebury College and the Middlebury Institute maintain Affirmative Action Plans, and commit themselves to good faith and lawful efforts to correct any under-representation or under-utilization that has been identified by the Institute as warranting such action. The Manager of Human Resources has been designated the Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Officer for the Institute. Inquiries concerning the application of federal and state laws and regulations should be referred to the Human Resources Office.\n\n**D.1.h. Identification Cards**\n\nAll employees are expected to obtain an Institute photo identification card within the first week of employment. After submitting the required employment paperwork to the Human Resources Office, new employees may make arrangements to obtain identification cards by contacting Security at x4153\\. Identification cards are property of the Institute and must be relinquished at the conclusion of employment.\n\n**D.1.i. Background Screenings**\n\nThe Institute requires that all newly hired employees have a background screening, and in some cases a credit check, performed by a third party specialist organization.\n\nCredit checks are conducted for positions in the Business Office, the Institutional Advancement Office and other positions with fiduciary duties or responsibilities, or with significant access to related information.\n\nAny offer of employment made prior to the completion of the background check is conditional, contingent upon receipt of information satisfactory to the Institute.\n\nAll pre-employment background screenings are conducted by a third party to ensure privacy. Screenings are conducted in conformity with the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and state and federal anti-discrimination and privacy laws. All screening reports are maintained separately from employee personnel files. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), all background screenings are done only after a person has received a disclosure and has signed a release.\n\nAn individual who has previously been employed at the Institute and is returning to work after being absent for more than one year will be required to undergo a background screening.\n\nAn employee who transfers or is promoted to a position that has fiduciary responsibilities will be required to consent to a background screening.\n\nThese screenings will only be performed with the candidate’s permission and only if the Institute intends to offer a candidate employment. If a candidate declines to give permission to conduct these screenings, s/he will not be eligible for employment at the Institute.\n\n**D.1.j. New Employee Orientation**\n\nOrientation sessions are hosted by Human Resources and are designed to introduce new staff members to the history, culture, and mission of the Institute, as well as allow them to complete required employment paperwork. The orientation program provides employees with the opportunity to meet different members of the community, become acquainted with the campus, review Institute policies, and enroll in eligible benefit programs.\n\nEach newly hired regular staff employee receives a job description and a letter of appointment summarizing the terms of employment, compensation rate, number of work hours per week, payment schedule, whether the employee is overtime exempt, whether the employee is eligible for benefits, and the name of the employee’s supervisor.\n\nNew employees also receive orientation within their departments, covering safety procedures for the particular location and other matters pertinent to the position.\n\n**D.1.k. Introductory Period for New Employees**\n\nAll new or rehired employees work on a provisional basis for the first three months. Employees are encouraged to take advantage of this period to determine whether the position meets their expectations and to get clarification concerning responsibilities. The Institute will use this period to evaluate an employee's capabilities and work habits. Either the Institute or the employee may end the employment relationship at will, with or without cause, during the introductory period or thereafter.\n\nProvisional employment status does not affect eligibility for employer-provided benefits.\n\nA newly hired employee will receive a performance appraisal at the completion of the provisional period. Subsequent reviews occur annually on a schedule published by the Human Resources Office.\n\n**D.1.l. Personnel Records**\n\nDisclosure of personnel files is restricted to authorized persons within the Institute. Any request regarding personnel files should be directed to Human Resources staff, who are the only people authorized to release information about current or former employees. Disclosure of confidential personnel information to outside sources is limited. The Institute generally will release personnel information to third parties if the employee has given her/his written authorization or if release of the records is needed to protect or advance the Institute's business interests or otherwise is lawful. The Institute will provide information as requested by authorized law enforcement or local, state, or federal agencies conducting official investigations and as otherwise legally required.\n\nEmployees are responsible for ensuring that their names, addresses and information about dependents or marital status are kept up to date in their personnel files. To ensure continuity of benefits, Human Resources should be informed immediately of any such changes. The Institute is required by law to maintain current employee records and for official purposes can rely only on existing records; the Institute is not responsible for accommodating any status change not communicated in writing (including via email) to the Human Resources Office.\n\nPersonal directory information about Institute employees (home address, phone number) is maintained for the purpose of facilitating essential communication and is disseminated only to those members of the Institute administration who have a need to know.\n\n**D.1.m. Personnel File Access Policy**\n\nEmployees have the legal right to inspect certain documents in their personnel files. Such inspections must occur in the presence of a Human Resources representative at a mutually convenient time.\n\nEmployees may inspect or receive a copy of the personnel records that the Institute maintains relating to your performance or to any grievance concerning you. Certain documents may be excluded or redacted from your personnel file by law, and there are legal limitations on the number of requests that can be made.\n\nAny request to inspect or copy personnel records must be made in writing to the Human Resources Manager. You may designate a representative to conduct the inspection of the record or receive a copy of the records. However, any designated representative must be authorized by you in writing to inspect or receive a copy of the records. The Institute may take reasonable steps to verify the identity of any representative you have designated in writing to inspect or receive a copy of your personnel records.\n\nThe personnel records may be made available to you either at 437 Pierce Street, Monterey, CA or at a mutually agreeable location (with no loss of compensation for going to that location to inspect or copy the records). The records will be made available no later than 30 calendar days from the date the Institute receives your written request to inspect or copy your personnel records (unless you/your representative and the Institute mutually agree in writing to a date beyond 30 calendar days but no later than 35 calendar days from receipt of the written request).\n\nDisclosure of personnel information to outside sources, other than your designated representative, will be limited. However, the Institute will cooperate with requests from authorized law enforcement or local, state, or federal agencies conducting official investigations and as otherwise legally required.\n\n**D.1.n. Reporting Time & Payroll Issues**\n\nAll employees of the Institute are paid every other Friday on a bi-weekly pay period basis. If a payday falls on a holiday, employees will receive paychecks on the last working day of the week. The pay period begins on Monday and ends on the following second Sunday. The pay calendar can be downloaded from the [Employee Resources](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/offices-services/human-resources/employee-resources) section of the Institute’s website.\n\nHourly and salaried staff are required to use the [BannerWeb](https://ssb-prod.ec.middlebury.edu/PNTR/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin) system to record hours worked and leave taken during each pay period. All time must be submitted by 3:00 PM on the Friday prior to the close of the pay period in order to be included in the next paycheck. Failure to submit time by the prescribed deadline may result in disciplinary action. Time reporting procedures for exempt staff are not for the purposes of evaluating the amount or quality of work performed nor for pay purposes, and do not alter the fact that exempt staff are not paid based on the number of hours worked.\n\nIf you feel your check may be inaccurate, first verify that your time was submitted accurately and on time. Issues regarding rate of pay, positions or titles and time off should be directed to Human Resources. Other paycheck issues, such as those involving taxes, should be directed to the Payroll department.\n\n**D.1.o. Employment Status**\n\nThe Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey maintains the following staff employment status definitions. These definitions are used primarily to determine eligibility for benefits. The primary basis for determining employment status is committed hours, defined as regularly scheduled and budgeted hours assigned to a specific position. Regardless of the number of hours actually worked, on-call positions have no committed hours. Human Resources will work collaboratively with managers to determine the classification of each position.\n\n**_Regular staff employees_** work on a regular schedule for an unspecified duration and are normally employed for a position as a result of open recruitment. Regular employees may be classified as full-time; part-time benefit eligible; part-time non-benefit eligible.\n\nIf a regular staff employee is classified as exempt, the employee is not paid based on the number of hours worked. If a regular staff employee is classified as non-exempt, the employee is paid based on the number of hours worked AND AN HOURLY RATE OF PAY.\n\n**_Full-time staff employees_** are normally scheduled to work 37.5 hours per week. To be classified as full-time for purposes of benefits, an employee must be scheduled to work at least 32 hours per week (1664 hours per year). Full-time staff employees are benefits eligible.\n\n**_Part-time, benefit eligible staff employees_** are scheduled to work at least 20 but less than 32 hours per week (between 1000 and 1663 hours per year).\n\n**_Part-time, non-benefit eligible staff employees_** are scheduled to work less than 20 hours per week, or less than 1000 hours per year.\n\n**_Time-limited employees_** are employed for an assignment of a “not to exceed” specific duration. A time-limited employee is eligible for benefits if the committed hours for his/her position totals 1000 hours in the 12 months following his/her appointment. Postgraduate Fellows are included in this category. Time-limited assignments may be extended; however, the employment status of an employee who works longer than the period originally expected and designated will not automatically change.\n\n**_On-call staff employees_** work as needed on an hourly basis. Hours may vary from part-time to full-time. There are no committed hours attached to these positions. On-call staff are not eligible for benefits.\n\nStaff positions funded from external sources will be classified into the appropriate job status as determined by job assignment and the duration of time that the position is not to exceed.\n\nAll staff employment, regardless of employment status definition, is at-will, at the mutual consent of the employee and the Institute. (See At-Will Employment, below.)\n\nPart-time and time-limited employees may be ineligible for Institute Benefits. To determine eligibility for specific benefits consult the sections of this handbook addressing those benefits or, if applicable, the Summary Plan Descriptions.\n\nIndependent contractors and consultants are not employees of the Institute and are not entitled to employee benefits. Terms and conditions of their services are set forth in an agreement entered into between the Institute and the contractor.\n\nIf you have any doubt about your status as described above, contact the Manager of Human Resources.\n\nThe Institute reserves the right, at any time, to alter or change job responsibilities, reassign or transfer job positions, or assign additional job responsibilities. From time to time, employees may be asked to work on special projects or to perform other work necessary or important to the operation of the department or the Institute. Cooperation and assistance in performing such additional work is expected.\n\n**D.1.p. At-Will Employment**\n\nThe administration of The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey hopes that every staff employee will find the employment relationship with the Institute satisfying and rewarding in all respects. At the same time, it recognizes that employment relationships are not always mutually satisfactory. To protect the rights of both staff employee and the Institute, employees should remember that employment is at the mutual consent of the employee and the Institute. As defined by the [California Labor Code](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&division=3.&title=&part=&chapter=2.&article=4.), either the at-will employee or the Institute can terminate the employment relationship, at any time, with or without cause, and with or without advance notice. Staff members who work in positions with a pre-scheduled not to exceed end date, whether funded by grant or contract monies or otherwise known as a “fixed term” position are in at-will status during that time and subject to conclusion of employment at or before the scheduled end date.\n\n**D.1.q. Work Schedule**\n\nThe Institute normally is open for business between the hours of 8:30 AM and 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday. Some departments, such as the library, are open extended hours. Supervisors are responsible for assigning individual work schedules. Employees are expected to be at their desks or work stations at the start of their scheduled hours, ready to perform their work. The workday (a consecutive 24-hour period) begins at 12:01 AM and ends at midnight. The workweek begins on Monday and ends on Sunday.\n\n**D.1.r. Telecommuting**\n\nThe Institute places a high value on community and quality of service to its students. Generally, this means that faculty and staff need to perform their work on campus with their students and colleagues.  We do recognize, however, that there may be circumstances in which an employee is unable to be present on campus, but could work effectively from another location.  An employee who would like to explore this possibility should first speak with his/her supervisor, who will ascertain whether or not telecommuting is feasible, and if so, work with HR to develop a telecommuting agreement that ensures compliance with relevant state and federal regulations.\n\n**D.1.s. Exempt/Non-Exempt Status**\n\nUnder state and federal laws regarding overtime pay, the Institute’s executive, administrative and support staff members are classified either overtime exempt or non-exempt. Exempt employees are paid a salary that covers all work and do not receive additional compensation for hours worked beyond their normal workweek. Determination of exempt or non-exempt status is made by Human Resources, based on the employee’s job description, state and federal law, and guidelines issued by the California Industrial Welfare Commission and U.S. Department of Labor.\n\n**D.1.t. Compensatory Time Off**\n\nEmployees who are non-exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act or the California Labor Code are not granted compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay. All hours worked in excess of the employee’s normal workweek will be compensated as extra pay and should be recorded and submitted in the current pay period.\n\nExempt employees are paid a fixed salary intended to provide all of the compensation to which they are entitled. They are not entitled to additional compensation for extra hours of work or time off in lieu of additional compensation. Neither extra compensation nor compensatory time off will be owed or payable to an exempt employee upon separation from the Institute for any reason.\n\n**D.1.u. Meal and Rest Periods**\n\nNon-exempt employees working shifts lasting five hours or longer are entitled to a one-hour, unpaid meal period taken approximately in the middle of the work shift. Non-exempt employees working more than six-hour shifts may not “skip” the meal period to shorten the workday. If an employee is not provided a meal break, they will be paid one additional hour of pay at their regular pay rate. They are allowed paid ten-minute rest periods for every four hours of work or major portion thereof. Rest periods should be taken approximately halfway through the four-hour period. Rest periods cannot be combined or saved to create extended meal breaks, leave early, or arrive late. When necessary, supervisors are responsible for scheduling meal and rest periods.\n\n**D.1.v. Voting (time off)**\n\nIn accordance with California Elections Code section 14000, employees who do not have sufficient time outside of working hours to vote at a statewide election may take off enough working time that — when added to the voting time available outside of working hours — will enable them to vote. The Institute will provide the employee up to two hours of time off with pay to vote. The time off for voting will be only at the beginning or end of the regular work shift, whichever allows the most free time for voting and the least time off from the regular working shifts, unless otherwise mutually agreed.\n\nIf by the third working day prior to the day of election employees know, or have reason to believe, that time off will be necessary to be able to vote on election day, they must give their supervisor at least two working days' notice that time off for voting is desired, in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n**D.1.w. Call-In Pay (Reporting-Time Pay)**\n\nIn accordance with the State of California's Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Order 4-2001, the Institute will pay a minimum of two hours pay to non-exempt employees who are required to report to work on a day other than their normally scheduled workday. In addition, the Institute will pay non-exempt employees for half of the regularly scheduled workday if employees report to work as instructed and there is not work available, except if the interruption of work is because of the failure of any or all public utilities, or because of an act of God or other cause not within the Institute's power to control.\n\n**D.1.x. Garnishment of Wages**\n\nThe Institute is obligated to comply with all wage garnishment orders. Questions regarding wage garnishment should be directed to Human Resources.\n\n**D.1.y. Overtime**\n\nEmployees occasionally may be required to work extra hours. Exempt employees may be expected to work beyond their normal schedules, as their job responsibilities require, and do so without additional pay beyond their regular salary. Non-exempt employees receive additional compensation at the rate of time and one-half, for hours worked in addition to 8 hours per workday and/or 40 hours per workweek, up to 12 hours worked and thereafter at double time. For purposes of determining which hours constitute additional time, only actual hours worked in a given work week will be counted;  sick leave taken, jury duty leave, or call-in/reporting time payment do not count towards hours worked. Failure to obtain one’s supervisor’s approval before working overtime may result in disciplinary action.\n\nA workday begins at 12:01 AM and ends 24 hours later. A workweek begins each Monday at 12:01 AM.\n\nAll regular time and overtime hours must be accurately recorded on the non-exempt employee's timesheet and approved by the supervisor prior to payment. Tampering, altering, or falsifying time records will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n\n**D.1.z. Travel Pay**\n\nExempt employees are not paid on the basis of hours worked, and there is therefore no additional pay or compensatory time for time spent traveling.\n\nEmployees are reimbursed for all out-of-pocket travel expenses allowable under the Institute’s travel guidelines.\n\nFor non-exempt employees, travel time (defined as time spent actively traveling between the normal work site and another location where work will be done) is considered work time and should be recorded as such on the time sheet.\n\nCommuting time to and from the normal work place is not considered work time and is not compensated. If the employee departs from or returns to his/her home for work-related travel without first going to the normal work location, he/she should deduct the normal commute time from the travel time.\n\nIf the total number of hours worked (including travel) exceeds 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a week, the employee is entitled to overtime pay calculated in accordance with the Institute's normal overtime policy.\n\nTime spent during the course of travel on sleeping, eating meals, and other personal activities is not considered work time and is not compensated.\n\n**D.1.aa. Pay Advances**\n\nThe Institute does not provide pay advances.\n\n**D.1.bb. Direct Deposits**\n\nEmployees are eligible for automatic payroll deposit. They may initiate automatic deposit through the online [Banner](https://ssb-prod.ec.middlebury.edu/PNTR/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin) system. Automatic deposit can be started or stopped at any time.\n\n**D.1.cc. Payroll Records**\n\nEmployees may access their payroll records through the online [Banner](https://ssb-prod.ec.middlebury.edu/PNTR/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin) system.\n\n**D.1.dd. Performance Evaluations**\n\nEach staff employee is scheduled to receive periodic performance reviews.\n\nThe first review takes place after the initial three months of employment. Employees who transfer to another position within the Institute are reviewed with respect to their original job at the time of transfer, and within three months of assuming the new position. HR will notify the new supervisor when the three month review is due. Subsequent evaluations are normally conducted annually. The employee and the supervisor each complete a written evaluation of the employee’s job performance. They then share their evaluations with each other, and these documents form the basis for a discussion of the employee’s performance and professional development needs. The employee signs the evaluation to indicate that s/he has discussed it with her/his supervisor and is aware of its contents. The signed evaluation is placed in the employee’s personnel file.\n\nEmployees have the right to submit written responses to their evaluations, which will be added to their personnel files. Employee responses should be submitted within five working days of receiving their performance review.\n\nPerformance evaluations are intended to help employees recognize their progress, become aware of areas for improvement, and set objectives or goals for future work performance. Positive performance evaluations do not guarantee increases in salary, promotions, or continued employment. Salary increases and promotions are solely at the discretion of the Institute and depend upon many factors in addition to performance.\n\nWhile professional development goals are an expected component of performance evaluations in general, a specific, written performance improvement plan is mandated if an employee receives an unacceptable overall rating on a performance evaluation, if the employee’s employment in that position is to continue thereafter.\n\n**D.1.ee. Progressive Discipline**\n\nThe Institute may choose in appropriate situations to utilize a progressive discipline system to serve as a fair and consistent means to enforce Institute rules and regulations and to address conduct or performance deficiencies. The purpose of progressive discipline is to retain employees through identification and correction of certain types of problems. Failure to correct such problems may lead to suspension or termination, and serious infractions may result in immediate termination. The Institute reserves the right to terminate the at-will employment of any employee at any time, with or without cause or notice; thus, progressive discipline is applicable or not, at the discretion of the Institute, for those situations deemed appropriate by the Institute.\n\nIf a situation, at the discretion of the Institute, warrants progressive discipline, the disciplinary actions applied may include a verbal warning, a written warning, a written reprimand, and/or termination from employment. Every action need not be taken in each case, and depending upon the relevant circumstances, the Institute may decide to take any disciplinary action, including immediate termination, at any time. Relevant circumstances that affect the course of disciplinary action may include the Institute’s judgment as to the seriousness or severity of the individual employee's deficiencies in performance and/or conduct, prior performance and conduct, and management's assessment of appropriate factors identified during the investigation. Examples of some of the circumstances that in the Institute’s judgment might lead to summary discharge include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Conduct that is in opposition to the Institute's nondiscrimination or harassment policies;\n- Sustained insubordination or refusal to comply with a reasonable request given by the supervisor or Institute official, or abusive treatment of a supervisor or Institute official;\n- Theft of Institute property, personal property, or theft of service;\n- Falsification of records, time cards, or claiming sickness under false pretenses;\n- Disorderly conduct while on the job;\n- Deliberate, frequent, and/or recurring violations of stated safety regulations, even if they are not intentional;\n- Unexcused absence without notice for three days;\n- Use or possession of, or being under the influence of illegal substances or alcohol while at work;\n- Threatening physical harm, or actual physical violence to another member of the Institute community;\n- Breach of confidentiality, which is defined as releasing to unauthorized persons, or misuse of confidential information to which an employee is privy because of her/his job.\n\n**D.1.ff. Promotions and Transfers**\n\nEmployees are encouraged to apply for promotions to positions for which they are qualified. Promotions and transfer decisions are based on the hiring supervisor’s and/or his/her supervisor’s judgment of ability, qualifications, and potential for the position. Some promotions or transfers may be offered without open recruitment.\n\n**D.1.gg. Employment: Internal Career Opportunities**\n\nAll vacant positions are posted on the Institute web site for a minimum of 5 business days and internal candidates have an opportunity to apply unless in a special circumstance a waiver of posting is granted by the president of the College.\n\nNormally, an employee must have been in her/his current position for a minimum of 3 months before being eligible to apply for positions in other departments. If an employee is selected to interview for a position, and is a final candidate, the employee should inform her/his current supervisor of her/his interest in the new position. If an employee is offered and accepts a position external to her/his current department, coordination between both departments, facilitated by Human Resources, may be required to ensure that the timing of such a transfer does not result in a hardship to the Institute. Normally, the transferring employee will assume her/his new duties two weeks after being selected for the new position.\n\n**D.1.hh. Voluntary Termination of Employment/Resignation**\n\nResignation is defined as employment termination initiated by an employee who chooses to leave the Institute. An employee who is considering leaving the Institute for any reason is encouraged to discuss her/his situation with her/his immediate supervisor before making a final decision.\n\nIf the employee chooses to leave the Institute, it is expected that as much notice as possible will be given in order to give the Institute the opportunity to plan for a smooth transition. At least two working weeks' notice is customary for non-exempt (hourly paid) employees while administrative and professional staff (salaried) are asked to give at least one month’s notice. A letter of resignation addressed to the department head, stating the final date(s) of employment, will be forwarded to Human Resources. Before leaving, the employee must visit the Human Resources Office to make benefit transition arrangements, to return all Institute property, and to have an exit interview with Human Resources.\n\nAn employee who fails to report to work for three consecutively scheduled workdays without notice to, and approval by, her/his supervisor (or the Manager of Human Resources if the supervisor is not available) will be considered to have abandoned her/his job and will be considered to have resigned unless, in the sole judgment of the Institute, a true and reasonable excuse is thereafter offered and accepted by the Institute.\n\nCTO time may not be taken in lieu of working the last two weeks of employment. The termination date is the actual last day of work. All unused accrued CTO hours will be paid on the employee’s last day of work.\n\nAll Institute-owned property (vehicles, keys, identification cards, parking permit, credit cards, laptop computers, uniforms, etc.) must be returned immediately upon termination of employment in order to receive final payments.\n\n**D.1.ii. Institute Re-employment**\n\nConsideration for re-employment is based on qualifications and demonstrated ability, as well as prior job performance and fitness for Institute employment. An employee who was terminated by the Institute in a manner such that the employee left not in good standing may not be re-employed.\n\n**D.1.jj. Emeritus Status**\n\nEmeritus status may be granted to retiring staff as a special recognition for exemplary work performance and outstanding, loyal, and dedicated service to the Institute. To be eligible for consideration for Emeritus status, an employee must be in retirement status from the Institute, have at least ten years of service in a full-time regular position, be nominated by the senior administrator of her/his department, and have the approval of the VPAA.\n\n**D.1.kk. Retirement**\n\nThere is no mandatory retirement age for Institute employees; they may continue working without regard to age, subject to provisions concerning at-will and other termination of employment. Continuing employees nearing age 65 should contact Human Resources regarding Medicare coverage and certain decisions that must be made about health insurance coverage at age 65.\n\nAn employee planning to retire should consult Human Resources six months prior to her/his expected retirement date.\n\nRetirement plan participants should initiate procedures for receipt of retirement income benefits by writing directly to the retirement plan office. Payment of benefits to any continuing employee who participates in a retirement plan is subject to terms established by that plan.\n\nAlthough the Institute has no retirement age, work restrictions may be imposed under TIAA-CREF. Employees should refer to the TIAA-CREF summary plan description for details.\n\n**D.1.ll. Reductions in Force**\n\nUnder some circumstances, the Institute may restructure or reduce its workforce. If so, the Institute will make a reasonable effort to inform affected employees in advance. Employees to be laid off will be told the expected duration of the layoff if known. In determining which employees will be laid off, the Institute will identify the positions to be reduced and in selecting for retention among staff members performing in the same position to be reduced, will consider its operating requirements and other factors, including employees’ skills, productivity, ability, past performance, and, where other factors are equal in its judgment, their length of service.\n\n**D.1.mm. Exit Interview**\n\nEmployees ending employment at the Institute, whether voluntarily or involuntarily are strongly encouraged to meet with Human Resources staff for an exit interview. This interview will normally occur on or before the employee’s final workday. During the interview, the Manager of Human Resources or designee may ask for information about working conditions and the employee’s relationship with her/his supervisor and fellow staff members and will discuss employment benefits conversion. The employee also will have the opportunity to suggest ways to improve Institute operations. It is the employee’s responsibility to return all Institute property (vehicles, keys, identification cards, parking permit, credit cards, laptop computers, uniforms, etc.) by her/his final day of employment.\n","excerpt":"D.1.a.

About the Institute</strong></p>\n<p>The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey is an academic community committed to preparing innovative professionals able to provide leadership in cross-cultural, multilingual environments. Founded in 1955 with a commitment to promoting international understanding through the study of language and culture, the Institute has graduated prominent leaders in foreign service and diplomacy, in language teaching, translation and interpretation, and in the international business and nonprofit communities.</p>\n<p>Effective June 30, 2010, the Institute merged with Middlebury College following an affiliation with the College that was established in 2005. One of the country’s leading liberal arts colleges, Middlebury is also home to the renowned Middlebury Language Schools, Schools Abroad in twelve countries, the Bread Loaf School of English, and the Bread Loaf Writer’s Conference. Affiliation with Middlebury has created a unique opportunity for both institutions to have an even greater impact in the realm of global education.</p>\n<p>As a graduate school of Middlebury College, the Institute is governed by the Board of Trustees of Middlebury College, which has also established a Board of Overseers of the Institute to review and advise the Institute regarding its operations and to make recommendations to the Board of Trustees of the College.</p>\n<p>The Institute is organized into two graduate schools that offer professional master’s degrees from its Monterey, California campus:</p>\n<p>• The Graduate School of International Policy and Management</p>\n<p>• The Graduate School of Translation, Interpretation, and Language Education</p>\n<p>The Institute is also home to the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, the world’s largest nongovernmental organization devoted to curbing the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and to a number of non-degree programs including intensive and customized language learning opportunities.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.c. Diversity</strong></p>\n<p>At the Institute, our international focus reinforces our emphasis on diversity in our student body and in our faculty and staff. The Institute recognizes the importance of treating every member of the community with fairness and respect and encourages inter-cultural understanding in all our dealings with each other, just as we embed cross-cultural competence in all our academic programs.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.d. Non-discrimination, Anti-Harassment and Related Policies</strong></p>\n<p>The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, as a Graduate School of Middlebury College, falls under the jurisdiction of Middlebury College policy with regard to compliance with any and all federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination.  Please see the Middlebury <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies\">Non-Discrimination Policies</a>, which include the Middlebury <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin\">Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy</a>,  and the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/smdvs\">Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic and Dating Violence and Misconduct, and Stalking</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.e. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</strong></p>\n<p>The Institute recognizes and supports the standards set forth in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California laws that are designed to eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The Institute does not discriminate against individuals with disabilities in any aspect of the employment relationship, and provides reasonable accommodations as required by law to otherwise qualified employees and applicants with disabilities except for undue hardship situations. Employment and educational opportunities or privileges will not be denied to an otherwise qualified employee or applicant because of the need for reasonable accommodation of the individual's disability. Discrimination based on an employee's or applicant's association with a disabled individual is also forbidden. Employees with disability-related concerns should contact the Human Resources Office to initiate the process of requesting an accommodation or to present a complaint of violation of this policy.</p>\n<p>The Institute will make reasonable accommodations as required by law. Qualifying disabilities can include, for example, vision, hearing, or mobility impairments, psychological and medical conditions, and learning disabilities that limit one or more of an employee’s major life activities and may necessitate non-essential modifications to the facilities or the job, but which do not prevent the employee from effectively performing, with reasonable accommodations, the essential functions of the job.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.f. Employment Eligibility</strong></p>\n<p>It is the policy of the Institute to employ only United States citizens and aliens who are authorized to work in the United States. In complying with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, it is against Institute policy to discriminate because of an individual's national origin, citizenship, or intent to become a U.S. citizen. In accordance with federal law, each prospective employee shall be required to provide, within 72 hours of employment, documents verifying her/his identity and authorization to be legally employed in the United States. In addition, the prospective employee will be required to sign a verification attesting s/he is legally employable in the United States. The Institute shall retain copies of the documents submitted by the employee. To the extent practical and appropriate, these documents will be kept confidential. However, the Institute is required to provide copies of the documents to the U.S. Department of Labor and the Customs and Immigration Service (\"USCIS\", formerly “INS”) on request.</p>\n<p>Providing false documentation or making false statements on the verification shall be grounds for immediate termination. During the course of employment, if the Institute requests further information relating to the employee's authorization to work in the United States, the employee shall furnish the information requested. Failure to cooperate in furnishing such information shall be grounds for discipline, up to and including termination.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.g. Affirmative Action</strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury College and the Middlebury Institute maintain Affirmative Action Plans, and commit themselves to good faith and lawful efforts to correct any under-representation or under-utilization that has been identified by the Institute as warranting such action. The Manager of Human Resources has been designated the Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Officer for the Institute. Inquiries concerning the application of federal and state laws and regulations should be referred to the Human Resources Office.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.h. Identification Cards</strong></p>\n<p>All employees are expected to obtain an Institute photo identification card within the first week of employment. After submitting the required employment paperwork to the Human Resources Office, new employees may make arrangements to obtain identification cards by contacting Security at x4153. Identification cards are property of the Institute and must be relinquished at the conclusion of employment.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.i. Background Screenings</strong></p>\n<p>The Institute requires that all newly hired employees have a background screening, and in some cases a credit check, performed by a third party specialist organization.</p>\n<p>Credit checks are conducted for positions in the Business Office, the Institutional Advancement Office and other positions with fiduciary duties or responsibilities, or with significant access to related information.</p>\n<p>Any offer of employment made prior to the completion of the background check is conditional, contingent upon receipt of information satisfactory to the Institute.</p>\n<p>All pre-employment background screenings are conducted by a third party to ensure privacy. Screenings are conducted in conformity with the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and state and federal anti-discrimination and privacy laws. All screening reports are maintained separately from employee personnel files. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), all background screenings are done only after a person has received a disclosure and has signed a release.</p>\n<p>An individual who has previously been employed at the Institute and is returning to work after being absent for more than one year will be required to undergo a background screening.</p>\n<p>An employee who transfers or is promoted to a position that has fiduciary responsibilities will be required to consent to a background screening.</p>\n<p>These screenings will only be performed with the candidate’s permission and only if the Institute intends to offer a candidate employment. If a candidate declines to give permission to conduct these screenings, s/he will not be eligible for employment at the Institute.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.j. New Employee Orientation</strong></p>\n<p>Orientation sessions are hosted by Human Resources and are designed to introduce new staff members to the history, culture, and mission of the Institute, as well as allow them to complete required employment paperwork. The orientation program provides employees with the opportunity to meet different members of the community, become acquainted with the campus, review Institute policies, and enroll in eligible benefit programs.</p>\n<p>Each newly hired regular staff employee receives a job description and a letter of appointment summarizing the terms of employment, compensation rate, number of work hours per week, payment schedule, whether the employee is overtime exempt, whether the employee is eligible for benefits, and the name of the employee’s supervisor.</p>\n<p>New employees also receive orientation within their departments, covering safety procedures for the particular location and other matters pertinent to the position.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.k. Introductory Period for New Employees</strong></p>\n<p>All new or rehired employees work on a provisional basis for the first three months. Employees are encouraged to take advantage of this period to determine whether the position meets their expectations and to get clarification concerning responsibilities. The Institute will use this period to evaluate an employee's capabilities and work habits. Either the Institute or the employee may end the employment relationship at will, with or without cause, during the introductory period or thereafter.</p>\n<p>Provisional employment status does not affect eligibility for employer-provided benefits.</p>\n<p>A newly hired employee will receive a performance appraisal at the completion of the provisional period. Subsequent reviews occur annually on a schedule published by the Human Resources Office.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.l. Personnel Records</strong></p>\n<p>Disclosure of personnel files is restricted to authorized persons within the Institute. Any request regarding personnel files should be directed to Human Resources staff, who are the only people authorized to release information about current or former employees. Disclosure of confidential personnel information to outside sources is limited. The Institute generally will release personnel information to third parties if the employee has given her/his written authorization or if release of the records is needed to protect or advance the Institute's business interests or otherwise is lawful. The Institute will provide information as requested by authorized law enforcement or local, state, or federal agencies conducting official investigations and as otherwise legally required.</p>\n<p>Employees are responsible for ensuring that their names, addresses and information about dependents or marital status are kept up to date in their personnel files. To ensure continuity of benefits, Human Resources should be informed immediately of any such changes. The Institute is required by law to maintain current employee records and for official purposes can rely only on existing records; the Institute is not responsible for accommodating any status change not communicated in writing (including via email) to the Human Resources Office.</p>\n<p>Personal directory information about Institute employees (home address, phone number) is maintained for the purpose of facilitating essential communication and is disseminated only to those members of the Institute administration who have a need to know.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.m. Personnel File Access Policy</strong></p>\n<p>Employees have the legal right to inspect certain documents in their personnel files. Such inspections must occur in the presence of a Human Resources representative at a mutually convenient time.</p>\n<p>Employees may inspect or receive a copy of the personnel records that the Institute maintains relating to your performance or to any grievance concerning you. Certain documents may be excluded or redacted from your personnel file by law, and there are legal limitations on the number of requests that can be made.</p>\n<p>Any request to inspect or copy personnel records must be made in writing to the Human Resources Manager. You may designate a representative to conduct the inspection of the record or receive a copy of the records. However, any designated representative must be authorized by you in writing to inspect or receive a copy of the records. The Institute may take reasonable steps to verify the identity of any representative you have designated in writing to inspect or receive a copy of your personnel records.</p>\n<p>The personnel records may be made available to you either at 437 Pierce Street, Monterey, CA or at a mutually agreeable location (with no loss of compensation for going to that location to inspect or copy the records). The records will be made available no later than 30 calendar days from the date the Institute receives your written request to inspect or copy your personnel records (unless you/your representative and the Institute mutually agree in writing to a date beyond 30 calendar days but no later than 35 calendar days from receipt of the written request).</p>\n<p>Disclosure of personnel information to outside sources, other than your designated representative, will be limited. However, the Institute will cooperate with requests from authorized law enforcement or local, state, or federal agencies conducting official investigations and as otherwise legally required.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.n. Reporting Time &#x26; Payroll Issues</strong></p>\n<p>All employees of the Institute are paid every other Friday on a bi-weekly pay period basis. If a payday falls on a holiday, employees will receive paychecks on the last working day of the week. The pay period begins on Monday and ends on the following second Sunday. The pay calendar can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/offices-services/human-resources/employee-resources\">Employee Resources</a> section of the Institute’s website.</p>\n<p>Hourly and salaried staff are required to use the <a href=\"https://ssb-prod.ec.middlebury.edu/PNTR/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin\">BannerWeb</a> system to record hours worked and leave taken during each pay period. All time must be submitted by 3:00 PM on the Friday prior to the close of the pay period in order to be included in the next paycheck. Failure to submit time by the prescribed deadline may result in disciplinary action. Time reporting procedures for exempt staff are not for the purposes of evaluating the amount or quality of work performed nor for pay purposes, and do not alter the fact that exempt staff are not paid based on the number of hours worked.</p>\n<p>If you feel your check may be inaccurate, first verify that your time was submitted accurately and on time. Issues regarding rate of pay, positions or titles and time off should be directed to Human Resources. Other paycheck issues, such as those involving taxes, should be directed to the Payroll department.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.o. Employment Status</strong></p>\n<p>The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey maintains the following staff employment status definitions. These definitions are used primarily to determine eligibility for benefits. The primary basis for determining employment status is committed hours, defined as regularly scheduled and budgeted hours assigned to a specific position. Regardless of the number of hours actually worked, on-call positions have no committed hours. Human Resources will work collaboratively with managers to determine the classification of each position.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Regular staff employees</em></strong> work on a regular schedule for an unspecified duration and are normally employed for a position as a result of open recruitment. Regular employees may be classified as full-time; part-time benefit eligible; part-time non-benefit eligible.</p>\n<p>If a regular staff employee is classified as exempt, the employee is not paid based on the number of hours worked. If a regular staff employee is classified as non-exempt, the employee is paid based on the number of hours worked AND AN HOURLY RATE OF PAY.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Full-time staff employees</em></strong> are normally scheduled to work 37.5 hours per week. To be classified as full-time for purposes of benefits, an employee must be scheduled to work at least 32 hours per week (1664 hours per year). Full-time staff employees are benefits eligible.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Part-time, benefit eligible staff employees</em></strong> are scheduled to work at least 20 but less than 32 hours per week (between 1000 and 1663 hours per year).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Part-time, non-benefit eligible staff employees</em></strong> are scheduled to work less than 20 hours per week, or less than 1000 hours per year.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Time-limited employees</em></strong> are employed for an assignment of a “not to exceed” specific duration. A time-limited employee is eligible for benefits if the committed hours for his/her position totals 1000 hours in the 12 months following his/her appointment. Postgraduate Fellows are included in this category. Time-limited assignments may be extended; however, the employment status of an employee who works longer than the period originally expected and designated will not automatically change.</p>\n<p><strong><em>On-call staff employees</em></strong> work as needed on an hourly basis. Hours may vary from part-time to full-time. There are no committed hours attached to these positions. On-call staff are not eligible for benefits.</p>\n<p>Staff positions funded from external sources will be classified into the appropriate job status as determined by job assignment and the duration of time that the position is not to exceed.</p>\n<p>All staff employment, regardless of employment status definition, is at-will, at the mutual consent of the employee and the Institute. (See At-Will Employment, below.)</p>\n<p>Part-time and time-limited employees may be ineligible for Institute Benefits. To determine eligibility for specific benefits consult the sections of this handbook addressing those benefits or, if applicable, the Summary Plan Descriptions.</p>\n<p>Independent contractors and consultants are not employees of the Institute and are not entitled to employee benefits. Terms and conditions of their services are set forth in an agreement entered into between the Institute and the contractor.</p>\n<p>If you have any doubt about your status as described above, contact the Manager of Human Resources.</p>\n<p>The Institute reserves the right, at any time, to alter or change job responsibilities, reassign or transfer job positions, or assign additional job responsibilities. From time to time, employees may be asked to work on special projects or to perform other work necessary or important to the operation of the department or the Institute. Cooperation and assistance in performing such additional work is expected.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.p. At-Will Employment</strong></p>\n<p>The administration of The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey hopes that every staff employee will find the employment relationship with the Institute satisfying and rewarding in all respects. At the same time, it recognizes that employment relationships are not always mutually satisfactory. To protect the rights of both staff employee and the Institute, employees should remember that employment is at the mutual consent of the employee and the Institute. As defined by the <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&#x26;division=3.&#x26;title=&#x26;part=&#x26;chapter=2.&#x26;article=4.\">California Labor Code</a>, either the at-will employee or the Institute can terminate the employment relationship, at any time, with or without cause, and with or without advance notice. Staff members who work in positions with a pre-scheduled not to exceed end date, whether funded by grant or contract monies or otherwise known as a “fixed term” position are in at-will status during that time and subject to conclusion of employment at or before the scheduled end date.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.q. Work Schedule</strong></p>\n<p>The Institute normally is open for business between the hours of 8:30 AM and 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday. Some departments, such as the library, are open extended hours. Supervisors are responsible for assigning individual work schedules. Employees are expected to be at their desks or work stations at the start of their scheduled hours, ready to perform their work. The workday (a consecutive 24-hour period) begins at 12:01 AM and ends at midnight. The workweek begins on Monday and ends on Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.r. Telecommuting</strong></p>\n<p>The Institute places a high value on community and quality of service to its students. Generally, this means that faculty and staff need to perform their work on campus with their students and colleagues.  We do recognize, however, that there may be circumstances in which an employee is unable to be present on campus, but could work effectively from another location.  An employee who would like to explore this possibility should first speak with his/her supervisor, who will ascertain whether or not telecommuting is feasible, and if so, work with HR to develop a telecommuting agreement that ensures compliance with relevant state and federal regulations.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.s. Exempt/Non-Exempt Status</strong></p>\n<p>Under state and federal laws regarding overtime pay, the Institute’s executive, administrative and support staff members are classified either overtime exempt or non-exempt. Exempt employees are paid a salary that covers all work and do not receive additional compensation for hours worked beyond their normal workweek. Determination of exempt or non-exempt status is made by Human Resources, based on the employee’s job description, state and federal law, and guidelines issued by the California Industrial Welfare Commission and U.S. Department of Labor.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.t. Compensatory Time Off</strong></p>\n<p>Employees who are non-exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act or the California Labor Code are not granted compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay. All hours worked in excess of the employee’s normal workweek will be compensated as extra pay and should be recorded and submitted in the current pay period.</p>\n<p>Exempt employees are paid a fixed salary intended to provide all of the compensation to which they are entitled. They are not entitled to additional compensation for extra hours of work or time off in lieu of additional compensation. Neither extra compensation nor compensatory time off will be owed or payable to an exempt employee upon separation from the Institute for any reason.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.u. Meal and Rest Periods</strong></p>\n<p>Non-exempt employees working shifts lasting five hours or longer are entitled to a one-hour, unpaid meal period taken approximately in the middle of the work shift. Non-exempt employees working more than six-hour shifts may not “skip” the meal period to shorten the workday. If an employee is not provided a meal break, they will be paid one additional hour of pay at their regular pay rate. They are allowed paid ten-minute rest periods for every four hours of work or major portion thereof. Rest periods should be taken approximately halfway through the four-hour period. Rest periods cannot be combined or saved to create extended meal breaks, leave early, or arrive late. When necessary, supervisors are responsible for scheduling meal and rest periods.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.v. Voting (time off)</strong></p>\n<p>In accordance with California Elections Code section 14000, employees who do not have sufficient time outside of working hours to vote at a statewide election may take off enough working time that — when added to the voting time available outside of working hours — will enable them to vote. The Institute will provide the employee up to two hours of time off with pay to vote. The time off for voting will be only at the beginning or end of the regular work shift, whichever allows the most free time for voting and the least time off from the regular working shifts, unless otherwise mutually agreed.</p>\n<p>If by the third working day prior to the day of election employees know, or have reason to believe, that time off will be necessary to be able to vote on election day, they must give their supervisor at least two working days' notice that time off for voting is desired, in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.w. Call-In Pay (Reporting-Time Pay)</strong></p>\n<p>In accordance with the State of California's Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Order 4-2001, the Institute will pay a minimum of two hours pay to non-exempt employees who are required to report to work on a day other than their normally scheduled workday. In addition, the Institute will pay non-exempt employees for half of the regularly scheduled workday if employees report to work as instructed and there is not work available, except if the interruption of work is because of the failure of any or all public utilities, or because of an act of God or other cause not within the Institute's power to control.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.x. Garnishment of Wages</strong></p>\n<p>The Institute is obligated to comply with all wage garnishment orders. Questions regarding wage garnishment should be directed to Human Resources.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.y. Overtime</strong></p>\n<p>Employees occasionally may be required to work extra hours. Exempt employees may be expected to work beyond their normal schedules, as their job responsibilities require, and do so without additional pay beyond their regular salary. Non-exempt employees receive additional compensation at the rate of time and one-half, for hours worked in addition to 8 hours per workday and/or 40 hours per workweek, up to 12 hours worked and thereafter at double time. For purposes of determining which hours constitute additional time, only actual hours worked in a given work week will be counted;  sick leave taken, jury duty leave, or call-in/reporting time payment do not count towards hours worked. Failure to obtain one’s supervisor’s approval before working overtime may result in disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>A workday begins at 12:01 AM and ends 24 hours later. A workweek begins each Monday at 12:01 AM.</p>\n<p>All regular time and overtime hours must be accurately recorded on the non-exempt employee's timesheet and approved by the supervisor prior to payment. Tampering, altering, or falsifying time records will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.z. Travel Pay</strong></p>\n<p>Exempt employees are not paid on the basis of hours worked, and there is therefore no additional pay or compensatory time for time spent traveling.</p>\n<p>Employees are reimbursed for all out-of-pocket travel expenses allowable under the Institute’s travel guidelines.</p>\n<p>For non-exempt employees, travel time (defined as time spent actively traveling between the normal work site and another location where work will be done) is considered work time and should be recorded as such on the time sheet.</p>\n<p>Commuting time to and from the normal work place is not considered work time and is not compensated. If the employee departs from or returns to his/her home for work-related travel without first going to the normal work location, he/she should deduct the normal commute time from the travel time.</p>\n<p>If the total number of hours worked (including travel) exceeds 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a week, the employee is entitled to overtime pay calculated in accordance with the Institute's normal overtime policy.</p>\n<p>Time spent during the course of travel on sleeping, eating meals, and other personal activities is not considered work time and is not compensated.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.aa. Pay Advances</strong></p>\n<p>The Institute does not provide pay advances.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.bb. Direct Deposits</strong></p>\n<p>Employees are eligible for automatic payroll deposit. They may initiate automatic deposit through the online <a href=\"https://ssb-prod.ec.middlebury.edu/PNTR/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin\">Banner</a> system. Automatic deposit can be started or stopped at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.cc. Payroll Records</strong></p>\n<p>Employees may access their payroll records through the online <a href=\"https://ssb-prod.ec.middlebury.edu/PNTR/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin\">Banner</a> system.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.dd. Performance Evaluations</strong></p>\n<p>Each staff employee is scheduled to receive periodic performance reviews.</p>\n<p>The first review takes place after the initial three months of employment. Employees who transfer to another position within the Institute are reviewed with respect to their original job at the time of transfer, and within three months of assuming the new position. HR will notify the new supervisor when the three month review is due. Subsequent evaluations are normally conducted annually. The employee and the supervisor each complete a written evaluation of the employee’s job performance. They then share their evaluations with each other, and these documents form the basis for a discussion of the employee’s performance and professional development needs. The employee signs the evaluation to indicate that s/he has discussed it with her/his supervisor and is aware of its contents. The signed evaluation is placed in the employee’s personnel file.</p>\n<p>Employees have the right to submit written responses to their evaluations, which will be added to their personnel files. Employee responses should be submitted within five working days of receiving their performance review.</p>\n<p>Performance evaluations are intended to help employees recognize their progress, become aware of areas for improvement, and set objectives or goals for future work performance. Positive performance evaluations do not guarantee increases in salary, promotions, or continued employment. Salary increases and promotions are solely at the discretion of the Institute and depend upon many factors in addition to performance.</p>\n<p>While professional development goals are an expected component of performance evaluations in general, a specific, written performance improvement plan is mandated if an employee receives an unacceptable overall rating on a performance evaluation, if the employee’s employment in that position is to continue thereafter.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.ee. Progressive Discipline</strong></p>\n<p>The Institute may choose in appropriate situations to utilize a progressive discipline system to serve as a fair and consistent means to enforce Institute rules and regulations and to address conduct or performance deficiencies. The purpose of progressive discipline is to retain employees through identification and correction of certain types of problems. Failure to correct such problems may lead to suspension or termination, and serious infractions may result in immediate termination. The Institute reserves the right to terminate the at-will employment of any employee at any time, with or without cause or notice; thus, progressive discipline is applicable or not, at the discretion of the Institute, for those situations deemed appropriate by the Institute.</p>\n<p>If a situation, at the discretion of the Institute, warrants progressive discipline, the disciplinary actions applied may include a verbal warning, a written warning, a written reprimand, and/or termination from employment. Every action need not be taken in each case, and depending upon the relevant circumstances, the Institute may decide to take any disciplinary action, including immediate termination, at any time. Relevant circumstances that affect the course of disciplinary action may include the Institute’s judgment as to the seriousness or severity of the individual employee's deficiencies in performance and/or conduct, prior performance and conduct, and management's assessment of appropriate factors identified during the investigation. Examples of some of the circumstances that in the Institute’s judgment might lead to summary discharge include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct that is in opposition to the Institute's nondiscrimination or harassment policies;</li>\n<li>Sustained insubordination or refusal to comply with a reasonable request given by the supervisor or Institute official, or abusive treatment of a supervisor or Institute official;</li>\n<li>Theft of Institute property, personal property, or theft of service;</li>\n<li>Falsification of records, time cards, or claiming sickness under false pretenses;</li>\n<li>Disorderly conduct while on the job;</li>\n<li>Deliberate, frequent, and/or recurring violations of stated safety regulations, even if they are not intentional;</li>\n<li>Unexcused absence without notice for three days;</li>\n<li>Use or possession of, or being under the influence of illegal substances or alcohol while at work;</li>\n<li>Threatening physical harm, or actual physical violence to another member of the Institute community;</li>\n<li>Breach of confidentiality, which is defined as releasing to unauthorized persons, or misuse of confidential information to which an employee is privy because of her/his job.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>D.1.ff. Promotions and Transfers</strong></p>\n<p>Employees are encouraged to apply for promotions to positions for which they are qualified. Promotions and transfer decisions are based on the hiring supervisor’s and/or his/her supervisor’s judgment of ability, qualifications, and potential for the position. Some promotions or transfers may be offered without open recruitment.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.gg. Employment: Internal Career Opportunities</strong></p>\n<p>All vacant positions are posted on the Institute web site for a minimum of 5 business days and internal candidates have an opportunity to apply unless in a special circumstance a waiver of posting is granted by the president of the College.</p>\n<p>Normally, an employee must have been in her/his current position for a minimum of 3 months before being eligible to apply for positions in other departments. If an employee is selected to interview for a position, and is a final candidate, the employee should inform her/his current supervisor of her/his interest in the new position. If an employee is offered and accepts a position external to her/his current department, coordination between both departments, facilitated by Human Resources, may be required to ensure that the timing of such a transfer does not result in a hardship to the Institute. Normally, the transferring employee will assume her/his new duties two weeks after being selected for the new position.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.hh. Voluntary Termination of Employment/Resignation</strong></p>\n<p>Resignation is defined as employment termination initiated by an employee who chooses to leave the Institute. An employee who is considering leaving the Institute for any reason is encouraged to discuss her/his situation with her/his immediate supervisor before making a final decision.</p>\n<p>If the employee chooses to leave the Institute, it is expected that as much notice as possible will be given in order to give the Institute the opportunity to plan for a smooth transition. At least two working weeks' notice is customary for non-exempt (hourly paid) employees while administrative and professional staff (salaried) are asked to give at least one month’s notice. A letter of resignation addressed to the department head, stating the final date(s) of employment, will be forwarded to Human Resources. Before leaving, the employee must visit the Human Resources Office to make benefit transition arrangements, to return all Institute property, and to have an exit interview with Human Resources.</p>\n<p>An employee who fails to report to work for three consecutively scheduled workdays without notice to, and approval by, her/his supervisor (or the Manager of Human Resources if the supervisor is not available) will be considered to have abandoned her/his job and will be considered to have resigned unless, in the sole judgment of the Institute, a true and reasonable excuse is thereafter offered and accepted by the Institute.</p>\n<p>CTO time may not be taken in lieu of working the last two weeks of employment. The termination date is the actual last day of work. All unused accrued CTO hours will be paid on the employee’s last day of work.</p>\n<p>All Institute-owned property (vehicles, keys, identification cards, parking permit, credit cards, laptop computers, uniforms, etc.) must be returned immediately upon termination of employment in order to receive final payments.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.ii. Institute Re-employment</strong></p>\n<p>Consideration for re-employment is based on qualifications and demonstrated ability, as well as prior job performance and fitness for Institute employment. An employee who was terminated by the Institute in a manner such that the employee left not in good standing may not be re-employed.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.jj. Emeritus Status</strong></p>\n<p>Emeritus status may be granted to retiring staff as a special recognition for exemplary work performance and outstanding, loyal, and dedicated service to the Institute. To be eligible for consideration for Emeritus status, an employee must be in retirement status from the Institute, have at least ten years of service in a full-time regular position, be nominated by the senior administrator of her/his department, and have the approval of the VPAA.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.kk. Retirement</strong></p>\n<p>There is no mandatory retirement age for Institute employees; they may continue working without regard to age, subject to provisions concerning at-will and other termination of employment. Continuing employees nearing age 65 should contact Human Resources regarding Medicare coverage and certain decisions that must be made about health insurance coverage at age 65.</p>\n<p>An employee planning to retire should consult Human Resources six months prior to her/his expected retirement date.</p>\n<p>Retirement plan participants should initiate procedures for receipt of retirement income benefits by writing directly to the retirement plan office. Payment of benefits to any continuing employee who participates in a retirement plan is subject to terms established by that plan.</p>\n<p>Although the Institute has no retirement age, work restrictions may be imposed under TIAA-CREF. Employees should refer to the TIAA-CREF summary plan description for details.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.ll. Reductions in Force</strong></p>\n<p>Under some circumstances, the Institute may restructure or reduce its workforce. If so, the Institute will make a reasonable effort to inform affected employees in advance. Employees to be laid off will be told the expected duration of the layoff if known. In determining which employees will be laid off, the Institute will identify the positions to be reduced and in selecting for retention among staff members performing in the same position to be reduced, will consider its operating requirements and other factors, including employees’ skills, productivity, ability, past performance, and, where other factors are equal in its judgment, their length of service.</p>\n<p><strong>D.1.mm. Exit Interview</strong></p>\n<p>Employees ending employment at the Institute, whether voluntarily or involuntarily are strongly encouraged to meet with Human Resources staff for an exit interview. This interview will normally occur on or before the employee’s final workday. During the interview, the Manager of Human Resources or designee may ask for information about working conditions and the employee’s relationship with her/his supervisor and fellow staff members and will discuss employment benefits conversion. The employee also will have the opportunity to suggest ways to improve Institute operations. It is the employee’s responsibility to return all Institute property (vehicles, keys, identification cards, parking permit, credit cards, laptop computers, uniforms, etc.) by her/his final day of employment.</p>"},"f4492d60-531d-5e08-b4d9-4a84dff4a09b":{"id":"f4492d60-531d-5e08-b4d9-4a84dff4a09b","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/d-employee-handbook/d-2-employee-relations","title":"D.2. Employee Relations","body":"\n**D.2.a. Problem Solving Procedure**\n\nThe Institute strives to maintain effective employer-employee and employee-employee relations within the context of the at-will employment relationship. The Institute seeks to promote open communication between its employees with appropriate involvement of Human Resources, if necessary, to facilitate a resolution of employee concerns. Employees are encouraged to bring concerns directly to the attention of their immediate supervisor or, if uncomfortable in doing so, to their second level manager, or Human Resources. If the concern remains unresolved, formal Institute resources should be engaged through the Human Resources office. After a minimum of two rounds of problem solving involving a member of the Human Resources Office, the employee may file a grievance.\n\n**D.2.b. Grievance Procedure**\n\nIndividuals who are actively employed by the Institute may avail themselves of the grievance procedures if an issue concerns a person, situation, or policy that the employee believes is adversely impacting her/his conditions of employment. A grievance is understood to be a work-related problem, condition, or complaint not covered by the Institute's harassment policy that an employee believes to be unfair, inequitable, discriminatory, or a hindrance to her/his effective operation. Concerns regarding harassment or other behaviors noted in the Institute's harassment policy, salary surveys, wage and salary levels, position description re-evaluation, and job dates are not appropriate for the grievance process but other procedures are available. The grievance policy also does not apply to issues related to faculty contract renewal and promotion, or faculty misconduct as described in the Faculty handbook.\n\nIf an employee believes that s/he is being subjected to harassment or other behavior noted in the Institute's harassment policy, then s/he should promptly present a complaint under the Institute's harassment policy set forth above in this Handbook.\n\nThe employee must have attempted the problem solving process (see above) prior to filing a grievance.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**A. Filing a Grievance**\n\nThe formal grievance process begins with the creation of a written document detailing the situation. Specifically, the grievance must provide the following information:\n\n- the employee's name,\n- what s/he does,\n- what the grievance is,\n- how it relates to her/his employment,\n- how the problem could be resolved,\n- who the other parties are,\n- what policies are involved, and\n- what has been done to date to resolve the problem or concern.\n\nThe grievance must be sent to the Human Resources Manager (or, in the event that the grievance is with the Human Resources Manager, to the HR Manager’s supervisor).\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**B. Formation of the Grievance Review Committee**\n\nUpon receipt of the written grievance, the Human Resources Manager creates a Grievance Review Committee (GRC). The three-member GRC consists of one person from Human Resources and two disinterested and impartial members of the Institute employee community drawn from departments or sectors other than those of the parties to the grievance. In appointing GRC members, care is taken to avoid direct supervisors, known personal relationships, or other conflicts of interest that could hinder an impartial decision. GRC appointees are charged with upholding the confidentiality of all proceedings.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**C. Timeframes**\n\nGenerally, Human Resources will acknowledge the receipt of the grievance and the formation of the GRC within one week of receiving the grievance. Within one week of its formation, the GRC will meet with the employee. Due to CTO/holiday schedules and illness, a specific timeframe for the process cannot be made. The GRC will complete its charge as soon as possible.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**D. GRC Initial Meeting**\n\nOnce the members have been selected and confirmed, the GRC convenes its first meeting. The focus of the initial meeting is to:\n\n- select a chairperson to facilitate the meetings.\n- choose a recorder to record the meetings.\n- meet with the employee who filed the grievance and review the grievance with her/him.\n\nDuring the meeting with the employee who has filed the grievance, the GRC must ascertain that:\n\n- the grievance is not a simple misunderstanding that can be resolved immediately by the GRC,\n- the grievance contains the required information, and\n- the GRC understands the grievance.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**E. Possible Outcomes**\n\nUpon completion of the initial meeting of the GRC, there are a variety of possible decisions that may be made. They include the following:\n\n- the employee may withdraw the grievance,\n- the GRC and the employee may come to the realization that the grievance has been resolved,\n- the grievance may be edited and refiled, or\n- the grievance may remain unchanged.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**F. Continuing the Process**\n\nIf the decision to continue the grievance is made, the GRC will:\n\n- begin gathering facts pertaining to the grievance,\n- review Institute policies and procedures, and\n- meet with all parties pertinent to the grievance in an attempt to resolve the situation.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**G. Making the Determination**\n\nOnce the GRC has reached a decision, it will meet with all major parties to the grievance and share its findings. The decision will be communicated to the appropriate individuals within the Institute administration for implementation. The decision of the GRC is final unless appealed or unless in her/his sole discretion, the VPAA alters the committee decision.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**H. Documentation**\n\nIn order to make certain that documentation pertaining to the grievance process is created, maintained, and kept confidential, the following steps are taken:\n\n- The GRC maintains written meeting summaries.\n- All meeting participants sign every summary.\n- Information is shared with individuals external to the meetings only upon unanimous agreement of the participants.\n- A copy of all work done by the GRC will be placed in an envelope and stored in a separate file (i.e., not the employee's personnel file) in the Human Resources Office as a confidential item.\n\nOnce an employee has filed a grievance concerning a particular issue, another grievance on the same issue cannot be filed. For example, if an employee files a grievance regarding a particular section of her/his annual performance review, a grievance pertaining to a different section of the same review cannot be filed at a later date.\n\n**D.2.c. Appealing a Grievance Decision**\n\nThere are times when an employee, after following the informal and formal procedures outlined above, may believe that satisfactory resolution was not attained. The Institute has established staff appeals procedures to provide a fair and impartial process of which employees may avail themselves under certain conditions to appeal grievance decisions. The conditions under which an employee may file a grievance appeal are:\n\n- new evidence,\n- demonstrable prejudice violative of Institute policy in the original GRC's actions, and/or\n- failure by the GRC to follow the grievance procedures.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**A. Grievance Appeals**\n\nIn order to initiate the grievance appeals process, the employee must submit a written request to the VPAA of the Institute within ten working days following notification of the decision. Contained within the written request must be reasons for the appeal.\n\nWithin five working days of receipt of the request, the VPAA or her/his designee appoints an Appeals Board to hear the appeal.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**B. Composition of the Appeals Board**\n\nIn order to assure the creation of a well-balanced, impartial board, the 3-member Appeals Board is composed of:\n\n- One administrator from the VPAA’s senior staff\n- One staff member\n- One faculty member\n\nTo ensure impartiality and fairness, no one is eligible to serve on the Appeals Board who heard the original case, has a conflict of interest, or is the senior administrator of any of the parties involved. Conflict of interest includes employment in the same department, or family relationship with any person involved as a principal in the case, or other relationship/circumstance that might render the process unfair to any parties involved.\n\nThe names of the Appeals Board members are conveyed in writing by the VPAA or designee to the two parties within 5 working days of initiating the appeals process. The VPAA or designee convenes the Appeals Board no later than ten working days after initiation of the appeals process.\n\nUpon selection to the Appeals Board, if a designee is unable to participate in the hearing in a fair and impartial manner for any reason, s/he will be disqualified and another person selected. Attendance at all meetings is required.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**C. The Initial Meeting of the Appeals Board**\n\nWithin ten days of the initiation of the appeals process, the Appeals Board convenes its first meeting. The focus of the initial meeting is to:\n\n- choose a chairperson to facilitate the meetings.\n- choose a recorder to record the meetings.\n- review the written request for an appeal.\n- determine whether the appeal has merit.\n- set timelines for the appeal.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**D. The Grievance Appeal Process**\n\nThe Appeals Board holds individual and collective responsibility for deliberating in a manner that demonstrates sensitivity to the matters brought forth and respect for those involved in the process. To that end, all proceedings of the Appeals Board are kept confidential.\n\nThe Appeals Board provides all sides involved the opportunity to present their views as well as cross-examine each other. The appellant and appellee may testify on their own behalf before the Appeals Board. The Appeals Board may make the request of both or either party. While no legal counsel is allowed at a hearing, the appellant and appellee each may bring one support person from the Institute community to the proceedings.\n\nIn cases in which a person who is not called to meet with the Appeals Board wishes to do so, the Appeals Board will vote on whether the meeting may occur. A majority of Appeals Board members are required to allow the person to present information.\n\nIn cases in which additional information is brought forth once the Appeals Board has finished its interviews and begun deliberations, a majority of Appeals Board members need to agree to reopen the hearings.\n\nThe members of the board consider carefully the information presented, and deliberate on the matter before as a board reaching a conclusion. The conclusion is reached by majority vote.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**E. Appeals Determined Not to Be Valid**\n\nIf the Appeals Board determines that the grounds for the appeal are not valid, the appeal process ends.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**F. In Cases Involving New Evidence**\n\nUpon review of the case, if the Appeals Board determines that the grounds for the appeal are valid based upon new evidence presented, the Appeals Board will refer the case back to the original GRC. The new information will be provided with a request that the committee reviews the case.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**G. Documentation**\n\nIn order to make certain that documentation pertaining to the appeal process is created, maintained, and kept confidential, the following steps are taken:\n\n- The Appeals Board maintains written meeting summaries.\n- All meeting participants sign every summary.\n- Information is shared with individuals external to the meetings only upon unanimous agreement of the Appeals Board.\n- A copy of all work done by the Appeals Board will be placed in an envelope and stored in a separate file (i.e., not the employee’s personnel file) in the Human Resources Office as a confidential item.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**H. Conclusions**\n\nUpon reaching a conclusion, the board forwards its decision to the VPAA. In her/his sole discretion, the VPAA may choose to alter or not alter the appeal committee decision. Once the grievance has been through the appeals process, it cannot be appealed further.\n","excerpt":"D.2.a.

CSL: Accrual and Lump-Sum Versions**</span> \n\nThere are two versions of CSL, “Accrual” and “Lump Sum”, each with slightly different rules regarding allocation of time, carryover, and procedures for recording time used.  Other rules such as allowable uses and maximum annual time are the same for both versions of CSL.  The chart below shows the differences:\n\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"70\">\n\n**Version**\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"105\" valign=\"top\">\n\n**Eligible Employee Types**\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"128\">\n\n**CSL Allocation**\n\n</td>\n\n<td>\n\n**Carryover Rules**\n\n</td>\n\n<td>\n\n**Recording Time Used**\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"70\">\n\n**CSL-**\n\n**Accrual**\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"105\">\n\nStudent Employees\n\nNon-Benefits-Eligible-Staff Employees\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"128\">\n\n.0334 hours of CSL are accrued for each hour worked (1 hour of CSL accrues for every 30 hours worked), up to a maximum accrual of 48 hours.\n\n</td>\n\n<td>\n\nAccrued, unused CSL will carry over each year, subject to the 48 hour cap.\n\n</td>\n\n<td>\n\nUse code “CA Sick Leave” on BannerWeb time-sheet.\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"70\">\n\n**CSL-**\n\n**Lump-Sum**\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"105\">\n\nFaculty Employees\n\nDual-Role (Faculty/Staff)\n\nEmployees\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"128\">\n\nReceives a lump sum credit of 24 hours each July 1<sup>st</sup> (or date of hire for new employees).\n\n</td>\n\n<td>\n\nUnused time will be forfeited June 30<sup>th</sup> each year.\n\n</td>\n\n<td>\n\nWithin 3 days of absence notify HR of time used via email.\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**D. Using CSL**</span> \n\nEligible employees:\n\n- Can begin to use available CSL on the 90th day of their employment.\n- Must use CSL in a minimum increment of one hour.\n- Must provide “reasonable advance notification” of their need to use CSL as soon as practicable, either orally or in writing.\n- Who are absent for longer than three days due to illness may be required to give medical evidence of illness and/or medical certification of fitness to return to work.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**E. Protections Under the Law**</span>\n\nThe CA Paid Sick Leave Act contains strong protections for employees. The Act forbids employers from:\n\n- Denying employees the right to use accrued paid sick days (once the 90 waiting period has passed).\n- Taking any action against an employee for using accrued sick days or attempting to exercise the right to use accrued sick days. Prohibited actions include discharge, threat of discharge, demotion, suspension or any manner of discrimination.\n- Retaliating against employees who file complaints alleging violations of the Act, or who cooperate in an investigation or prosecution of an alleged violation or oppose any policy, practice or act prohibited by this law.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**F. Other Important Information**</span>\n\n- CSL is not recognized as hours worked for purposes of overtime pay.\n- Employees are not entitled to be paid for accrued but unused CSL or unused CSL from a lump sum allocation, upon resignation or termination of employment.\n- If an employee is rehired within a year of his or her separation, the Institute will reinstate any unused CSL that was previously accrued/granted and unused.\n- Available CSL balances will show on employee paystubs and may be viewed on Banner Web.\n- An employee based in another state who works in CA for at least 30 days in a year will also be subject to the CSL policy (or the CTO policy, if applicable).\n- Employees who work in cities that have paid sick leave ordinances that are more generous than the California Paid Sick Leave law may be covered by the local ordinance. Contact HR for further information.\n\n**D.3.c. Holidays**\n\nEligibility for holiday pay begins on the date of hire.\n\nTo be eligible for holiday pay, staff employees must be regularly scheduled to work on the day on which the holiday is observed. If employees are required to work on a paid scheduled holiday they will receive Holiday Premium Pay (time and a half).  Benefit-eligible employees required to work on a paid scheduled holiday will receive Holiday Premium Pay in addition to holiday pay. Regular part-time employees receive prorated holiday pay.\n\nThe Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey observes the following paid holidays:\n\n• January 1 (New Year’s Day)\n\n• Martin Luther King Jr.’s Birthday\n\n• Thanksgiving Day and the Friday after\n\n• Christmas Day\n\nThe Institute is closed the week between Christmas Day and New Year’s Day. These are paid holidays for all staff members eligible for holiday pay.\n\nIn addition, the following holidays are considered “floating” holidays:\n\n• Memorial Day\n\n• July 4<sup>th</sup> (Independence Day)\n\n• Labor Day\n\nNormally, the Institute will be closed on these holidays, and all CTO eligible employees will be expected to record CTO time taken on their time sheets. CTO accruals have been expanded from the former schedule of vacation accruals to account for this change.  If a particular department needs to remain open on a floating holiday in order to support an Institute function, employees of that department will be so informed by their manager, and will be able to use their CTO hours on another day.\n\nWhen a holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, it is usually observed on the preceding Friday or the following Monday, respectively. However, the Institute may close on another day or grant other time off within the pay period instead of closing. Any changes to holiday observance will be announced in advance.\n\n**D.3.d. Combined Time Off (CTO)**\n\nEligible staff employees accrue CTO in accordance with the following schedule:\n\n<table border=\"0\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n**Length of Service**\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"160\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n**Hours per Pay Period**\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n**Days per year**\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n0-2 years\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"160\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n7.5\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n26\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n2-10 years\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"160\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n8.94\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n31\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n10-20 years\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"160\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n10.39\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n36\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n20+ years\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"160\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n11.54\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n40\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\nCTO accrual begins on the date of hire.\n\nFaculty and temporary employees are not eligible for CTO.\n\nCTO accrues in hours after each biweekly payroll is run. CTO is not accrued while in an unpaid status.\n\nEmployees must receive approval from their supervisors before they may take time off from work, with or without usage of CTO hours.\n\nEligible part-time staff who qualify for CTO benefits accrue CTO hours on a prorated basis, based on the accrual rate earned by regular full-time employees.\n\nCTO hours taken are considered hours worked for purposes of overtime calculation. The Institute does not allow borrowing against future CTO accrual. CTO will not be paid in lieu of taking time off, except upon termination of employment.\n\nIf an Institute recognized holiday falls during an employee’s scheduled vacation, the employee will receive holiday pay for the day if s/he is eligible for such pay and will not be charged for CTO for the day.\n\nFor full-time employees, CTO accrual ceases when the employee’s CTO account reaches the maximum of 187.5 hours (25 days). Accrual will resume when some CTO is used so that the total number of hours is below the maximum. Prior to reaching the accrual limit, employees may choose to transfer some of their accrued CTO hours into Sick Leave Reserve (SLR), which can be used only for those purposes described under Sick Leave Reserve, below. There is no limit to the number of hours that may be accumulated in SLR. It is the employee’s responsibility to monitor CTO accrual and to make the transfer to SLR in Banner as needed.\n\nThe Institute does not grant any alternative form of compensation for any period of time during which the accrued CTO was at the maximum. It is the employee’s responsibility to keep track of her/his accrued CTO time and CTO days used, and to transfer hours to Sick Leave Reserve as desired.\n\n**D.3.e. Sick Leave Reserve**\n\nEmployees may use CTO hours to provide a cushion for incapacitation due to illness or injury. They may also use hours they have transferred to Sick Leave Reserve. Sick leave reserve may only be used for legitimate illness or injury to the employee or to care for members of the employee's immediate family who are in need of care by the employee due to illness or injury of the eligible immediate family member. (\"Immediate family\" is defined for this purpose as the employee's parent, spouse, domestic partner, child, or sibling; or another closely related person living in the household.) Sick Leave Reserve may also be used for time off for medical and dental appointments. The Institute will not tolerate abuse or misuse of sick leave reserve.\n\nSick leave reserve is not vested and is not payable upon separation of employment. If an employee is absent three consecutive days due to illness or injury, medical evidence of her/his condition may be required before the Institute honors any sick leave reserve usage.\n\nAt retirement, accumulated SLR days may be used to extend a staff employee’s insurance coverage. To be eligible for retirement, a staff member must have worked for the Institute for ten consecutive years after attaining the age of 45.  Every accumulated sick leave reserve day will convert to an insured day (weekends and the holidays listed in this handbook do not reduce Sick Leave Reserve). For each insured day the Institute will pay 100 percent of the premium to continue the medical and dental benefits for the enrolled employee and enrolled eligible dependents, until the end of the month in which the last insurance day is used. _Example:_ _If an employee retires with 30 accumulated sick leave reserve days on July 1, 2010, the employee's converted sick leave reserve would run out on August 12, 2010 and his or her insurance would continue until August 31, 2010._ Retiring part-time employees may transfer CTO hours to SLR prior to their retirement, and these hours will convert to paid insurance days at a conversion rate of 7.5 hours per day. CTO days that are not transferred prior to the last day of employment will be paid as wages in the final paycheck.\n\n**D.3.f. Medical Leave Assistance Fund (MLAF)**\n\nThere are circumstances in which an employee may find him/herself in an emergency medical situation without enough accrued CTO (Combined Time Off) or SLR (Sick Leave Reserve) to cover the amount of time required for the absence. At such times, if the employee meets the prerequisites, he/she may make application to the fund for up to 150 hours of paid sick leave reserve within a 12-month period. Appeals can be made for further use of the Medical Leave Assistance Fund (MLAF) in situations requiring absences of a longer duration.\n\nAn emergency medical situation is defined as the incapacitation of an employee for an extended period of time due to a non-work-related illness or injury or quarantine, which creates a financial hardship as the employee has exhausted all accrued CTO and SLR. The emergency medical situation may relate to either the employee or a member of her/his immediate family.  The latter refers to an employee’s spouse, domestic partner, parent, parent of a spouse, and child, stepchild, foster child, or ward.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**A. Prerequisites for applying to the fund:**</span>\n\n1.     The employee must be employed at the Institute for six-months.\n\n2.     The employee must be eligible to accrue CTO.\n\n3.     Prior to application to the fund, the employee must have exhausted his/her CTO and SLR.\n\n4.     During the time away from work, the employee must not be receiving any disability benefits, worker’s comp payments, or other type of Institute-related payments.\n\n5.     The employee must have received no written warnings or reprimands for excessive absenteeism during the year prior to the request to the Medical Leave Assistance Fund.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**B. Application to the fund:**</span>\n\n1.     The employee or his/her representative, if the employee is medically unable to do so, must request an application form from the Human Resources Office.\n\n2.     The employee or his/her representative must provide all information requested on the application.\n\n3.     The employee’s or immediate family member’s physician must complete a certification form, if FMLA/CFRA is not being used. In cases in which the FMLA/CFRA is applicable, please make note of it on the application form.\n\n4.     The employee or his/her representative must return the completed application and physician’s form to the Human Resources Office.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**C. Administration of the fund:**</span>\n\n1.     Upon receipt of the application, the Manager of Human Resources will review the application for completeness. S/he will review the applicant’s employment information to ensure all eligibility requirements have been met.\n\n2.     Upon review of the application, the Manager will contact the applicant or his/her representative. If the applicant does not meet the requirements, the Manager will advise the employee or his/her representative of the decision.\n\n3.     If all eligibility requirements have been met, the Manager will ask the employee or his/her representative whether his/her name should be used in the staff query.\n\n4.     Once an application has been approved, the Manager will send an e-mail to all benefits eligible staff, advising staff that an application to the fund has been made. The notice will ask that the recipient post the request for those without immediate e-mail access. The employee’s name will be used only if permission was given on both the application and upon interview with the Manager. Staff members who are interested in donating time will complete a donation form and return it to the Manager. While the donation will be made in time increments, the number will be converted to dollars based on the donor’s rate of pay.\n\n5.     Upon receipt of MLAF donations, or if there is residual time in the fund, the Manager will transfer the approved amount of time into the employee’s SLR account. This will be based on the employee’s rate of pay.\n\n6.     The employee will be paid the donated time through the regular biweekly pay process, and therefore will be paid a maximum of 75 hours per pay period depending on his/her regular schedule.\n\n_Example:_ An employee makes application for one week’s amount of SLR and is approved for funding. The applicant makes $8.00/hour and works a 37.5 hour workweek. This translates into a maximum of $300/week that can be requested per week. The donor makes $12.00/hour and works a 37.5 hour workweek. This translates into a donation of $450 for one week’s worth of CTO. Upon distribution of the donated time, the approved applicant will receive $300 while the MLAF will contain a balance of $150 to be used in the future by other approved applicants. The remaining amount will not be re-deposited into the donor’s CTO account.\n\n7.     If no donations are made and there is no balance in the fund, the applicant will not receive any payment. If partial funding of the approved applicant’s request can be made, it will be paid. The remainder cannot be made up in a future payment.\n\n#### **<span style=\"color: #660000;\">D. Donation to the fund</span>**\n\nAn employee who has a minimum of 80 hours of CTO and/or SLR may make a maximum contribution of 10 hours of **CTO** to the MLA fund. This is done by completing the Donor form and sending it to the Manager of Human Resources. SLR and/or CTO hours cannot be donated to the Medical Leave Assistance Fund upon notification of termination of employment.\n\n**D.3.g. Social Security & Medicare (FICA)**\n\nIn compliance with the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), the Institute contributes one-half of the total tax prescribed by law, and each employee contributes one-half through payroll deductions. Social Security provides retirement benefits, disability benefits, life insurance/survivor benefits, and medical insurance. Please direct all questions concerning social security coverage to the local offices of the Social Security Administration.\n\n**D.3.h. Insurance Benefits**\n\nRegular staff members who normally are scheduled, and who work 20 hours or more per week, are eligible for enrollment in the Institute’s medical, dental, vision, long-term disability, and life insurance programs.\n\nCoverage is effective the first day of the month coinciding with or following the date of employment. The enrollment period is for 30 days from the date of eligibility.\n\nInstitute Employees participate in the Middlebury College Health and Welfare Benefits plans. For details about eligibility and coverage, please see the Summary Plan Descriptions for each benefit program, provided to each eligible employee and available from the Human Resources Office.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**A. Medical Insurance**</span>\n\nThe Institute currently provides a comprehensive medical insurance plan for employees and their eligible dependents. The employee’s contribution, determined by the President and approved by the Board of Trustees, will be deducted each pay period for the elected coverage.\n\nDependent coverage, which is substantially subsidized by the Institute at this time, is available at the employee’s option. The employee contribution for dependent coverage is paid through payroll deduction.\n\nIn the event of an increase in medical insurance premium rates, employees may be required to contribute to the cost of increased premiums to retain coverage. Notice of such increases will be made to employees as they occur.\n\nWhen employees terminate employment (and under certain other circumstances), except in cases of gross misconduct, they have the option of continuing insurance benefits at their own cost plus a minor administration fee, as provided by the federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). Specific information on COBRA can be obtained from Human Resources, and will be provided when employees enroll in the benefits plans and when they end qualifying employment at the Institute.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**B. Dental and Vision Insurance**</span>\n\nThe Institute currently provides dental and vision insurance plans for qualified employees and their eligible dependents. Dependent coverage is at the employee’s option and expense, and is paid through payroll deduction. Please refer to the applicable Summary Plan Description, available from the Human Resources Office, for details of the plans.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**C. Long-Term Disability Insurance**</span>\n\nThe Institute currently provides a long-term disability (LTD) insurance plan for qualified employees. LTD insurance provides partial income replacement for long-term absence when an employee is totally disabled. Please refer to the Summary Plan Description, available from the Human Resources Office, for details of the plan.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**D. Life Insurance**</span>\n\nThe Institute currently provides a life insurance plan for qualified employees. Benefit level is determined by base salary. Please contact the Human Resources Office for details of the plan.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**E. Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance**</span>\n\nThe Institute currently offers Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance (AD&D) for qualified employees and their eligible dependents. Employees pay the full premium for this optional coverage through payroll deduction. Contact the Human Resources Office for details of the plan.\n\n**D.3\\. i. Literacy Education**\n\nCalifornia Labor Code Sections 1040-1044 require employers to reasonably accommodate and assist employees in need of literacy education. Institute employees wishing to improve their literacy should contact Human Resources. The Institute itself does not offer literacy education, but Human Resources can provide assistance in the following ways:\n\n• helping employees enroll in adult literacy education programs;\n\n• arranging for literacy education providers to visit the Institute; or\n\n• providing contact information for local literacy education programs.\n\nThe Institute will attempt to assist the employee if the accommodation requested would not result in an undue hardship. The Institute does not provide paid time-off for participation in such programs.\n\n**D.3.j. Employee and Family Assistance Program**\n\nThe employee assistance program, provided through E4, helps employees and their family members with personal problems. It is available at no cost to all Institute employees and their family members. Employee assistance is confidential; when an employee or family member contacts the program, the employee’s supervisor will not be informed. The goal of the program is to assist staff members to resolve personal problems before they adversely affect an employee’s ability to perform her/his job effectively. For more information go to the [e4Health](https://www.helloe4.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.helloe4.com%2F&reauth=1) website.\n\n**D.3.k. Retirement Plan**\n\nThe Middlebury College retirement program includes 401(a), 403(b), and 457(b) plans, all of which are administered by TIAA-CREF.  The plans are designed to offer various advantages to eligible employees, such as a generous employer contribution, tax advantages, and retirement, death, and disability benefits. For information regarding eligibility, contributions, benefits and tax status, contact the Human Resources Office. As a condition of employment, eligible employees are required to participate in the 401(a) plan (called the “Core Retirement Plan”). Employees who are not eligible to participate in the group retirement plan, and who wish to contribute to an individual plan available through payroll deduction, should contact the Human Resources Office for more information.\n\n**D.3.l. State Disability Insurance (SDI)**\n\nEach employee, except those who claim valid exemption, currently contributes to the State of California to provide disability insurance pursuant to the California Unemployment Insurance Code. Contributions are made through a payroll deduction. Coverage begins with the first day of employment and applies without regard to the number of hours worked per day or length of contract.\n\nDisability insurance is payable when an employee cannot work because of illness or injury not caused by employment at the Institute or when an employee is entitled to temporary workers’ compensation at a rate less than the daily disability benefit amount.\n\nUnemployment insurance and disability insurance benefits cannot be paid for the same period.\n\nIt is Institute policy to integrate SDI payments with salary continuance payments for covered disabilities (see sick leave policy). Specific rules and regulations governing disability are available from the Human Resources Office.\n\n**D.3.m. Flexible spending accounts**\n\nSometimes referred to as a cafeteria plan, flex plan, or a Section 125 plan, a Flexible Benefits Plan lets you set aside a certain amount of your paycheck into an account before paying income taxes. During the year you have access to this account for reimbursement of expenses you regularly pay, such as health-care and dependent daycare. When you use tax-free dollars to pay for these expenses, you realize an increase in your spending power and substantial tax savings.\n\nAdditional information about options and limitations is available in the HR office.\n\n**D.3.n. Employee Educational Assistance**\n\nAfter one year of benefits-qualifying employment, full-time employees and part-time benefits-eligible employees may register tuition-free for one Institute course or four units, whichever is greater, per term or semester. A tuition credit form, available from the Human Resources Office, must be completed and signed by the employee and his/her supervisor,  and by representatives of the registrar’s, cashier’s and HR offices. If the course is scheduled during normal working hours of a non-exempt staff member, an amended work schedule for the semester or duration of the course must be submitted for the file in the Human Resources Office.\n\nTuition benefits above $5,250 are taxable, and taxes will be withheld from employee’s pay during the semester of attendance, as required by the IRS.\n\n**D.3.o. Educational Assistance for Dependents of Employees**\n\nAfter one year of qualifying employment, a full time employee’s dependents may register for up to and including a full load of courses free of tuition. Dependents include spouses; domestic partners; and dependent children as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of the United States. Dependents of part-time staff are not eligible for tuition credit. A tuition credit form, available from the Human Resources Office, must be completed and signed by the employee and by representatives of the registrar, cashier and HR offices.\n\nThe services of the Custom Language Services (CLS) are not included in this benefit.\n\nIf an employee uses this benefit for an eligible dependent, that dependent may not also, in the same semester, receive a merit scholarship from the Middlebury Institute. The employee and his/her dependent must choose between using the benefit and accepting a scholarship.\n\nThis is a taxable benefit, and taxes will be withheld from the employee’s pay during the semester of attendance, as required by the IRS. Please consult with HR to assess the financial implications of accepting this benefit.\n\nQuestions about merit scholarships should be addressed to the office of enrollment management.  Other questions having to do with student financing should be addressed to the office of financial aid.\n\n**D.3.p. Unemployment Compensation**\n\nThe Institute currently contributes as required to the California Unemployment Insurance Fund on behalf of its employees. Coverage begins with the first day of employment and applies without regard to the number of hours worked per day or length of contract. For further information, contact the Human Resources Office.\n\n**D.3.q. Workers' Compensation**\n\nEmployees are currently protected by the Institute's workers' compensation insurance policy while employed at the Institute, at no cost to the employee. The policy covers an employee in case of occupational injury or illness. Coverage begins with the first day of employment and applies without regard to the number of hours worked per day or length of contract. Benefits may include:\n\n- payment of all medical expenses related to the accident or illness,\n- weekly payments, tax-free, based on Institute salary to partially cover lost wages, and\n- vocational rehabilitation to help qualified injured employees return to suitable employment.\n\nSince workers' compensation payments are less than normal salary, an employee may elect to use part of her/his sick leave reserve and CTO accrual in addition to the workers' compensation payment in an effort to maintain full salary during the time off work.\n\nIf an employee is injured on the job, s/he must notify her/his supervisor and the Human Resources Office immediately. If medical treatment is needed, Human Resources staff will assist with arranging appropriate medical care. If an employee has sustained a serious injury, someone nearby should call 911 for emergency medical care and then inform the supervisor and the Human Resources Office.\n\nIf an employee wishes to be treated by her/his personal physician in the case of a work-related injury, the employee should make sure that the Human Resources office is aware of this ahead of time by making the request in writing. The request will be placed on file in the Human Resources Office.\n\nAfter an employee has received medical care, s/he must provide the Human Resources Office and her/his supervisor certification from her/his health care provider regarding the need for workers' compensation disability leave (if any) and her/his ability to return to work from the leave.\n\nThe Institute or its insurer will not be liable for the payment of workers' compensation benefits for any injury that arises out of voluntary participation in any off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity that is not part of work-related duties.\n\nThe law requires that the Institute notify the workers' compensation insurance company of any concerns of false or fraudulent claims. Any person who makes or causes to be made any knowingly false or fraudulent material statement or material misrepresentation for the purpose of obtaining or denying workers' compensation benefits or payments is guilty of a felony.\n\nFor further information, please contact the Human Resources Office.\n\n**D.3.r. Paid Family Leave**\n\nEmployees may be eligible for up to six weeks of state-provided paid family leave (PFL) insurance benefits when they take time off for one of the following purposes:\n\n- To bond with a child during the first 12 months after the child's birth or placement for adoption or foster care with the employee; or\n- To care for an immediate family member (spouse, registered domestic partner, child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling and parent-in-law as defined by the PFL law) who is seriously ill and requires care.\n\nThe PFL benefits described in this policy are a state-provided partial wage replacement benefit, not a protected leave of absence. To obtain approval for a leave of absence for the reasons set forth above, employees must contact Human Resources and comply with applicable eligibility, notice and certification requirements when required by state or federal law.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**A. Amount and Duration of Benefits**</span> \n\nThe weekly benefit amount is generally 60 or 70 percent of the employee's earnings (depending upon the employee's income), with benefits capped at a state-imposed maximum weekly benefit amount. Employees may receive up to six weeks of PFL benefits during a 12-month period, but may not receive more benefits than earned in wages during the base period for calculating benefits (generally, the 12 months prior to the quarter in which the claim is made).\n\nWhen applicable, PFL benefits will run concurrently with leave time available under the California Family Rights Act and the federal Family and Medical Leave Act. Employees may use any accrued but unused sick leave prior to receiving PFL benefits. Employees are required to use any accrued but unused CTO, up to a maximum of two weeks prior to receiving PFL benefits. Employees may choose to use accrued but unused paid time in excess of two weeks.\n\nEmployees should inform Human Resources as soon as they become aware of circumstances that may trigger eligibility for benefits under any of these programs. Although these programs are funded and run by the state and all eligibility and benefit decisions are made by the state agencies involved, not by the Institute, Human Resources will assist you in obtaining additional information about these programs.\n","excerpt":"In addition to the general description of benefits provided below, employees should consult the summary plan descriptions provided for each…","html":"<p>In addition to the general description of benefits provided below, employees should consult the summary plan descriptions provided for each specific plan.

Allowable Uses</strong></span> </h4>\n<p>Up to 24 hours per year of California Paid Sick Leave (CSL) may be used for the diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition or for the preventive care of an employee, or an employee’s immediate family member. Covered family members include spouses, registered domestic partners, children, parents (including step-parents and parents-in-law), grandparents, grandchildren and siblings. Paid sick days are also available for employees who are the victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.</p>\n<p>CSL may not be used for “personal” absences or as vacation time.<span> </span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>B. Eligibility</strong></span></h4>\n<p>CSL benefits are available for all faculty and all student employees as well as staff employees classified as non-benefits-eligible who have worked for the Institute in California for 30 or more days within a year from the commencement of employment.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>C. CSL: Accrual and Lump-Sum Versions</strong></span> </h4>\n<p>There are two versions of CSL, “Accrual” and “Lump Sum”, each with slightly different rules regarding allocation of time, carryover, and procedures for recording time used.  Other rules such as allowable uses and maximum annual time are the same for both versions of CSL.  The chart below shows the differences:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"70\">\n<p><strong>Version</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"105\" valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>Eligible Employee Types</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"128\">\n<p><strong>CSL Allocation</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Carryover Rules</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Recording Time Used</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"70\">\n<p><strong>CSL-</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Accrual</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"105\">\n<p>Student Employees</p>\n<p>Non-Benefits-Eligible-Staff Employees</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"128\">\n<p>.0334 hours of CSL are accrued for each hour worked (1 hour of CSL accrues for every 30 hours worked), up to a maximum accrual of 48 hours.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Accrued, unused CSL will carry over each year, subject to the 48 hour cap.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Use code “CA Sick Leave” on BannerWeb time-sheet.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"70\">\n<p><strong>CSL-</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lump-Sum</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"105\">\n<p>Faculty Employees</p>\n<p>Dual-Role (Faculty/Staff)</p>\n<p>Employees</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"128\">\n<p>Receives a lump sum credit of 24 hours each July 1<sup>st</sup> (or date of hire for new employees).</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Unused time will be forfeited June 30<sup>th</sup> each year.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Within 3 days of absence notify HR of time used via email.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>D. Using CSL</strong></span> </h4>\n<p>Eligible employees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can begin to use available CSL on the 90th day of their employment.</li>\n<li>Must use CSL in a minimum increment of one hour.</li>\n<li>Must provide “reasonable advance notification” of their need to use CSL as soon as practicable, either orally or in writing.</li>\n<li>Who are absent for longer than three days due to illness may be required to give medical evidence of illness and/or medical certification of fitness to return to work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>E. Protections Under the Law</strong></span></h4>\n<p>The CA Paid Sick Leave Act contains strong protections for employees. The Act forbids employers from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Denying employees the right to use accrued paid sick days (once the 90 waiting period has passed).</li>\n<li>Taking any action against an employee for using accrued sick days or attempting to exercise the right to use accrued sick days. Prohibited actions include discharge, threat of discharge, demotion, suspension or any manner of discrimination.</li>\n<li>Retaliating against employees who file complaints alleging violations of the Act, or who cooperate in an investigation or prosecution of an alleged violation or oppose any policy, practice or act prohibited by this law.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>F. Other Important Information</strong></span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>CSL is not recognized as hours worked for purposes of overtime pay.</li>\n<li>Employees are not entitled to be paid for accrued but unused CSL or unused CSL from a lump sum allocation, upon resignation or termination of employment.</li>\n<li>If an employee is rehired within a year of his or her separation, the Institute will reinstate any unused CSL that was previously accrued/granted and unused.</li>\n<li>Available CSL balances will show on employee paystubs and may be viewed on Banner Web.</li>\n<li>An employee based in another state who works in CA for at least 30 days in a year will also be subject to the CSL policy (or the CTO policy, if applicable).</li>\n<li>Employees who work in cities that have paid sick leave ordinances that are more generous than the California Paid Sick Leave law may be covered by the local ordinance. Contact HR for further information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>D.3.c. Holidays</strong></p>\n<p>Eligibility for holiday pay begins on the date of hire.</p>\n<p>To be eligible for holiday pay, staff employees must be regularly scheduled to work on the day on which the holiday is observed. If employees are required to work on a paid scheduled holiday they will receive Holiday Premium Pay (time and a half).  Benefit-eligible employees required to work on a paid scheduled holiday will receive Holiday Premium Pay in addition to holiday pay. Regular part-time employees receive prorated holiday pay.</p>\n<p>The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey observes the following paid holidays:</p>\n<p>• January 1 (New Year’s Day)</p>\n<p>• Martin Luther King Jr.’s Birthday</p>\n<p>• Thanksgiving Day and the Friday after</p>\n<p>• Christmas Day</p>\n<p>The Institute is closed the week between Christmas Day and New Year’s Day. These are paid holidays for all staff members eligible for holiday pay.</p>\n<p>In addition, the following holidays are considered “floating” holidays:</p>\n<p>• Memorial Day</p>\n<p>• July 4<sup>th</sup> (Independence Day)</p>\n<p>• Labor Day</p>\n<p>Normally, the Institute will be closed on these holidays, and all CTO eligible employees will be expected to record CTO time taken on their time sheets. CTO accruals have been expanded from the former schedule of vacation accruals to account for this change.  If a particular department needs to remain open on a floating holiday in order to support an Institute function, employees of that department will be so informed by their manager, and will be able to use their CTO hours on another day.</p>\n<p>When a holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, it is usually observed on the preceding Friday or the following Monday, respectively. However, the Institute may close on another day or grant other time off within the pay period instead of closing. Any changes to holiday observance will be announced in advance.</p>\n<p><strong>D.3.d. Combined Time Off (CTO)</strong></p>\n<p>Eligible staff employees accrue CTO in accordance with the following schedule:</p>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><strong>Length of Service</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"160\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><strong>Hours per Pay Period</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p><strong>Days per year</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p>0-2 years</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"160\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p>7.5</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p>26</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p>2-10 years</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"160\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p>8.94</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p>31</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p>10-20 years</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"160\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p>10.39</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p>36</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p>20+ years</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"160\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p>11.54</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p>40</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>CTO accrual begins on the date of hire.</p>\n<p>Faculty and temporary employees are not eligible for CTO.</p>\n<p>CTO accrues in hours after each biweekly payroll is run. CTO is not accrued while in an unpaid status.</p>\n<p>Employees must receive approval from their supervisors before they may take time off from work, with or without usage of CTO hours.</p>\n<p>Eligible part-time staff who qualify for CTO benefits accrue CTO hours on a prorated basis, based on the accrual rate earned by regular full-time employees.</p>\n<p>CTO hours taken are considered hours worked for purposes of overtime calculation. The Institute does not allow borrowing against future CTO accrual. CTO will not be paid in lieu of taking time off, except upon termination of employment.</p>\n<p>If an Institute recognized holiday falls during an employee’s scheduled vacation, the employee will receive holiday pay for the day if s/he is eligible for such pay and will not be charged for CTO for the day.</p>\n<p>For full-time employees, CTO accrual ceases when the employee’s CTO account reaches the maximum of 187.5 hours (25 days). Accrual will resume when some CTO is used so that the total number of hours is below the maximum. Prior to reaching the accrual limit, employees may choose to transfer some of their accrued CTO hours into Sick Leave Reserve (SLR), which can be used only for those purposes described under Sick Leave Reserve, below. There is no limit to the number of hours that may be accumulated in SLR. It is the employee’s responsibility to monitor CTO accrual and to make the transfer to SLR in Banner as needed.</p>\n<p>The Institute does not grant any alternative form of compensation for any period of time during which the accrued CTO was at the maximum. It is the employee’s responsibility to keep track of her/his accrued CTO time and CTO days used, and to transfer hours to Sick Leave Reserve as desired.</p>\n<p><strong>D.3.e. Sick Leave Reserve</strong></p>\n<p>Employees may use CTO hours to provide a cushion for incapacitation due to illness or injury. They may also use hours they have transferred to Sick Leave Reserve. Sick leave reserve may only be used for legitimate illness or injury to the employee or to care for members of the employee's immediate family who are in need of care by the employee due to illness or injury of the eligible immediate family member. (\"Immediate family\" is defined for this purpose as the employee's parent, spouse, domestic partner, child, or sibling; or another closely related person living in the household.) Sick Leave Reserve may also be used for time off for medical and dental appointments. The Institute will not tolerate abuse or misuse of sick leave reserve.</p>\n<p>Sick leave reserve is not vested and is not payable upon separation of employment. If an employee is absent three consecutive days due to illness or injury, medical evidence of her/his condition may be required before the Institute honors any sick leave reserve usage.</p>\n<p>At retirement, accumulated SLR days may be used to extend a staff employee’s insurance coverage. To be eligible for retirement, a staff member must have worked for the Institute for ten consecutive years after attaining the age of 45.  Every accumulated sick leave reserve day will convert to an insured day (weekends and the holidays listed in this handbook do not reduce Sick Leave Reserve). For each insured day the Institute will pay 100 percent of the premium to continue the medical and dental benefits for the enrolled employee and enrolled eligible dependents, until the end of the month in which the last insurance day is used. <em>Example:</em> <em>If an employee retires with 30 accumulated sick leave reserve days on July 1, 2010, the employee's converted sick leave reserve would run out on August 12, 2010 and his or her insurance would continue until August 31, 2010.</em> Retiring part-time employees may transfer CTO hours to SLR prior to their retirement, and these hours will convert to paid insurance days at a conversion rate of 7.5 hours per day. CTO days that are not transferred prior to the last day of employment will be paid as wages in the final paycheck.</p>\n<p><strong>D.3.f. Medical Leave Assistance Fund (MLAF)</strong></p>\n<p>There are circumstances in which an employee may find him/herself in an emergency medical situation without enough accrued CTO (Combined Time Off) or SLR (Sick Leave Reserve) to cover the amount of time required for the absence. At such times, if the employee meets the prerequisites, he/she may make application to the fund for up to 150 hours of paid sick leave reserve within a 12-month period. Appeals can be made for further use of the Medical Leave Assistance Fund (MLAF) in situations requiring absences of a longer duration.</p>\n<p>An emergency medical situation is defined as the incapacitation of an employee for an extended period of time due to a non-work-related illness or injury or quarantine, which creates a financial hardship as the employee has exhausted all accrued CTO and SLR. The emergency medical situation may relate to either the employee or a member of her/his immediate family.  The latter refers to an employee’s spouse, domestic partner, parent, parent of a spouse, and child, stepchild, foster child, or ward.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>A. Prerequisites for applying to the fund:</strong></span></h4>\n<p>1.     The employee must be employed at the Institute for six-months.</p>\n<p>2.     The employee must be eligible to accrue CTO.</p>\n<p>3.     Prior to application to the fund, the employee must have exhausted his/her CTO and SLR.</p>\n<p>4.     During the time away from work, the employee must not be receiving any disability benefits, worker’s comp payments, or other type of Institute-related payments.</p>\n<p>5.     The employee must have received no written warnings or reprimands for excessive absenteeism during the year prior to the request to the Medical Leave Assistance Fund.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>B. Application to the fund:</strong></span></h4>\n<p>1.     The employee or his/her representative, if the employee is medically unable to do so, must request an application form from the Human Resources Office.</p>\n<p>2.     The employee or his/her representative must provide all information requested on the application.</p>\n<p>3.     The employee’s or immediate family member’s physician must complete a certification form, if FMLA/CFRA is not being used. In cases in which the FMLA/CFRA is applicable, please make note of it on the application form.</p>\n<p>4.     The employee or his/her representative must return the completed application and physician’s form to the Human Resources Office.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>C. Administration of the fund:</strong></span></h4>\n<p>1.     Upon receipt of the application, the Manager of Human Resources will review the application for completeness. S/he will review the applicant’s employment information to ensure all eligibility requirements have been met.</p>\n<p>2.     Upon review of the application, the Manager will contact the applicant or his/her representative. If the applicant does not meet the requirements, the Manager will advise the employee or his/her representative of the decision.</p>\n<p>3.     If all eligibility requirements have been met, the Manager will ask the employee or his/her representative whether his/her name should be used in the staff query.</p>\n<p>4.     Once an application has been approved, the Manager will send an e-mail to all benefits eligible staff, advising staff that an application to the fund has been made. The notice will ask that the recipient post the request for those without immediate e-mail access. The employee’s name will be used only if permission was given on both the application and upon interview with the Manager. Staff members who are interested in donating time will complete a donation form and return it to the Manager. While the donation will be made in time increments, the number will be converted to dollars based on the donor’s rate of pay.</p>\n<p>5.     Upon receipt of MLAF donations, or if there is residual time in the fund, the Manager will transfer the approved amount of time into the employee’s SLR account. This will be based on the employee’s rate of pay.</p>\n<p>6.     The employee will be paid the donated time through the regular biweekly pay process, and therefore will be paid a maximum of 75 hours per pay period depending on his/her regular schedule.</p>\n<p><em>Example:</em> An employee makes application for one week’s amount of SLR and is approved for funding. The applicant makes $8.00/hour and works a 37.5 hour workweek. This translates into a maximum of $300/week that can be requested per week. The donor makes $12.00/hour and works a 37.5 hour workweek. This translates into a donation of $450 for one week’s worth of CTO. Upon distribution of the donated time, the approved applicant will receive $300 while the MLAF will contain a balance of $150 to be used in the future by other approved applicants. The remaining amount will not be re-deposited into the donor’s CTO account.</p>\n<p>7.     If no donations are made and there is no balance in the fund, the applicant will not receive any payment. If partial funding of the approved applicant’s request can be made, it will be paid. The remainder cannot be made up in a future payment.</p>\n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #660000;\">D. Donation to the fund</span></strong></h4>\n<p>An employee who has a minimum of 80 hours of CTO and/or SLR may make a maximum contribution of 10 hours of <strong>CTO</strong> to the MLA fund. This is done by completing the Donor form and sending it to the Manager of Human Resources. SLR and/or CTO hours cannot be donated to the Medical Leave Assistance Fund upon notification of termination of employment.</p>\n<p><strong>D.3.g. Social Security &#x26; Medicare (FICA)</strong></p>\n<p>In compliance with the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), the Institute contributes one-half of the total tax prescribed by law, and each employee contributes one-half through payroll deductions. Social Security provides retirement benefits, disability benefits, life insurance/survivor benefits, and medical insurance. Please direct all questions concerning social security coverage to the local offices of the Social Security Administration.</p>\n<p><strong>D.3.h. Insurance Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>Regular staff members who normally are scheduled, and who work 20 hours or more per week, are eligible for enrollment in the Institute’s medical, dental, vision, long-term disability, and life insurance programs.</p>\n<p>Coverage is effective the first day of the month coinciding with or following the date of employment. The enrollment period is for 30 days from the date of eligibility.</p>\n<p>Institute Employees participate in the Middlebury College Health and Welfare Benefits plans. For details about eligibility and coverage, please see the Summary Plan Descriptions for each benefit program, provided to each eligible employee and available from the Human Resources Office.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>A. Medical Insurance</strong></span></h4>\n<p>The Institute currently provides a comprehensive medical insurance plan for employees and their eligible dependents. The employee’s contribution, determined by the President and approved by the Board of Trustees, will be deducted each pay period for the elected coverage.</p>\n<p>Dependent coverage, which is substantially subsidized by the Institute at this time, is available at the employee’s option. The employee contribution for dependent coverage is paid through payroll deduction.</p>\n<p>In the event of an increase in medical insurance premium rates, employees may be required to contribute to the cost of increased premiums to retain coverage. Notice of such increases will be made to employees as they occur.</p>\n<p>When employees terminate employment (and under certain other circumstances), except in cases of gross misconduct, they have the option of continuing insurance benefits at their own cost plus a minor administration fee, as provided by the federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). Specific information on COBRA can be obtained from Human Resources, and will be provided when employees enroll in the benefits plans and when they end qualifying employment at the Institute.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>B. Dental and Vision Insurance</strong></span></h4>\n<p>The Institute currently provides dental and vision insurance plans for qualified employees and their eligible dependents. Dependent coverage is at the employee’s option and expense, and is paid through payroll deduction. Please refer to the applicable Summary Plan Description, available from the Human Resources Office, for details of the plans.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>C. Long-Term Disability Insurance</strong></span></h4>\n<p>The Institute currently provides a long-term disability (LTD) insurance plan for qualified employees. LTD insurance provides partial income replacement for long-term absence when an employee is totally disabled. Please refer to the Summary Plan Description, available from the Human Resources Office, for details of the plan.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>D. Life Insurance</strong></span></h4>\n<p>The Institute currently provides a life insurance plan for qualified employees. Benefit level is determined by base salary. Please contact the Human Resources Office for details of the plan.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>E. Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance</strong></span></h4>\n<p>The Institute currently offers Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance (AD&#x26;D) for qualified employees and their eligible dependents. Employees pay the full premium for this optional coverage through payroll deduction. Contact the Human Resources Office for details of the plan.</p>\n<p><strong>D.3. i. Literacy Education</strong></p>\n<p>California Labor Code Sections 1040-1044 require employers to reasonably accommodate and assist employees in need of literacy education. Institute employees wishing to improve their literacy should contact Human Resources. The Institute itself does not offer literacy education, but Human Resources can provide assistance in the following ways:</p>\n<p>• helping employees enroll in adult literacy education programs;</p>\n<p>• arranging for literacy education providers to visit the Institute; or</p>\n<p>• providing contact information for local literacy education programs.</p>\n<p>The Institute will attempt to assist the employee if the accommodation requested would not result in an undue hardship. The Institute does not provide paid time-off for participation in such programs.</p>\n<p><strong>D.3.j. Employee and Family Assistance Program</strong></p>\n<p>The employee assistance program, provided through E4, helps employees and their family members with personal problems. It is available at no cost to all Institute employees and their family members. Employee assistance is confidential; when an employee or family member contacts the program, the employee’s supervisor will not be informed. The goal of the program is to assist staff members to resolve personal problems before they adversely affect an employee’s ability to perform her/his job effectively. For more information go to the <a href=\"https://www.helloe4.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.helloe4.com%2F&#x26;reauth=1\">e4Health</a> website.</p>\n<p><strong>D.3.k. Retirement Plan</strong></p>\n<p>The Middlebury College retirement program includes 401(a), 403(b), and 457(b) plans, all of which are administered by TIAA-CREF.  The plans are designed to offer various advantages to eligible employees, such as a generous employer contribution, tax advantages, and retirement, death, and disability benefits. For information regarding eligibility, contributions, benefits and tax status, contact the Human Resources Office. As a condition of employment, eligible employees are required to participate in the 401(a) plan (called the “Core Retirement Plan”). Employees who are not eligible to participate in the group retirement plan, and who wish to contribute to an individual plan available through payroll deduction, should contact the Human Resources Office for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>D.3.l. State Disability Insurance (SDI)</strong></p>\n<p>Each employee, except those who claim valid exemption, currently contributes to the State of California to provide disability insurance pursuant to the California Unemployment Insurance Code. Contributions are made through a payroll deduction. Coverage begins with the first day of employment and applies without regard to the number of hours worked per day or length of contract.</p>\n<p>Disability insurance is payable when an employee cannot work because of illness or injury not caused by employment at the Institute or when an employee is entitled to temporary workers’ compensation at a rate less than the daily disability benefit amount.</p>\n<p>Unemployment insurance and disability insurance benefits cannot be paid for the same period.</p>\n<p>It is Institute policy to integrate SDI payments with salary continuance payments for covered disabilities (see sick leave policy). Specific rules and regulations governing disability are available from the Human Resources Office.</p>\n<p><strong>D.3.m. Flexible spending accounts</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes referred to as a cafeteria plan, flex plan, or a Section 125 plan, a Flexible Benefits Plan lets you set aside a certain amount of your paycheck into an account before paying income taxes. During the year you have access to this account for reimbursement of expenses you regularly pay, such as health-care and dependent daycare. When you use tax-free dollars to pay for these expenses, you realize an increase in your spending power and substantial tax savings.</p>\n<p>Additional information about options and limitations is available in the HR office.</p>\n<p><strong>D.3.n. Employee Educational Assistance</strong></p>\n<p>After one year of benefits-qualifying employment, full-time employees and part-time benefits-eligible employees may register tuition-free for one Institute course or four units, whichever is greater, per term or semester. A tuition credit form, available from the Human Resources Office, must be completed and signed by the employee and his/her supervisor,  and by representatives of the registrar’s, cashier’s and HR offices. If the course is scheduled during normal working hours of a non-exempt staff member, an amended work schedule for the semester or duration of the course must be submitted for the file in the Human Resources Office.</p>\n<p>Tuition benefits above $5,250 are taxable, and taxes will be withheld from employee’s pay during the semester of attendance, as required by the IRS.</p>\n<p><strong>D.3.o. Educational Assistance for Dependents of Employees</strong></p>\n<p>After one year of qualifying employment, a full time employee’s dependents may register for up to and including a full load of courses free of tuition. Dependents include spouses; domestic partners; and dependent children as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of the United States. Dependents of part-time staff are not eligible for tuition credit. A tuition credit form, available from the Human Resources Office, must be completed and signed by the employee and by representatives of the registrar, cashier and HR offices.</p>\n<p>The services of the Custom Language Services (CLS) are not included in this benefit.</p>\n<p>If an employee uses this benefit for an eligible dependent, that dependent may not also, in the same semester, receive a merit scholarship from the Middlebury Institute. The employee and his/her dependent must choose between using the benefit and accepting a scholarship.</p>\n<p>This is a taxable benefit, and taxes will be withheld from the employee’s pay during the semester of attendance, as required by the IRS. Please consult with HR to assess the financial implications of accepting this benefit.</p>\n<p>Questions about merit scholarships should be addressed to the office of enrollment management.  Other questions having to do with student financing should be addressed to the office of financial aid.</p>\n<p><strong>D.3.p. Unemployment Compensation</strong></p>\n<p>The Institute currently contributes as required to the California Unemployment Insurance Fund on behalf of its employees. Coverage begins with the first day of employment and applies without regard to the number of hours worked per day or length of contract. For further information, contact the Human Resources Office.</p>\n<p><strong>D.3.q. Workers' Compensation</strong></p>\n<p>Employees are currently protected by the Institute's workers' compensation insurance policy while employed at the Institute, at no cost to the employee. The policy covers an employee in case of occupational injury or illness. Coverage begins with the first day of employment and applies without regard to the number of hours worked per day or length of contract. Benefits may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>payment of all medical expenses related to the accident or illness,</li>\n<li>weekly payments, tax-free, based on Institute salary to partially cover lost wages, and</li>\n<li>vocational rehabilitation to help qualified injured employees return to suitable employment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since workers' compensation payments are less than normal salary, an employee may elect to use part of her/his sick leave reserve and CTO accrual in addition to the workers' compensation payment in an effort to maintain full salary during the time off work.</p>\n<p>If an employee is injured on the job, s/he must notify her/his supervisor and the Human Resources Office immediately. If medical treatment is needed, Human Resources staff will assist with arranging appropriate medical care. If an employee has sustained a serious injury, someone nearby should call 911 for emergency medical care and then inform the supervisor and the Human Resources Office.</p>\n<p>If an employee wishes to be treated by her/his personal physician in the case of a work-related injury, the employee should make sure that the Human Resources office is aware of this ahead of time by making the request in writing. The request will be placed on file in the Human Resources Office.</p>\n<p>After an employee has received medical care, s/he must provide the Human Resources Office and her/his supervisor certification from her/his health care provider regarding the need for workers' compensation disability leave (if any) and her/his ability to return to work from the leave.</p>\n<p>The Institute or its insurer will not be liable for the payment of workers' compensation benefits for any injury that arises out of voluntary participation in any off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity that is not part of work-related duties.</p>\n<p>The law requires that the Institute notify the workers' compensation insurance company of any concerns of false or fraudulent claims. Any person who makes or causes to be made any knowingly false or fraudulent material statement or material misrepresentation for the purpose of obtaining or denying workers' compensation benefits or payments is guilty of a felony.</p>\n<p>For further information, please contact the Human Resources Office.</p>\n<p><strong>D.3.r. Paid Family Leave</strong></p>\n<p>Employees may be eligible for up to six weeks of state-provided paid family leave (PFL) insurance benefits when they take time off for one of the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To bond with a child during the first 12 months after the child's birth or placement for adoption or foster care with the employee; or</li>\n<li>To care for an immediate family member (spouse, registered domestic partner, child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling and parent-in-law as defined by the PFL law) who is seriously ill and requires care.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The PFL benefits described in this policy are a state-provided partial wage replacement benefit, not a protected leave of absence. To obtain approval for a leave of absence for the reasons set forth above, employees must contact Human Resources and comply with applicable eligibility, notice and certification requirements when required by state or federal law.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>A. Amount and Duration of Benefits</strong></span> </h4>\n<p>The weekly benefit amount is generally 60 or 70 percent of the employee's earnings (depending upon the employee's income), with benefits capped at a state-imposed maximum weekly benefit amount. Employees may receive up to six weeks of PFL benefits during a 12-month period, but may not receive more benefits than earned in wages during the base period for calculating benefits (generally, the 12 months prior to the quarter in which the claim is made).</p>\n<p>When applicable, PFL benefits will run concurrently with leave time available under the California Family Rights Act and the federal Family and Medical Leave Act. Employees may use any accrued but unused sick leave prior to receiving PFL benefits. Employees are required to use any accrued but unused CTO, up to a maximum of two weeks prior to receiving PFL benefits. Employees may choose to use accrued but unused paid time in excess of two weeks.</p>\n<p>Employees should inform Human Resources as soon as they become aware of circumstances that may trigger eligibility for benefits under any of these programs. Although these programs are funded and run by the state and all eligibility and benefit decisions are made by the state agencies involved, not by the Institute, Human Resources will assist you in obtaining additional information about these programs.</p>"},"bdde981c-0c42-5438-9e47-c28e44a45011":{"id":"bdde981c-0c42-5438-9e47-c28e44a45011","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/d-employee-handbook/d-4-employee-conduct","title":"D.4.

Code of Conduct for Employees**\n\nThe success of the Institute depends not only on the competence of its faculty and staff, but also upon its reputation for honesty, integrity, and lack of bias in conducting its affairs.  This Code of Conduct identifies basic policy and standards concerning ethical conduct and provides guidance in several areas of specific concern.  Each employee of the Institute is expected to adhere to these standards of conduct.\n\nOther expectations for the Middlebury Institute faculty and staff are covered in other sections of the Employee Handbook.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**A. General Principles**</span>\n\nInstitute faculty and staff should conduct themselves ethically, honestly, and with integrity in all dealings.  They need to be fair and principled in their official interactions and to act in good faith in these matters with others both within and outside the Institute community.  They should act with due recognition of their position of trust and loyalty with respect to the Institute and its students, fellow employees, research sponsors, and donors.  When in doubt about the propriety of a proposed course of action, they should seek counsel from those colleagues, supervisors, or administrators who can assist in determining the right and appropriate course of conduct.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**B. Proper Use of Institute Property and Funds**</span>\n\nInstitute faculty and staff must see to it that Institute resources are not used for other than their intended purposes.  Institute employees have an obligation to manage the Institute’s resources prudently, with a responsibility to those who provide those resources, including students, parents, alumni, foundations, other donors, and government agencies.  Faculty and staff are responsible for safeguarding the tangible and intangible assets of the Institute that are under their control.  Institute resources may not be converted to personal use, either for oneself or another person.  Institute funds may not be used to make contributions to candidates for public office, to political parties, or to other political organizations that are organized and operated primarily to accept contributions and make expenditures for the purpose of influencing the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to federal, state, or local public office or office in a political organization, or the election of Presidential electors.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**C. Accuracy of Records and Reporting**</span>\n\nThe records, data, and information owned, used, and managed by the Institute must be accurate and complete.  The accuracy and reliability of financial reports is of the utmost importance to the business operations of the Institute.  Faculty and staff must record, allocate, and charge costs accurately and maintain supporting documentation as required by established policies and procedures.  All reports, vouchers, bills, invoices, payroll information, personnel records, and other essential business records must be prepared with care and honesty.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**D. Grants and Contracts**</span>\n\nMembers of the faculty and staff requesting funding from government agencies, corporations, foundations, and other granting organizations have an affirmative obligation to make full, accurate, and honest representations concerning all relevant information submitted to or requested by the granting organization.  Accurate and complete records, including supporting documentation as required by the granting organization, of the uses to which grant funds are put must be maintained.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**E. Confidential Information**</span>\n\nMembers of the faculty and staff may be privy to confidential information in the course of their daily work.  This information may relate to, among others, students, parents, alumni, donors, employees, and candidates for positions on the faculty or staff.  All Institute employees must safeguard confidential information.  This includes insuring that confidential documents, in either paper or electronic form, are not left unattended; refraining from engaging in discussion of confidential information in forums where the information may be overheard; and protecting the privacy of past and present students, faculty, and staff by maintaining the confidentiality of student and employee records.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**F. Conflicts of Interest**</span>\n\nMembers of the faculty and staff should avoid improper conflicts of interest that might compromise the integrity and objectivity of the Institute.  Examples of situations involving potential conflicts of interest include working for the Institute as an outside vendor; using information that the Institute considers privileged or confidential for the benefit of a person or entity outside the Institute; utilizing discounts allowed to the Institute for personal gain; and soliciting for oneself or for a third party anything of value from any person or entity in return for any business or service provided by the Institute.\n\nFinancial conflicts of interest (for example, an employee's participating in the ownership or management of an entity that regularly does business with the Institute) should be disclosed, reviewed, and appropriately managed or eliminated.  No member of the faculty or staff may approve, recommend, or promote a business transaction with a firm in which that person is an officer or senior management employee, or holds more than a 5 percent equity interest, unless such person first discloses in writing the business relationship and the circumstances of the contemplated activity to the Senior Director, Middlebury Business Information Systems/MIIS Operations.\n\nNo member of the faculty and staff shall solicit anything of value in return for influencing or exercising his or her discretion in a particular way on an Institute matter.  Faculty and staff should not accept any material gift, gratuity, or other payment, in cash or in kind, from a vendor currently doing business with the Institute or seeking to do so.  Members of the faculty and staff may not solicit or receive discounts or rebates on goods and services offered to them in their private capacity by vendors to the Institute that exceed those generally available to other customers. Exceptions to this general provision include unsolicited gifts of a nominal value given at holidays, birthdays, weddings, and other commonly recognized social occasions.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**G. Antitrust**</span>\n\nMembers of the faculty and staff may not improperly collude with other entities, including other colleges and universities, in matters affecting the financial or administrative decisions of the Institute.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**H. Compliance with Laws and Regulations**</span>\n\nMembers of the faculty and staff are expected to transact Institute business in compliance with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to their positions and areas of responsibility, including, but not limited to, equal employment opportunity, fair employment practices, and nondiscrimination laws; laws regarding the privacy and confidentiality of employee and student records; and laws regarding workplace safety, workplace policies and regulations, and occupational health.  Members of the faculty and staff whose programs operate internationally are expected to comply with the laws of the nations in which those programs operate, including foreign corrupt practices acts.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**I. Obligation to Report Suspected Violations**</span>\n\nFaculty and staff are obligated to report suspected violations of these standards promptly to their supervisor, department chair, the Manager of Human Resources or the VP for Human Resources and Chief Risk Officer.  A supervisor or department chair to whom a report of a violation is made is obligated to follow up the report with the appropriate administrative authority.  In investigating claims of inappropriate activities, care will be taken to maintain confidentiality.  The Middlebury Institute will protect from retaliation anyone who makes a good faith effort to appropriately disclose perceived wrongdoing.  However, the Institute reserves the right to distinguish between retaliation and ongoing performance management related to the \"whistleblower.\" Employees who feel that they have been subject to retaliation as a result of compliance with this policy should communicate their concerns to Human Resources.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**J. Consequences of Violation**</span>\n\nMaterial violations of this code or related Institute policies and procedures will be considered under the Institute's established disciplinary practices and procedures for members of the faculty and staff and may carry disciplinary consequences, up to and including dismissal from employment.  Such violations may also subject individuals to civil or criminal actions in state or federal courts.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**K. Supervisor's Obligations**</span>\n\nIndividuals who supervise others should ensure that their direct reports have received adequate instruction and explanation with respect to their obligations under this code.\n\n**D.4.c. Other Prohibited Conduct**\n\nThe Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey expects satisfactory job performance and appropriate professional conduct of every employee. The Institute also considers these to be important factors in retention, promotion, and salary decisions.\n\nIn addition to the expectation of high ethical standards as defined in the Code of Conduct, employees are expected to be polite, courteous, prompt, and attentive in their dealings with colleagues, students and members of the public, and to avoid conduct injurious to security, personal safety, employee welfare, and the Institute's operations.\n\nProhibited conduct includes but is not limited to:\n\n- Possession, distribution, sale, use, or being under the influence of alcoholic beverages or illegal drugs while on Institute property, while on duty, or while operating a vehicle or potentially dangerous equipment leased or owned by the Institute.\n- Breach of confidentiality.\n- Falsification of employment records, employment information, time reports, or other Institute records.\n- Unsatisfactory performance or conduct.\n- Theft, deliberate or careless damage or destruction of any Institute property, or the property of any employee, student, or customer.\n- Removing or borrowing Institute property without prior authorization.\n- Unauthorized use of Institute equipment (including computer systems and software), time, materials, or facilities.\n- Provoking a fight or fighting during working hours or on Institute property.\n- Carrying firearms or any other dangerous weapons on Institute premises, including parking lots, at any time.\n- Engaging in criminal conduct, whether or not related to job performance.\n- Causing, creating, or participating in a disruption of any kind during working hours on Institute property.\n- Insubordination, including but not limited to failure or refusal to follow the orders or instructions of a supervisor or a member of management, or the use of abusive or threatening language toward a supervisor or member of management.\n- Threatening, intimidating, coercing, harassing, or interfering with other employees.\n- Violating the Middlebury Anti-Harassment/Discrimination and/or Sexual Misconduct policies.\n- Failure to work cooperatively with others.\n- Failure to notify a supervisor when unable to report to work, unless a reasonable excuse is offered and accepted by the Institute.\n- Excessive absenteeism.\n- Unreported absence of three (3) consecutive scheduled workdays, unless a reasonable excuse is offered and accepted by the Institute.\n- Failure to observe working schedules, including rest and lunch periods.\n- Leaving the job during working hours without permission.\n- Failure to provide a physician's certificate when requested or required to do so.\n- Sleeping or loitering on the job.\n- Conducting excessive personal business on Institute time.\n- Working overtime without authorization or refusing to work assigned overtime.\n- Violation of any safety, health, security, or Institute policies, procedures, or mandates.\n- Violation of Human Resources policies and procedures.\n- Failure to cooperate in an investigation.\n- Committing a fraudulent act or a breach of trust under any circumstances.\n- Attempting any of the above actions.\n\nInstitute action in a particular case might depend on its judgment or consideration of, among other things,\n\n- the severity of the conduct,\n- the circumstances surrounding the matter,\n- the past employment record of the employee, and\n- the needs of the Institute.\n\nIt should be remembered that employment is for an unspecified term and is at the mutual consent of the employee and the Institute. Consequently, the employment relationship can be terminated at will, at any time, either by the employee or the Institute, with or without cause or notice.\n\n**D.4.d. Personal Business, Telephone Use, and Personal Mail**\n\nWe recognize that there are times when a staff employee may need to conduct personal business while in the office, such as scheduling an appointment or checking with a family member. We expect that employees will keep these times to a minimum and that they will plan personal business to impact their time at work as little as possible. If an employee incurs charges for long-distance calls, personal photocopies, personal mail, etc., the employee is responsible for reimbursing the Institute for these charges.\n\nStaff employees are not permitted to conduct business for another employer during scheduled working hours.\n\n**D.4.e. Employer Property**\n\nDesks, vehicles, and other Institute property and equipment must be maintained according to Institute rules and regulations. Institute property is to be used only for work-related purposes. The Institute reserves the right to inspect its property to ensure compliance with its rules and regulations, without notice to the employee and at any time, not necessarily in the employee’s presence.\n\nPrior authorization must be obtained before any Institute property may be removed from the premises.\n\nTerminated employees should remove any personal items at the time they leave the Institute. Personal items left in the workplace are subject to disposal if not claimed at the time of an employee’s termination.\n\n**D.4.f. Housekeeping**\n\nAll employees are expected to keep their work areas clean and organized. People using common areas such as lunchrooms, locker rooms, and restrooms are expected to keep them sanitary.\n\n**D.4.g. Confidentiality**\n\nThe protection of confidential information is vital to the interests and success of the Institute. Such confidential information includes, but is not limited to, the following examples:\n\n- Compensation data\n- Donor information\n- Employee personal information\n- Student records and information\n- Financial information\n- Marketing strategies\n- Pending projects and proposals\n- Research and development strategies\n\nAny employee who misappropriates for her/his own use or discloses confidential information to other persons or organizations will be subject to disciplinary action (up to and including discharge) and legal action, even if s/he does not actually benefit from the disclosed information.\n\nConfidential information may be exchanged among Institute employees on a need to know basis in connection with official responsibilities. If an employee has any uncertainty as to whether someone is authorized to receive certain confidential information, the employee should contact her/his supervisor to discuss the matter before any such disclosure is made.\n\nSince it can be difficult to distinguish legitimate inquiries from invasions of others' privacy, no information about an employee is to be divulged in response to outside inquiries without proper authorization. Refer verification of employment inquiries to the Human Resources Office. Human Resources will verify employment, job title(s), and dates of employment, and additional information authorized by the employee, if the employee completes an Information Release Waiver. This form is available from, and must be completed and filed with the Human Resources Office. HR will also verify employment information if it receives a written request accompanied by a waiver prepared by the requestor and signed by the employee. Specific references will not be provided without a completed Information Release Waiver.\n\nAll other requests for information (i.e. those involving private attorneys, or state or federal agency representatives) should be directed to Human Resources.\n\n**D.4.h. Conflicts of Interest and Supervision of Related Individuals**\n\nIt is the Institute's policy not to discriminate against an individual because of that individual's marital status, because the individual may be related to another Institute employee, or because of any legal off-duty conduct of employees that does not bear on the fitness for duty of the employee and/or does not affect adversely the interests or reputation of the Institute. However, the Institute reserves the right to take appropriate action if familial or personal relationships between employees interfere with the safety, security, or morale at the Institute or create actual or apparent conflicts of interest.\n\nFor example, relatives of employees may be ineligible for employment positions with the Institute if the related employee works in a direct supervisory relationship or in job positions in which a conflict of interest could arise.\n\n\"Relatives\" include spouses, domestic partners, children, siblings, parents, grandparents, in-laws, and step-relatives. Employees who become spouses or domestic partners of each other will be permitted to continue working in the positions held only if they do not work in direct supervisory relationship with one another or in job positions involving conflict of interest.\n\nConflicts of interest may include initiating and/or participating in, directly or indirectly, decisions involving a direct benefit (e.g. initial employment or appointment, retention, promotion, evaluation, salary, work assignments, research funds, leave of absences, etc.) to members of the employee’s immediate family.\n\nIn general terms, a conflict of interest exists when an employee or a member of the employee's immediate family has a personal or financial interest in a person or company dealing with the Institute which is of such a nature that it might affect or appear to affect decisions made on behalf of the Institute. It is a serious violation of trust if the interests of the Institute are subordinated in the course of performing professional duties. If there is any doubt as to the propriety of an existing or planned relationship, which could create, or appear to create, a conflict of interest, an employee should consult her/his supervisor or the Manager of Human Resources.\n\nNo employee may conduct Institute business with a person with whom s/he is related, or with a business organization with which the employee or related individual has a significant association, without first having the written approval of the Manager of Human Resources.\n\nNo employee or any member of her/his household shall accept gifts or gratuities or other favored treatment from any person associated with a present or prospective customer, competitor, or supplier of the Institute. Routine gifts of nominal value (i.e., advertising novelties or holiday gifts) are generally acceptable and should be shared with fellow employees. Similarly, no employee may give money or gifts of significant value to a customer, competitor, or supplier if it could be reasonably viewed as being done to gain an unfair advantage.\n\n**D.4.i. Technology Policies**\n\nIn matters pertaining to privacy, security, and responsible use of computing facilities, Institute faculty, staff and students are subject to Middlebury Library and Information Services policies.\n\nIn particular, the following policies related to shared resources, as described in the [**Middlebury Handbook**](/pages/i-policies-for-all/appropriate-use/info-tech), apply to Middlebury Institute faculty, staff, and students:\n\n- [Responsible Use of Computing and Network Services and Facilities](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/technology/its/policies/responsible-use)\n- [Network Monitoring Policy](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/technology/its/policies/netmon)\n- [Password Policy](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/technology/its/policies/passwords)\n- [Privacy and Security of Files, Data and Communications](/pages/i-policies-for-all/appropriate-use/info-tech)\n\n**D.4.j. Dress Code and Other Personal Standards**\n\nEmployees are expected to wear clothing appropriate for the nature of the type of work performed and reflecting a high standard of professionalism. Employees should avoid clothing that can create a safety hazard or that restricts their ability to perform work. Supervisors will inform employees of any additional requirements regarding acceptable attire. In consideration of professional image, as well as in consideration of colleagues, good habits of grooming and personal hygiene are expected.\n\n**D.4.k. Media Contacts**\n\nOn occasion, employees may be approached for interviews or comments by the news media. Only contact people designated by the VPAA may comment on Institute policy or events that have an impact on the Institute. Any questions regarding this policy should be directed to the director of communications.\n\n**D.4.l. Punctuality and Attendance**\n\nWhile absences may be unavoidable for some acceptable reasons, attendance is an important factor in judging a staff employee's value to the Institute. Regular, quality attendance is an essential function of all faculty and staff positions.\n\nStaff employees are expected to report to work as scheduled, on time and prepared to start work. Late arrival, early departure, or other absences from scheduled hours are disruptive and should be avoided. If an employee is unable to report for work on any particular day due to illness or emergency, s/he must call her/his supervisor before or at the time he or she is scheduled to begin work. In all cases of absence or tardiness, it is expected that an employee will provide her/his supervisor an accurate reason or explanation.\n\nExcessive and repeated absences, early departure from the employee's work station and/or tardiness is cause for termination. Tardiness is defined as being away from the assigned workstation at the start of the workday or being late in returning from an allotted rest or meal period.\n\n**D.4.m. Supplementary Employment (\"Moonlighting\")**\n\nWhile the Institute does not seek to interfere with the off-duty and personal conduct of its staff employees, certain types of off-duty conduct may interfere with the Institute's legitimate business interests. While employed by the Institute, full time staff employees are expected to devote their energies to their jobs with the Institute. Other employment that conflicts with work schedule, duties, and responsibilities, or that impairs work performance with the Institute is not acceptable. The hours and expectations of the job at the Institute will not be altered to accommodate supplemental employment.\n","excerpt":"D.4.a.

Consequences of Violation</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Material violations of this code or related Institute policies and procedures will be considered under the Institute's established disciplinary practices and procedures for members of the faculty and staff and may carry disciplinary consequences, up to and including dismissal from employment.  Such violations may also subject individuals to civil or criminal actions in state or federal courts.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>K. Supervisor's Obligations</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Individuals who supervise others should ensure that their direct reports have received adequate instruction and explanation with respect to their obligations under this code.</p>\n<p><strong>D.4.c. Other Prohibited Conduct</strong></p>\n<p>The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey expects satisfactory job performance and appropriate professional conduct of every employee. The Institute also considers these to be important factors in retention, promotion, and salary decisions.</p>\n<p>In addition to the expectation of high ethical standards as defined in the Code of Conduct, employees are expected to be polite, courteous, prompt, and attentive in their dealings with colleagues, students and members of the public, and to avoid conduct injurious to security, personal safety, employee welfare, and the Institute's operations.</p>\n<p>Prohibited conduct includes but is not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Possession, distribution, sale, use, or being under the influence of alcoholic beverages or illegal drugs while on Institute property, while on duty, or while operating a vehicle or potentially dangerous equipment leased or owned by the Institute.</li>\n<li>Breach of confidentiality.</li>\n<li>Falsification of employment records, employment information, time reports, or other Institute records.</li>\n<li>Unsatisfactory performance or conduct.</li>\n<li>Theft, deliberate or careless damage or destruction of any Institute property, or the property of any employee, student, or customer.</li>\n<li>Removing or borrowing Institute property without prior authorization.</li>\n<li>Unauthorized use of Institute equipment (including computer systems and software), time, materials, or facilities.</li>\n<li>Provoking a fight or fighting during working hours or on Institute property.</li>\n<li>Carrying firearms or any other dangerous weapons on Institute premises, including parking lots, at any time.</li>\n<li>Engaging in criminal conduct, whether or not related to job performance.</li>\n<li>Causing, creating, or participating in a disruption of any kind during working hours on Institute property.</li>\n<li>Insubordination, including but not limited to failure or refusal to follow the orders or instructions of a supervisor or a member of management, or the use of abusive or threatening language toward a supervisor or member of management.</li>\n<li>Threatening, intimidating, coercing, harassing, or interfering with other employees.</li>\n<li>Violating the Middlebury Anti-Harassment/Discrimination and/or Sexual Misconduct policies.</li>\n<li>Failure to work cooperatively with others.</li>\n<li>Failure to notify a supervisor when unable to report to work, unless a reasonable excuse is offered and accepted by the Institute.</li>\n<li>Excessive absenteeism.</li>\n<li>Unreported absence of three (3) consecutive scheduled workdays, unless a reasonable excuse is offered and accepted by the Institute.</li>\n<li>Failure to observe working schedules, including rest and lunch periods.</li>\n<li>Leaving the job during working hours without permission.</li>\n<li>Failure to provide a physician's certificate when requested or required to do so.</li>\n<li>Sleeping or loitering on the job.</li>\n<li>Conducting excessive personal business on Institute time.</li>\n<li>Working overtime without authorization or refusing to work assigned overtime.</li>\n<li>Violation of any safety, health, security, or Institute policies, procedures, or mandates.</li>\n<li>Violation of Human Resources policies and procedures.</li>\n<li>Failure to cooperate in an investigation.</li>\n<li>Committing a fraudulent act or a breach of trust under any circumstances.</li>\n<li>Attempting any of the above actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Institute action in a particular case might depend on its judgment or consideration of, among other things,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the severity of the conduct,</li>\n<li>the circumstances surrounding the matter,</li>\n<li>the past employment record of the employee, and</li>\n<li>the needs of the Institute.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It should be remembered that employment is for an unspecified term and is at the mutual consent of the employee and the Institute. Consequently, the employment relationship can be terminated at will, at any time, either by the employee or the Institute, with or without cause or notice.</p>\n<p><strong>D.4.d. Personal Business, Telephone Use, and Personal Mail</strong></p>\n<p>We recognize that there are times when a staff employee may need to conduct personal business while in the office, such as scheduling an appointment or checking with a family member. We expect that employees will keep these times to a minimum and that they will plan personal business to impact their time at work as little as possible. If an employee incurs charges for long-distance calls, personal photocopies, personal mail, etc., the employee is responsible for reimbursing the Institute for these charges.</p>\n<p>Staff employees are not permitted to conduct business for another employer during scheduled working hours.</p>\n<p><strong>D.4.e. Employer Property</strong></p>\n<p>Desks, vehicles, and other Institute property and equipment must be maintained according to Institute rules and regulations. Institute property is to be used only for work-related purposes. The Institute reserves the right to inspect its property to ensure compliance with its rules and regulations, without notice to the employee and at any time, not necessarily in the employee’s presence.</p>\n<p>Prior authorization must be obtained before any Institute property may be removed from the premises.</p>\n<p>Terminated employees should remove any personal items at the time they leave the Institute. Personal items left in the workplace are subject to disposal if not claimed at the time of an employee’s termination.</p>\n<p><strong>D.4.f. Housekeeping</strong></p>\n<p>All employees are expected to keep their work areas clean and organized. People using common areas such as lunchrooms, locker rooms, and restrooms are expected to keep them sanitary.</p>\n<p><strong>D.4.g. Confidentiality</strong></p>\n<p>The protection of confidential information is vital to the interests and success of the Institute. Such confidential information includes, but is not limited to, the following examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compensation data</li>\n<li>Donor information</li>\n<li>Employee personal information</li>\n<li>Student records and information</li>\n<li>Financial information</li>\n<li>Marketing strategies</li>\n<li>Pending projects and proposals</li>\n<li>Research and development strategies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any employee who misappropriates for her/his own use or discloses confidential information to other persons or organizations will be subject to disciplinary action (up to and including discharge) and legal action, even if s/he does not actually benefit from the disclosed information.</p>\n<p>Confidential information may be exchanged among Institute employees on a need to know basis in connection with official responsibilities. If an employee has any uncertainty as to whether someone is authorized to receive certain confidential information, the employee should contact her/his supervisor to discuss the matter before any such disclosure is made.</p>\n<p>Since it can be difficult to distinguish legitimate inquiries from invasions of others' privacy, no information about an employee is to be divulged in response to outside inquiries without proper authorization. Refer verification of employment inquiries to the Human Resources Office. Human Resources will verify employment, job title(s), and dates of employment, and additional information authorized by the employee, if the employee completes an Information Release Waiver. This form is available from, and must be completed and filed with the Human Resources Office. HR will also verify employment information if it receives a written request accompanied by a waiver prepared by the requestor and signed by the employee. Specific references will not be provided without a completed Information Release Waiver.</p>\n<p>All other requests for information (i.e. those involving private attorneys, or state or federal agency representatives) should be directed to Human Resources.</p>\n<p><strong>D.4.h. Conflicts of Interest and Supervision of Related Individuals</strong></p>\n<p>It is the Institute's policy not to discriminate against an individual because of that individual's marital status, because the individual may be related to another Institute employee, or because of any legal off-duty conduct of employees that does not bear on the fitness for duty of the employee and/or does not affect adversely the interests or reputation of the Institute. However, the Institute reserves the right to take appropriate action if familial or personal relationships between employees interfere with the safety, security, or morale at the Institute or create actual or apparent conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>For example, relatives of employees may be ineligible for employment positions with the Institute if the related employee works in a direct supervisory relationship or in job positions in which a conflict of interest could arise.</p>\n<p>\"Relatives\" include spouses, domestic partners, children, siblings, parents, grandparents, in-laws, and step-relatives. Employees who become spouses or domestic partners of each other will be permitted to continue working in the positions held only if they do not work in direct supervisory relationship with one another or in job positions involving conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>Conflicts of interest may include initiating and/or participating in, directly or indirectly, decisions involving a direct benefit (e.g. initial employment or appointment, retention, promotion, evaluation, salary, work assignments, research funds, leave of absences, etc.) to members of the employee’s immediate family.</p>\n<p>In general terms, a conflict of interest exists when an employee or a member of the employee's immediate family has a personal or financial interest in a person or company dealing with the Institute which is of such a nature that it might affect or appear to affect decisions made on behalf of the Institute. It is a serious violation of trust if the interests of the Institute are subordinated in the course of performing professional duties. If there is any doubt as to the propriety of an existing or planned relationship, which could create, or appear to create, a conflict of interest, an employee should consult her/his supervisor or the Manager of Human Resources.</p>\n<p>No employee may conduct Institute business with a person with whom s/he is related, or with a business organization with which the employee or related individual has a significant association, without first having the written approval of the Manager of Human Resources.</p>\n<p>No employee or any member of her/his household shall accept gifts or gratuities or other favored treatment from any person associated with a present or prospective customer, competitor, or supplier of the Institute. Routine gifts of nominal value (i.e., advertising novelties or holiday gifts) are generally acceptable and should be shared with fellow employees. Similarly, no employee may give money or gifts of significant value to a customer, competitor, or supplier if it could be reasonably viewed as being done to gain an unfair advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>D.4.i. Technology Policies</strong></p>\n<p>In matters pertaining to privacy, security, and responsible use of computing facilities, Institute faculty, staff and students are subject to Middlebury Library and Information Services policies.</p>\n<p>In particular, the following policies related to shared resources, as described in the <a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/appropriate-use/info-tech\"><strong>Middlebury Handbook</strong></a>, apply to Middlebury Institute faculty, staff, and students:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/technology/its/policies/responsible-use\">Responsible Use of Computing and Network Services and Facilities</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/technology/its/policies/netmon\">Network Monitoring Policy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/technology/its/policies/passwords\">Password Policy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/pages/i-policies-for-all/appropriate-use/info-tech\">Privacy and Security of Files, Data and Communications</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>D.4.j. Dress Code and Other Personal Standards</strong></p>\n<p>Employees are expected to wear clothing appropriate for the nature of the type of work performed and reflecting a high standard of professionalism. Employees should avoid clothing that can create a safety hazard or that restricts their ability to perform work. Supervisors will inform employees of any additional requirements regarding acceptable attire. In consideration of professional image, as well as in consideration of colleagues, good habits of grooming and personal hygiene are expected.</p>\n<p><strong>D.4.k. Media Contacts</strong></p>\n<p>On occasion, employees may be approached for interviews or comments by the news media. Only contact people designated by the VPAA may comment on Institute policy or events that have an impact on the Institute. Any questions regarding this policy should be directed to the director of communications.</p>\n<p><strong>D.4.l. Punctuality and Attendance</strong></p>\n<p>While absences may be unavoidable for some acceptable reasons, attendance is an important factor in judging a staff employee's value to the Institute. Regular, quality attendance is an essential function of all faculty and staff positions.</p>\n<p>Staff employees are expected to report to work as scheduled, on time and prepared to start work. Late arrival, early departure, or other absences from scheduled hours are disruptive and should be avoided. If an employee is unable to report for work on any particular day due to illness or emergency, s/he must call her/his supervisor before or at the time he or she is scheduled to begin work. In all cases of absence or tardiness, it is expected that an employee will provide her/his supervisor an accurate reason or explanation.</p>\n<p>Excessive and repeated absences, early departure from the employee's work station and/or tardiness is cause for termination. Tardiness is defined as being away from the assigned workstation at the start of the workday or being late in returning from an allotted rest or meal period.</p>\n<p><strong>D.4.m. Supplementary Employment (\"Moonlighting\")</strong></p>\n<p>While the Institute does not seek to interfere with the off-duty and personal conduct of its staff employees, certain types of off-duty conduct may interfere with the Institute's legitimate business interests. While employed by the Institute, full time staff employees are expected to devote their energies to their jobs with the Institute. Other employment that conflicts with work schedule, duties, and responsibilities, or that impairs work performance with the Institute is not acceptable. The hours and expectations of the job at the Institute will not be altered to accommodate supplemental employment.</p>"},"8e4cee7c-2339-5b4e-9269-ab5bd8e722aa":{"id":"8e4cee7c-2339-5b4e-9269-ab5bd8e722aa","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/d-employee-handbook/d-5-leaves-of-absence","title":"D.5. Leaves of Absence","body":"\n**D.5\\. a. Family/Medical Leave**\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**A. General Provisions**</span>\n\nThis policy is designed to provide the leaves required by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act and California state law. This policy provides for paid and unpaid family and medical leave under the terms and conditions set forth below. Leaves are available for:\n\n- the birth or adoption or foster care placement (by the state) of a child; or\n- to care for the employee's child, parent, spouse, or domestic partner who has a serious health condition; or\n- a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of her/his job.\n\nThere are special rules that apply only to pregnancy-related disabilities.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**B. Eligibility for Leave**</span>\n\nIn order to qualify for unpaid family and medical leave, other than a\n\npregnancy disability leave, the employee must:\n\n- be employed for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours within the 12-month period prior to making a request for such leave;\n- complete a certification of eligibility.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**C. Family and Medical Leave Definitions**</span>\n\nThe unpaid family and medical leave policy is administered in accordance with the following definitions:\n\n- \"Child\" means biological, adopted, or foster child, a step-child, a legal ward or a child to whom the employee stands _in loco parentis_, who is under the age of 18, or is an adult dependent child, i.e., one who is incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability.\n- \"Spouse\" means the employee's husband or wife as recognized by state law.\n- \"Parent\" means the employee's biological parent or the individual who stood _in loco parentis_ when the employee was a child. It does not include a grandparent or parent-in-law.\n- \"Serious Health Condition\" means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that includes:\n\n1\\. in-patient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; or\n\n2\\. continuing treatment by a health care provider which includes\n\nany period of incapacity due to:\n\n(a) a health condition lasting more than three consecutive days, and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition, that also includes: treatment two or more times by or under the supervision of a health care provider; or one treatment by a health care provider with a continuing regimen of treatment; or\n\n(b) a chronic serious health condition which continues over an extended period of time, requires periodic visits to a health care provider, and may include occasional episodes of incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes). A visit to a health care provider is not necessary for each absence in this category; or\n\n(c) pregnancy-related disabilities (special rules apply); or\n\n(d) a permanent or long-term condition for which treatment may not be effective (e.g., Alzheimer’s, a severe stroke, terminal cancer). Only supervision by a health care provider is required, rather than active treatment; or\n\n(e) any absences to receive multiple treatments for restorative surgery or for a condition which would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three days if not treated (e.g., chemotherapy or radiation treatments for cancer).\n\nA \"serious health condition\" generally will not include conditions like the common cold, the flu, earaches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches (other than migraines), or routine dental problems, unless complications arise.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**D. Duration of Family and Medical Leave**</span>\n\nEmployees may be granted a maximum of 12 weeks of family or medical leave in any 12-month period, unless otherwise required by law. For purposes of determining eligibility, the 12 months will be calculated backward from the date on which the employee first takes family or medical leave.\n\nLeave for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child must be concluded within one year of the birth or placement of the child. If both parents of a child are employed by the Institute and request family care leave to care for a newly arrived child, their aggregate childcare leave is limited to 12 weeks. The time each parent takes off will count against her/his 12-week allotment of family and medical leave. If an employee uses less than 12 weeks to care for a newly arrived child, the remainder of his/her 12 weeks of leave can be used for any permissible FMLA purpose.\n\nIf there is a medical need, leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced work schedule basis to care for a sick family member or for an employee's own serious health condition. If the need for intermittent leave is foreseeable based on a planned medical treatment, the Institute reserves the right to require the employee to temporarily transfer to an equivalent position that can better accommodate the recurring periods of leave.\n\nIntermittent leave for the birth, adoption, or foster care of a child generally must be taken in two-week increments. However, the employee can take childcare leave in increments of less than two weeks on two occasions in connection with each birth, adoption, or placement for foster care.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**E. Notice/Certificates for Family and Medical Leave**</span>\n\nEmployees must give the Institute as much advance notice as possible of the need for family or medical care leave. If the employee knows about the leave more than 30 calendar days before the leave is to commence, the employee must give the Institute at least 30 days written notice. If 30 days notice is not possible, i.e., the need for the leave is not known more than 30 days prior to its commencement, or because there has been a change in circumstances or a medical emergency, the employee must give as much notice as possible.\n\nWhere the employee's need for the leave is for planned medical treatment or supervision, s/he must consult with the Institute to schedule the treatment to minimize the disruption of the Institute's business.\n\nThe employee is required to provide a certificate from the health care provider setting out, among other things, the expected duration of the leave and certifying the condition warrants family or medical care. If the Institute does not receive proper certification prior to commencement of the leave or within 15 calendar days of requesting the certification, the absence from work may be deemed unexcused unless the delay was caused by circumstances truly beyond the employee's control.\n\nThe Institute reserves the right to require a second opinion, at its own expense, regarding the employee's serious health condition. Also, in certain circumstances, recertification by the doctor may be requested.\n\nGenerally, if given advance notice of the need for the leave, the Institute will designate the leave as family and medical leave before the employee goes out on leave. However, the Institute reserves the right to designate a leave as family and medical leave after the leave has begun if it learns of additional facts that allow it to make a determination while the employee is on leave. In addition, the Institute reserves the right to designate the leave as a family and medical leave after the employee returns to work if it does not have sufficient facts on which to make a determination while the employee is out on leave.\n\nIf the Institute does not have sufficient information regarding why an employee is off work, it will inquire as to the reason for the employee's absence. If the employee establishes that the absence is for a family and medical leave or other permissible leave, the time off will be treated consistent with the applicable policy. However, if the employee does not provide the requested information or the information provided is insufficient to establish that the leave is for a purpose covered by the Family and Medical Leave Policy, the leave will be treated as an unexcused absence.\n\nIn order to return to work from a medical leave for the employee's own serous health condition, s/he must submit a release to work certification form her/his health care provider.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**F. Benefits during Family or Medical Leave**</span>\n\nEmployees must take any accrued sick leave reserve as part of any family and medical leave for their own serious health condition, including a pregnancy-related condition. In other circumstances, employees may take any accrued sick leave reserve as part of an unpaid family and medical leave when permitted by the sick leave policy. Employees must take any accrued CTO as part of any unpaid family and medical leave; special rules may apply to pregnancy disability leaves. After all paid leave is exhausted, the remaining period of the leave will be unpaid. Benefit Eligible Employees will continue earn CTO during the unpaid portion of any family or medical leave, but not during an accommodation leave.\n\nWhile taking unpaid family and medical leave, the Institute will continue to provide health benefits, including during pregnancy disability leave and child care leave, under the same terms and conditions as if the employee was still working. The employee will be required to continue paying the employee's portion of any premiums.\n\nEmployees may arrange to pay for their own life insurance premiums and premiums for any other insurance during the unpaid portion of the leave. Coverage will terminate at the end of the last period for which premiums are received.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**G. Reinstatement**</span>\n\nIf an employee returns to work at the end of an unpaid family or medical leave which lasts 12 weeks or less, s/he will be returned to the same position held before the leave or to an equivalent position with the same equivalent pay, benefits, and terms and conditions of employment. Special circumstances apply to pregnancy disabilities.\n\nAn employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the employee had been continuously employed during the unpaid family and medical leave.\n\nIf the employee fails to return to work on the next regularly scheduled workday following the expiration of the leave of absence, her/his employment will be subject to termination.\n\nAll requests for family or medical leave of absences will be administered in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**H. Pregnancy Related Disability Leave**</span>\n\nIn addition to the provisions above, the following policies apply when pregnancy results in a disability.  Pregnancy related disability leave will be designated as leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, but not under the equivalent California statute.\n\n_1\\. Duration of Leave_\n\nIf an employee is disabled because of childbirth, pregnancy, or a related condition, she may take a leave of absence of up to four months with medical verification of the disability. Paid family leave is not available for care of a newborn, but only for the mother's own disability. However, after her doctor releases the employee to work, she may apply for a family care leave to care for her newborn.\n\nThe estimated duration of pregnancy related disability leave is initially determined by the employee and her doctor. To assist in a smooth transition, employees should share this information with the Institute as far in advance as possible.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**I. Transfer Rights**</span>\n\nAn employee who is pregnant is entitled to a transfer from her current position to a less strenuous or hazardous position or duties if:\n\n- the employee provides a certification from her doctor stating less strenuous work is medically advisable; and\n- transfer can be reasonably accommodated by the Institute.\n\nIf it is foreseeable that it would be medically advisable for a pregnant employee to take intermittent leave or work a reduced schedule, the Institute may require the employee to transfer temporarily to an available alternative position that has equivalent pay and benefits, so long as the employee is qualified for the position, and the position better accommodates recurring absences than the employee's regular job.\n\nThe employee will be reinstated to her regular job or a comparable position when the employee's health care provider certifies that there is no further need for less strenuous work, intermittent leave, or a reduced work schedule.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**J. Rights to Reasonable Accommodation**</span>\n\nThe Institute will make a reasonable accommodation for conditions that are related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions if requested by an employee, with the advice of her health care provider, to the extent provided by law.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**K. Benefits During Pregnancy Related Disability Leave**</span>\n\nAn employee must take any accrued sick leave reserve as part of her pregnancy related disability leave. An employee may take any accrued CTO as part of her pregnancy disability leave. After all paid leave is exhausted, the remainder of the employee's pregnancy disability leave will be unpaid.\n\nThe Institute will continue to provide health benefits for an employee on pregnancy related disability under the same terms and conditions as if the employee were still working. The employee will be required to continue paying the employee's portion of any premiums. For policies regarding other benefits, refer to the section of this handbook dealing with benefits during family and medical leave. With respect to all benefits, an employee on paid family leave will be treated no less favorably than employees on other disability related leaves.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**L. Reinstatement After a Pregnancy Related Disability**</span>\n\nIf an employee returns to work at the end of a pregnancy disability of four months or less, she will be reinstated to her former position unless the position no longer exists because of business changes, such as a reduction in force or job abolishment. If the employee's former position does not exist, she will be reinstated to an equivalent position, if one is available.\n\nThe employee will be required to provide the Institute with a fitness for duty certification from her doctor stating she is released to return to work and indicating any work restrictions she may have.\n\nIf the employee fails to return to work at the end of any authorized leave, her employment will be subject to termination, unless she is eligible for another form of leave.\n\n<span>M. Child Care Leave After a Pregnancy Related Disability Leave</span>\n\nAfter the employee is released to return to work from a pregnancy disability, she may request any remaining family and medical leave to care for her newborn, pursuant to the terms of the family and medical leave policy above.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**N. Employee Responsibilities**</span>\n\n- Furnish evidence as requested to substantiate the medical need for disability leave.\n- Notify the Institute in the event the need for or anticipated duration of the leave has changed.\n- Notify supervisor in writing or in person two (2) weeks prior to the expiration of the leave to confirm interest in return to work.\n- Notify supervisor in writing or in person of any address or telephone number changes while on leave.\n- Return to work promptly at the end of an authorized leave.\n\n**D.5.b. Other Disability Leaves**\n\nIn addition to family/medical and pregnancy-related disability leaves, employees may request a temporary disability leave of absence if in the judgment of the Institute, it is necessary to accommodate reasonably a workplace injury or an ADA-qualified disability to the extent mandated by law. Any disability leave under this section may run concurrently with any medical leave to which the employee is entitled under the Family/Medical leave section of this handbook.\n\nEmployees taking disability leave must comply with the family/medical leave provision of this handbook regarding substitution of paid leaves, notice, and medical certification. For the purpose of applying these provisions, a disability leave will be considered a medical leave.\n\nAn employee taking a disability leave will not be paid and must exhaust her/his sick leave reserve and accrued CTO time.\n\nIf a disability leave under this section extends beyond 12 weeks in a 12-month period, the employee will not be entitled to any continued employer contributions towards any employee benefit plan. An employee, however, may elect to continue participating in such benefit plans, at the employee’s own expense, to the extent permitted by such plans.\n\nThe duration of a leave under this section will be consistent with applicable law, but in no event will the leave extend past the date on which an employee becomes capable of performing the essential functions of her/his position, with or without reasonable accommodation. For a full explanation of leave duration and reinstatement rights, employees should contact the Human Resources Office.\n\n**D.5.c. Jury Duty and Witness Leave**\n\nThe Institute encourages employees to serve on jury selection or jury duty when called. Any employee summoned for compulsory jury duty will be excused for the duration of the trial.\n\nA regular employee will receive her/his full salary for the time s/he is on duty, up to a maximum of 30 days in a 12-month period. An employee should notify her/his supervisor of the need for time off for jury duty as soon as a notice or summons from the court is received. A copy of the summons should be submitted when recording jury duty leave at the end of the pay period.\n\nAn employee may be requested to provide written verification from the court clerk of having served for Jury Duty. If work time remains after any day of jury selection or jury duty, the employee will be expected to return to work for the remainder of the work schedule.\n\nJurors’ fees, exclusive of mileage, that are received should be remitted to the Institute Cashier's office. Normal work hours that are spent on jury duty will not be considered as time worked for the purpose of computing overtime pay for non-exempt employees.\n\nAn employee who is required by law to appear in court or at another legal proceeding to which s/he is not a party will be provided time off for that purpose, provided s/he provides the Institute with reasonable advance notice. For non-exempt employees, this leave will be unpaid. For exempt employees, salary during leave will be offset by any amounts received as witness fees and no salary will be paid for workweeks in which no Institute work is performed.\n\n**D.5.d. Bereavement Leave**\n\nIn the event of a death in an employee's immediate family, s/he may be granted a leave of absence with pay not to exceed three working days, without any deduction from CTO or SLR balances.\n\nImmediate family includes mother, step-mother, father, step-father, spouse, domestic partner, child, step-child, brother, step-brother, sister, step-sister, current mother-in-law, current father-in-law, grandparents, and grandchildren. Bereavement leave requests must be made known to the supervisor as soon as the employee has need for the leave.\n\nApproved time taken in excess of three working days may be recorded as CTO or SLR.\n\nRegular Full-Time, Regular Part-Time and Temporary Employees with six months or more of service are eligible for Bereavement Leave.\n\n**D.5.e. Military Leave**\n\nThe Institute complies with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), which guarantees reemployment rights and benefits if an employee leaves to serve in the uniformed services as long as the cumulative period of absence from employment does not exceed five years.\n\nIf an employee serves in the military and needs to take military leave, s/he must inform her/his supervisor and contact the Human Resources Office for information about the employee’s rights and responsibilities before and after such leave. A regular employee will receive her/his full salary for the time s/he is recalled to active duty, up to a maximum of 30 days in a 12-month period. Annual training leave or leave for related schooling and/or training is considered leave without pay, although the employee may elect to use her/his CTO to cover the leave.\n\nThe employee is entitled to reinstatement upon completion of military service provided s/he returns or applies for reinstatement within the time allowed by law.\n\n**D.5.f. Personal Leave**\n\nA staff employee may apply for a non-medical leave of absence without pay of up to six months. Requests for leave of absence will be considered on the basis of the employee’s length of service, performance, responsibility level, the reason for the request, whether other individuals are already out on leave, and the expected impact of the leave on the Institute.\n\nBecause of the essential functions of most staff positions and the Institute’s lean staffing, approved personal leaves of absence are very limited. Requests must be submitted in writing to the supervisor and must be approved by the administration in writing before the leave begins.\n\nIt is the employee’s responsibility to report to work at the end of the approved leave. An employee who fails to report to work on the first working day after the leave expires will be considered to have voluntarily resigned.\n\n**D.5.g. School Activities**\n\nIf an employee is the parent or guardian of a child and it becomes necessary to attend the child's school because of a suspension, the employee should alert her/his supervisor as soon as possible. Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 230.7, no discriminatory action will be taken against an employee for taking time off for this purpose.\n\nAny school activity absence is subject to the following provisions:\n\n- Parents, guardians, or grandparents having custody of one or more children in pre-school, kindergarten, or grades 1 to 12 may take time off for a school activity.\n- The time off for school activity participation cannot exceed 40 hours for the entire school year and cannot exceed eight hours in any one calendar month.\n- Employees must provide as much advance notice as possible to their supervisor.\n- If both parents are employed by the Institute, the first employee to request such leave will receive the time off. The other parent will receive the time off only if the leave is approved by her/his supervisor.\n- Non-exempt employees must use CTO leave in order to receive compensation for this time off.\n- Exempt employees may take less than a full day off without loss of pay.\n- Employees who do not have paid CTO time available will take the time off without pay, or complete a make-up time arrangement through her/his supervisor.\n\n**D.5.h. Domestic Violence Leave**\n\nThe Institute will maintain the confidentiality of any employee requesting domestic violence leave to the extent possible.\n\nEmployees who are victims of domestic violence are entitled to take time off to:\n\n- get medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence,\n- get services from a domestic violence shelter or rape crisis center,\n- get psychological counseling for a domestic violence related experience,\n- try to ensure safety from future violence, including seeking restraining orders or other injunctive relief and/or temporary or permanent relocation.\n\nTo be eligible for leave, employees must qualify as domestic violence victims. This includes individuals who are being abused by:\n\n- a spouse or former spouse,\n- someone living with them,\n- someone they are (or were) dating,\n- someone they are (or were) engaged to,\n- someone they have a child with, or\n- a member of their immediate family or a very close relative.\n\nGenerally, employees must give their employers reasonable advance notice that they need time off for domestic violence leave. However, in certain circumstances, employees may take an unscheduled leave without giving advance notice.\n\nCertification for domestic violence leave may include:\n\n- a police report which indicates that the employee was a victim of domestic violence;\n- a court order protecting or separating the employee from the abuser, or other evidence from the court or prosecuting attorney that the employee appeared in court; or\n- a report from a medical professional, domestic violence advocate, health care provider, or counselor documenting that the employee was treated for mental or physical injuries.\n\nDomestic violence leave is unpaid. However, the employee may use any accrued CTO.\n\n**D.5.i. Required Use of Sick Pay Before Unpaid Leave**\n\nEmployees are required to take accrued and unused paid CTO/sick leave reserve before taking unpaid leave, or having unpaid absences. Family and Medical Leave (under both state and federal law) is included in this requirement.\n\nIf you are absent for a reason that qualifies you for Paid Family Leave (PFL) payments, and you have not yet accrued or have no CTO available, you are required to use any accrued and unused sick leave reserve during the 7-day waiting period before PFL benefits begin.\n\nYou must exhaust all paid CTO/sick leave reserve before taking any unpaid absences.\n\nPFL benefits do not replace all of your usual wages. Your PFL benefits will be supplemented with any accrued and unused CTO/sick leave reserve. If you have no sick leave reserve, or once you exhaust your sick leave reserve, accrued and unused CTO will be used to supplement your PFL benefits.\n\nEmployees who are absent because of their own disability may be eligible for State Disability Insurance (SDI) benefits. SDI payments do not begin until after you have been absent from work for 7 calendar days. If you have accrued paid sick leave reserve, sick leave reserve will be used for the first 7 days, before SDI payments begin. If you have no accrued sick leave reserve, any accrued CTO will be used during this waiting period.\n\nSDI benefits do not replace all of your usual wages. Your SDI benefits will be supplemented with any accrued and unused sick leave reserve. If you have no sick leave reserve, or once you exhaust your sick leave reserve, accrued and unused CTO will be used to supplement your SDI benefits.\n\n**D.5.j. Sick Pay and Workers’ Compensation Benefits**\n\nPaid sick leave is a benefit that also covers absences for work-related illness or injury. Employees who have a work-related illness or injury are covered by workers’ compensation insurance. However, workers’ compensation benefits usually do not cover absences for medical treatment. When you report a work-related illness or injury, you will be sent for medical treatment, if treatment is necessary. You will be paid your regular wages for the time you spend seeking initial medical treatment.\n\nAny further medical treatment will be under the direction of the health care provider. Any absences from work for follow-up treatment, physical therapy, or other prescribed appointments will not be paid as time worked. If you have accrued and unused sick leave, the additional absences from work will be paid with the use of sick leave. If you do not have accrued, paid sick leave, or if you have used all of your sick leave, you may choose to substitute CTO/paid time off for further work absences related to your illness or injury.\n\n**D.5.k. Safety Personnel Leave**\n\nEligible employees may take time off to serve as volunteer firefighters, reserve police officers, or emergency rescue personnel during emergencies. This leave is unpaid, though the employee can use any accrued CTO time.\n\nVolunteer firefighters, reserve police officers, and emergency rescue personnel may take leave only for emergency duty. There is no limit on the amount of time they may take off to perform emergency duties.\n\nVolunteer firefighters are also entitled to take up to 14 days each calendar year for fire or law enforcement training.\n","excerpt":"D.5. a. Family/Medical Leave A. General Provisions This policy is designed to provide the leaves required by the federal Family and Medical…","html":"<p><strong>D.5. a. Family/Medical Leave</strong></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>A. General Provisions</strong></span></h4>\n<p>This policy is designed to provide the leaves required by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act and California state law. This policy provides for paid and unpaid family and medical leave under the terms and conditions set forth below. Leaves are available for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the birth or adoption or foster care placement (by the state) of a child; or</li>\n<li>to care for the employee's child, parent, spouse, or domestic partner who has a serious health condition; or</li>\n<li>a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of her/his job.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are special rules that apply only to pregnancy-related disabilities.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>B. Eligibility for Leave</strong></span></h4>\n<p>In order to qualify for unpaid family and medical leave, other than a</p>\n<p>pregnancy disability leave, the employee must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>be employed for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours within the 12-month period prior to making a request for such leave;</li>\n<li>complete a certification of eligibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>C. Family and Medical Leave Definitions</strong></span></h4>\n<p>The unpaid family and medical leave policy is administered in accordance with the following definitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Child\" means biological, adopted, or foster child, a step-child, a legal ward or a child to whom the employee stands <em>in loco parentis</em>, who is under the age of 18, or is an adult dependent child, i.e., one who is incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability.</li>\n<li>\"Spouse\" means the employee's husband or wife as recognized by state law.</li>\n<li>\"Parent\" means the employee's biological parent or the individual who stood <em>in loco parentis</em> when the employee was a child. It does not include a grandparent or parent-in-law.</li>\n<li>\"Serious Health Condition\" means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that includes:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>1. in-patient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; or</p>\n<p>2. continuing treatment by a health care provider which includes</p>\n<p>any period of incapacity due to:</p>\n<p>(a) a health condition lasting more than three consecutive days, and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition, that also includes: treatment two or more times by or under the supervision of a health care provider; or one treatment by a health care provider with a continuing regimen of treatment; or</p>\n<p>(b) a chronic serious health condition which continues over an extended period of time, requires periodic visits to a health care provider, and may include occasional episodes of incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes). A visit to a health care provider is not necessary for each absence in this category; or</p>\n<p>(c) pregnancy-related disabilities (special rules apply); or</p>\n<p>(d) a permanent or long-term condition for which treatment may not be effective (e.g., Alzheimer’s, a severe stroke, terminal cancer). Only supervision by a health care provider is required, rather than active treatment; or</p>\n<p>(e) any absences to receive multiple treatments for restorative surgery or for a condition which would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three days if not treated (e.g., chemotherapy or radiation treatments for cancer).</p>\n<p>A \"serious health condition\" generally will not include conditions like the common cold, the flu, earaches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches (other than migraines), or routine dental problems, unless complications arise.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>D. Duration of Family and Medical Leave</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Employees may be granted a maximum of 12 weeks of family or medical leave in any 12-month period, unless otherwise required by law. For purposes of determining eligibility, the 12 months will be calculated backward from the date on which the employee first takes family or medical leave.</p>\n<p>Leave for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child must be concluded within one year of the birth or placement of the child. If both parents of a child are employed by the Institute and request family care leave to care for a newly arrived child, their aggregate childcare leave is limited to 12 weeks. The time each parent takes off will count against her/his 12-week allotment of family and medical leave. If an employee uses less than 12 weeks to care for a newly arrived child, the remainder of his/her 12 weeks of leave can be used for any permissible FMLA purpose.</p>\n<p>If there is a medical need, leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced work schedule basis to care for a sick family member or for an employee's own serious health condition. If the need for intermittent leave is foreseeable based on a planned medical treatment, the Institute reserves the right to require the employee to temporarily transfer to an equivalent position that can better accommodate the recurring periods of leave.</p>\n<p>Intermittent leave for the birth, adoption, or foster care of a child generally must be taken in two-week increments. However, the employee can take childcare leave in increments of less than two weeks on two occasions in connection with each birth, adoption, or placement for foster care.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>E. Notice/Certificates for Family and Medical Leave</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Employees must give the Institute as much advance notice as possible of the need for family or medical care leave. If the employee knows about the leave more than 30 calendar days before the leave is to commence, the employee must give the Institute at least 30 days written notice. If 30 days notice is not possible, i.e., the need for the leave is not known more than 30 days prior to its commencement, or because there has been a change in circumstances or a medical emergency, the employee must give as much notice as possible.</p>\n<p>Where the employee's need for the leave is for planned medical treatment or supervision, s/he must consult with the Institute to schedule the treatment to minimize the disruption of the Institute's business.</p>\n<p>The employee is required to provide a certificate from the health care provider setting out, among other things, the expected duration of the leave and certifying the condition warrants family or medical care. If the Institute does not receive proper certification prior to commencement of the leave or within 15 calendar days of requesting the certification, the absence from work may be deemed unexcused unless the delay was caused by circumstances truly beyond the employee's control.</p>\n<p>The Institute reserves the right to require a second opinion, at its own expense, regarding the employee's serious health condition. Also, in certain circumstances, recertification by the doctor may be requested.</p>\n<p>Generally, if given advance notice of the need for the leave, the Institute will designate the leave as family and medical leave before the employee goes out on leave. However, the Institute reserves the right to designate a leave as family and medical leave after the leave has begun if it learns of additional facts that allow it to make a determination while the employee is on leave. In addition, the Institute reserves the right to designate the leave as a family and medical leave after the employee returns to work if it does not have sufficient facts on which to make a determination while the employee is out on leave.</p>\n<p>If the Institute does not have sufficient information regarding why an employee is off work, it will inquire as to the reason for the employee's absence. If the employee establishes that the absence is for a family and medical leave or other permissible leave, the time off will be treated consistent with the applicable policy. However, if the employee does not provide the requested information or the information provided is insufficient to establish that the leave is for a purpose covered by the Family and Medical Leave Policy, the leave will be treated as an unexcused absence.</p>\n<p>In order to return to work from a medical leave for the employee's own serous health condition, s/he must submit a release to work certification form her/his health care provider.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>F. Benefits during Family or Medical Leave</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Employees must take any accrued sick leave reserve as part of any family and medical leave for their own serious health condition, including a pregnancy-related condition. In other circumstances, employees may take any accrued sick leave reserve as part of an unpaid family and medical leave when permitted by the sick leave policy. Employees must take any accrued CTO as part of any unpaid family and medical leave; special rules may apply to pregnancy disability leaves. After all paid leave is exhausted, the remaining period of the leave will be unpaid. Benefit Eligible Employees will continue earn CTO during the unpaid portion of any family or medical leave, but not during an accommodation leave.</p>\n<p>While taking unpaid family and medical leave, the Institute will continue to provide health benefits, including during pregnancy disability leave and child care leave, under the same terms and conditions as if the employee was still working. The employee will be required to continue paying the employee's portion of any premiums.</p>\n<p>Employees may arrange to pay for their own life insurance premiums and premiums for any other insurance during the unpaid portion of the leave. Coverage will terminate at the end of the last period for which premiums are received.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>G. Reinstatement</strong></span></h4>\n<p>If an employee returns to work at the end of an unpaid family or medical leave which lasts 12 weeks or less, s/he will be returned to the same position held before the leave or to an equivalent position with the same equivalent pay, benefits, and terms and conditions of employment. Special circumstances apply to pregnancy disabilities.</p>\n<p>An employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the employee had been continuously employed during the unpaid family and medical leave.</p>\n<p>If the employee fails to return to work on the next regularly scheduled workday following the expiration of the leave of absence, her/his employment will be subject to termination.</p>\n<p>All requests for family or medical leave of absences will be administered in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>H. Pregnancy Related Disability Leave</strong></span></h4>\n<p>In addition to the provisions above, the following policies apply when pregnancy results in a disability.  Pregnancy related disability leave will be designated as leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, but not under the equivalent California statute.</p>\n<p><em>1. Duration of Leave</em></p>\n<p>If an employee is disabled because of childbirth, pregnancy, or a related condition, she may take a leave of absence of up to four months with medical verification of the disability. Paid family leave is not available for care of a newborn, but only for the mother's own disability. However, after her doctor releases the employee to work, she may apply for a family care leave to care for her newborn.</p>\n<p>The estimated duration of pregnancy related disability leave is initially determined by the employee and her doctor. To assist in a smooth transition, employees should share this information with the Institute as far in advance as possible.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>I. Transfer Rights</strong></span></h4>\n<p>An employee who is pregnant is entitled to a transfer from her current position to a less strenuous or hazardous position or duties if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the employee provides a certification from her doctor stating less strenuous work is medically advisable; and</li>\n<li>transfer can be reasonably accommodated by the Institute.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If it is foreseeable that it would be medically advisable for a pregnant employee to take intermittent leave or work a reduced schedule, the Institute may require the employee to transfer temporarily to an available alternative position that has equivalent pay and benefits, so long as the employee is qualified for the position, and the position better accommodates recurring absences than the employee's regular job.</p>\n<p>The employee will be reinstated to her regular job or a comparable position when the employee's health care provider certifies that there is no further need for less strenuous work, intermittent leave, or a reduced work schedule.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>J. Rights to Reasonable Accommodation</strong></span></h4>\n<p>The Institute will make a reasonable accommodation for conditions that are related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions if requested by an employee, with the advice of her health care provider, to the extent provided by law.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>K. Benefits During Pregnancy Related Disability Leave</strong></span></h4>\n<p>An employee must take any accrued sick leave reserve as part of her pregnancy related disability leave. An employee may take any accrued CTO as part of her pregnancy disability leave. After all paid leave is exhausted, the remainder of the employee's pregnancy disability leave will be unpaid.</p>\n<p>The Institute will continue to provide health benefits for an employee on pregnancy related disability under the same terms and conditions as if the employee were still working. The employee will be required to continue paying the employee's portion of any premiums. For policies regarding other benefits, refer to the section of this handbook dealing with benefits during family and medical leave. With respect to all benefits, an employee on paid family leave will be treated no less favorably than employees on other disability related leaves.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>L. Reinstatement After a Pregnancy Related Disability</strong></span></h4>\n<p>If an employee returns to work at the end of a pregnancy disability of four months or less, she will be reinstated to her former position unless the position no longer exists because of business changes, such as a reduction in force or job abolishment. If the employee's former position does not exist, she will be reinstated to an equivalent position, if one is available.</p>\n<p>The employee will be required to provide the Institute with a fitness for duty certification from her doctor stating she is released to return to work and indicating any work restrictions she may have.</p>\n<p>If the employee fails to return to work at the end of any authorized leave, her employment will be subject to termination, unless she is eligible for another form of leave.</p>\n<p><span>M. Child Care Leave After a Pregnancy Related Disability Leave</span></p>\n<p>After the employee is released to return to work from a pregnancy disability, she may request any remaining family and medical leave to care for her newborn, pursuant to the terms of the family and medical leave policy above.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #660000;\"><strong>N. Employee Responsibilities</strong></span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Furnish evidence as requested to substantiate the medical need for disability leave.</li>\n<li>Notify the Institute in the event the need for or anticipated duration of the leave has changed.</li>\n<li>Notify supervisor in writing or in person two (2) weeks prior to the expiration of the leave to confirm interest in return to work.</li>\n<li>Notify supervisor in writing or in person of any address or telephone number changes while on leave.</li>\n<li>Return to work promptly at the end of an authorized leave.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>D.5.b. Other Disability Leaves</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to family/medical and pregnancy-related disability leaves, employees may request a temporary disability leave of absence if in the judgment of the Institute, it is necessary to accommodate reasonably a workplace injury or an ADA-qualified disability to the extent mandated by law. Any disability leave under this section may run concurrently with any medical leave to which the employee is entitled under the Family/Medical leave section of this handbook.</p>\n<p>Employees taking disability leave must comply with the family/medical leave provision of this handbook regarding substitution of paid leaves, notice, and medical certification. For the purpose of applying these provisions, a disability leave will be considered a medical leave.</p>\n<p>An employee taking a disability leave will not be paid and must exhaust her/his sick leave reserve and accrued CTO time.</p>\n<p>If a disability leave under this section extends beyond 12 weeks in a 12-month period, the employee will not be entitled to any continued employer contributions towards any employee benefit plan. An employee, however, may elect to continue participating in such benefit plans, at the employee’s own expense, to the extent permitted by such plans.</p>\n<p>The duration of a leave under this section will be consistent with applicable law, but in no event will the leave extend past the date on which an employee becomes capable of performing the essential functions of her/his position, with or without reasonable accommodation. For a full explanation of leave duration and reinstatement rights, employees should contact the Human Resources Office.</p>\n<p><strong>D.5.c. Jury Duty and Witness Leave</strong></p>\n<p>The Institute encourages employees to serve on jury selection or jury duty when called. Any employee summoned for compulsory jury duty will be excused for the duration of the trial.</p>\n<p>A regular employee will receive her/his full salary for the time s/he is on duty, up to a maximum of 30 days in a 12-month period. An employee should notify her/his supervisor of the need for time off for jury duty as soon as a notice or summons from the court is received. A copy of the summons should be submitted when recording jury duty leave at the end of the pay period.</p>\n<p>An employee may be requested to provide written verification from the court clerk of having served for Jury Duty. If work time remains after any day of jury selection or jury duty, the employee will be expected to return to work for the remainder of the work schedule.</p>\n<p>Jurors’ fees, exclusive of mileage, that are received should be remitted to the Institute Cashier's office. Normal work hours that are spent on jury duty will not be considered as time worked for the purpose of computing overtime pay for non-exempt employees.</p>\n<p>An employee who is required by law to appear in court or at another legal proceeding to which s/he is not a party will be provided time off for that purpose, provided s/he provides the Institute with reasonable advance notice. For non-exempt employees, this leave will be unpaid. For exempt employees, salary during leave will be offset by any amounts received as witness fees and no salary will be paid for workweeks in which no Institute work is performed.</p>\n<p><strong>D.5.d. Bereavement Leave</strong></p>\n<p>In the event of a death in an employee's immediate family, s/he may be granted a leave of absence with pay not to exceed three working days, without any deduction from CTO or SLR balances.</p>\n<p>Immediate family includes mother, step-mother, father, step-father, spouse, domestic partner, child, step-child, brother, step-brother, sister, step-sister, current mother-in-law, current father-in-law, grandparents, and grandchildren. Bereavement leave requests must be made known to the supervisor as soon as the employee has need for the leave.</p>\n<p>Approved time taken in excess of three working days may be recorded as CTO or SLR.</p>\n<p>Regular Full-Time, Regular Part-Time and Temporary Employees with six months or more of service are eligible for Bereavement Leave.</p>\n<p><strong>D.5.e. Military Leave</strong></p>\n<p>The Institute complies with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), which guarantees reemployment rights and benefits if an employee leaves to serve in the uniformed services as long as the cumulative period of absence from employment does not exceed five years.</p>\n<p>If an employee serves in the military and needs to take military leave, s/he must inform her/his supervisor and contact the Human Resources Office for information about the employee’s rights and responsibilities before and after such leave. A regular employee will receive her/his full salary for the time s/he is recalled to active duty, up to a maximum of 30 days in a 12-month period. Annual training leave or leave for related schooling and/or training is considered leave without pay, although the employee may elect to use her/his CTO to cover the leave.</p>\n<p>The employee is entitled to reinstatement upon completion of military service provided s/he returns or applies for reinstatement within the time allowed by law.</p>\n<p><strong>D.5.f. Personal Leave</strong></p>\n<p>A staff employee may apply for a non-medical leave of absence without pay of up to six months. Requests for leave of absence will be considered on the basis of the employee’s length of service, performance, responsibility level, the reason for the request, whether other individuals are already out on leave, and the expected impact of the leave on the Institute.</p>\n<p>Because of the essential functions of most staff positions and the Institute’s lean staffing, approved personal leaves of absence are very limited. Requests must be submitted in writing to the supervisor and must be approved by the administration in writing before the leave begins.</p>\n<p>It is the employee’s responsibility to report to work at the end of the approved leave. An employee who fails to report to work on the first working day after the leave expires will be considered to have voluntarily resigned.</p>\n<p><strong>D.5.g. School Activities</strong></p>\n<p>If an employee is the parent or guardian of a child and it becomes necessary to attend the child's school because of a suspension, the employee should alert her/his supervisor as soon as possible. Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 230.7, no discriminatory action will be taken against an employee for taking time off for this purpose.</p>\n<p>Any school activity absence is subject to the following provisions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parents, guardians, or grandparents having custody of one or more children in pre-school, kindergarten, or grades 1 to 12 may take time off for a school activity.</li>\n<li>The time off for school activity participation cannot exceed 40 hours for the entire school year and cannot exceed eight hours in any one calendar month.</li>\n<li>Employees must provide as much advance notice as possible to their supervisor.</li>\n<li>If both parents are employed by the Institute, the first employee to request such leave will receive the time off. The other parent will receive the time off only if the leave is approved by her/his supervisor.</li>\n<li>Non-exempt employees must use CTO leave in order to receive compensation for this time off.</li>\n<li>Exempt employees may take less than a full day off without loss of pay.</li>\n<li>Employees who do not have paid CTO time available will take the time off without pay, or complete a make-up time arrangement through her/his supervisor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>D.5.h. Domestic Violence Leave</strong></p>\n<p>The Institute will maintain the confidentiality of any employee requesting domestic violence leave to the extent possible.</p>\n<p>Employees who are victims of domestic violence are entitled to take time off to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>get medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence,</li>\n<li>get services from a domestic violence shelter or rape crisis center,</li>\n<li>get psychological counseling for a domestic violence related experience,</li>\n<li>try to ensure safety from future violence, including seeking restraining orders or other injunctive relief and/or temporary or permanent relocation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be eligible for leave, employees must qualify as domestic violence victims. This includes individuals who are being abused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a spouse or former spouse,</li>\n<li>someone living with them,</li>\n<li>someone they are (or were) dating,</li>\n<li>someone they are (or were) engaged to,</li>\n<li>someone they have a child with, or</li>\n<li>a member of their immediate family or a very close relative.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Generally, employees must give their employers reasonable advance notice that they need time off for domestic violence leave. However, in certain circumstances, employees may take an unscheduled leave without giving advance notice.</p>\n<p>Certification for domestic violence leave may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a police report which indicates that the employee was a victim of domestic violence;</li>\n<li>a court order protecting or separating the employee from the abuser, or other evidence from the court or prosecuting attorney that the employee appeared in court; or</li>\n<li>a report from a medical professional, domestic violence advocate, health care provider, or counselor documenting that the employee was treated for mental or physical injuries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Domestic violence leave is unpaid. However, the employee may use any accrued CTO.</p>\n<p><strong>D.5.i. Required Use of Sick Pay Before Unpaid Leave</strong></p>\n<p>Employees are required to take accrued and unused paid CTO/sick leave reserve before taking unpaid leave, or having unpaid absences. Family and Medical Leave (under both state and federal law) is included in this requirement.</p>\n<p>If you are absent for a reason that qualifies you for Paid Family Leave (PFL) payments, and you have not yet accrued or have no CTO available, you are required to use any accrued and unused sick leave reserve during the 7-day waiting period before PFL benefits begin.</p>\n<p>You must exhaust all paid CTO/sick leave reserve before taking any unpaid absences.</p>\n<p>PFL benefits do not replace all of your usual wages. Your PFL benefits will be supplemented with any accrued and unused CTO/sick leave reserve. If you have no sick leave reserve, or once you exhaust your sick leave reserve, accrued and unused CTO will be used to supplement your PFL benefits.</p>\n<p>Employees who are absent because of their own disability may be eligible for State Disability Insurance (SDI) benefits. SDI payments do not begin until after you have been absent from work for 7 calendar days. If you have accrued paid sick leave reserve, sick leave reserve will be used for the first 7 days, before SDI payments begin. If you have no accrued sick leave reserve, any accrued CTO will be used during this waiting period.</p>\n<p>SDI benefits do not replace all of your usual wages. Your SDI benefits will be supplemented with any accrued and unused sick leave reserve. If you have no sick leave reserve, or once you exhaust your sick leave reserve, accrued and unused CTO will be used to supplement your SDI benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>D.5.j. Sick Pay and Workers’ Compensation Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>Paid sick leave is a benefit that also covers absences for work-related illness or injury. Employees who have a work-related illness or injury are covered by workers’ compensation insurance. However, workers’ compensation benefits usually do not cover absences for medical treatment. When you report a work-related illness or injury, you will be sent for medical treatment, if treatment is necessary. You will be paid your regular wages for the time you spend seeking initial medical treatment.</p>\n<p>Any further medical treatment will be under the direction of the health care provider. Any absences from work for follow-up treatment, physical therapy, or other prescribed appointments will not be paid as time worked. If you have accrued and unused sick leave, the additional absences from work will be paid with the use of sick leave. If you do not have accrued, paid sick leave, or if you have used all of your sick leave, you may choose to substitute CTO/paid time off for further work absences related to your illness or injury.</p>\n<p><strong>D.5.k. Safety Personnel Leave</strong></p>\n<p>Eligible employees may take time off to serve as volunteer firefighters, reserve police officers, or emergency rescue personnel during emergencies. This leave is unpaid, though the employee can use any accrued CTO time.</p>\n<p>Volunteer firefighters, reserve police officers, and emergency rescue personnel may take leave only for emergency duty. There is no limit on the amount of time they may take off to perform emergency duties.</p>\n<p>Volunteer firefighters are also entitled to take up to 14 days each calendar year for fire or law enforcement training.</p>"},"e0a2b7be-18e3-5a85-bb26-be5c24bb893b":{"id":"e0a2b7be-18e3-5a85-bb26-be5c24bb893b","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/d-employee-handbook/d-6-miscellaneous-considerations","title":"D.6. Miscellaneous Considerations","body":"\n**D.6.a. Lost and Found**\n\nMoney, clothing, or other valuables should not be left in areas where a theft might occur. The Institute's lost and found area is located in the Security Office. The Institute is not responsible for lost or stolen property.\n\n**D.6.b. Parking**\n\nAll on-campus parking is by permit only, and permits are issued to employees residing a mile or more from the campus. Eligible employees may request a permit from Security. Vehicles may be parked in designated parking stalls as space permits in the faculty/staff parking areas. If space is not available, employees must park off Institute property. Employees may not use Institute parking areas specifically designated for students. Handicap parking is by permit only. The Institute is not responsible for any loss or damage to employee vehicles or contents while parked on Institute property.\n\n**D.6.c. Lactation Accommodation**\n\nThe Institute will provide a reasonable amount of break time to accommodate an employee desiring to express breast milk for the employee's infant child. The break time will, if possible, run concurrently with any paid break time that is already provided to the employee. If additional break time is required, it shall be unpaid.\n\n**D.6.d. Outside Organizational Activity/Solicitation**\n\nEmployees are expected to devote their working hours to job-related activities that contribute to the goals and objectives of the Middlebury Institute. Except for activities related directly to the benefit of the Institute, employees may not solicit, distribute, or receive solicitation materials during working time or in work areas. Work areas generally exclude eating areas, parking lots, or employee lounges. Working time excludes unpaid lunch break, rest periods, or any other specified period during the workday when employees are not required to engage in performing their work tasks.\n\nBecause of the Institute's status as a nonprofit organization, no employee may use the Institute's name in carrying on any partisan political activity. The name of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, the logo commonly used to represent the Institute, or the name of any department of the Institute should not be used on letters or other written material intended for political purposes.\n\n**D.6.e. Security Investigations**\n\nThe Institute seeks to maintain a safe, healthy, and secure work environment. The Institute may occasionally find it necessary to investigate current employees where behavior or other relevant circumstances raise questions (For example, work performance, honesty, trustworthiness, or potential threat to the safety of coworkers or others). In the event that an investigation is necessary, the Institute will comply with all applicable federal and state laws. Employees subject to an investigation are required to cooperate with the Institute’s lawful efforts to obtain relevant information and may be disciplined up to and including termination for failure to do so.\n\n**D.6.f. Health and Safety**\n\nEach employee is responsible for her/his safety as well as the safety of others in the workplace. In compliance with California law and to promote the concept of a safe workplace, the Institute maintains an Injury and Illness Prevention Program. The program is available for review in the Human Resources 7office. All accidents that result in injury must be reported to the appropriate supervisor and Human Resources, regardless of how insignificant the injury may appear. Such reports are necessary to comply with laws and to initiate insurance and workers’ compensation procedures as applicable.\n\nIn compliance with Proposition 65, the Institute will inform employees of any known exposure to a chemical known to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.\n\n**D.6.g. Emergency Closure**\n\nIf weather conditions, such as flooding, prevent employees from safely traveling to work, they must notify their supervisors as soon as possible. Absences due to inclement weather will be considered as leave without pay, unless the employee chooses to use accrued CTO hours to cover the absence.\n\nIn the event of a natural disaster such as earthquake, fire, explosion, etc., offices will be closed if the building is damaged or roads immediately leading to the offices are damaged. For instruction on reporting to another location, employees should contact their supervisors immediately, if possible. Refer to the Emergency Action Plan ([https://www.miis.edu/offices/security](https://www.miis.edu/offices/security)) for further details.\n\nIf the Institute is closed due to inclement weather or natural disaster, regular salaried employees will receive regular pay, up to a maximum of three days per calendar year. If the Institute is open, yet an employee is unable to get to work due to personal circumstances, the time off will be counted as leave without pay, unless the employee elects to use accrued CTO hours. If there is a temporary power outage, employees are expected to remain at work and perform what duties are safely possible under the circumstances, until and unless they are officially notified that the office is closed for the remainder of the day and that there is no other office on campus where they can continue to work.\n\n**D.6.h. Security/Workplace Violence**\n\nThe Institute is committed to providing a workplace that is free from acts of violence or threats of violence. In keeping with this commitment, the Institute has established a policy that provides “zero tolerance” for actual or threatened violence against co-workers, students, visitors, or any other persons who are either on our premises or have contact with employees in the course of their duties.\n\nEvery threat of violence is serious and must be treated as such. Threatening behavior can include such actions as throwing objects, making a verbal threat to harm another individual or destroy property, displaying an intense or obsessive romantic interest that exceeds the normal bounds of interpersonal interest, or attempting to intimidate or harass other individuals.\n\nIf an employee becomes aware of any actual violence, imminent violence, or threat of imminent violence, obtaining emergency assistance must be a matter of first priority. The employee should immediately contact Security by calling extension 4153 and, if appropriate, should contact Monterey Police Department authorities by dialing 911\\. Then the employee must report the incident to her/his supervisor, who shall in turn notify the manager of human resources and Security. Employees may report any incidents of violence or threats of violence without fear of reprisal.\n\nEmployees who become aware of any threats of workplace violence must report the threats immediately to their supervisors, who, in turn, will be responsible for notifying Security and the Manager of Human Resources.\n\nCompliance with this anti-violence policy is a condition of employment and will be evaluated, together with other aspects of an employee’s performance. Due to the importance of this policy, employees who violate any of its terms, who engage in or contribute to violent behavior, or who threaten others with violence may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination.\n\nEmployees are reminded to secure their desks, files, and confidential information at the end of the day or when called away from the work area for an extended length of time. Employees should not leave valuable and/or personal articles in or around their workstations.\n\nEmployees must immediately report to their supervisor when keys, identification cards, or other Institute property is missing.\n\n**D.6.i. Travel Policies**\n\nMembers of the faculty and staff traveling on behalf of the Institute are expected to seek the least expensive option that allows them to do their job effectively and safely when incurring any expense that will be charged to the Institute.\n\nAll travel plans and individual travel programs must be approved in advance by the employee’s supervisor and the budget officer of the department to be charged with the travel costs.\n\nAdvances for travel are prohibited except in cases where travel without an advance would impose an unreasonable hardship. Requests for advance are officially discouraged. Recommendations for advances must have the approval of the department head, VPAA, and the VP for Human Resources and Chief Risk Officer.\n\nTravelers booking plane or train fares must secure the most economical rates available and should use an individual or departmental Institute purchasing card whenever possible, following all policies associated with such cards. If a personal credit card must be used, the traveler must submit original copies of the card statement along with accounting codes to be charged and a clear explanation of the itinerary in order to receive timely reimbursement.\n\nThe Institute reimburses members of the faculty and staff using their own vehicles on trips for official Institute business on a per-mile-driven basis, at the rate authorized by the IRS. Requests for reimbursement, using the check request form, must include details of the dates, points of departure and arrival, and miles driven, and should be submitted to the Business Office.\n\nEmployees who are required to drive an Institute vehicle, or a personal vehicle, on Institute business will be required to show proof of current, valid driver's license and current effective insurance coverage prior to the first day of employment.\n\nThe Institute retains the right to transfer to an alternative position, suspend or terminate employment if driving on Institute business is an essential function of a position and an employee's license is revoked, or s/he fails to maintain personal automobile insurance coverage, or if s/he is uninsurable under the Institute's policy.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**A. Allowable Travel Expenses**</span>\n\nAllowable travel expenses include essential transportation and associated costs such as parking and tolls, lodging, meals, and appropriate thank-you gifts for a dinner or event host. Normally, travelers should select compact class rental cars; restrict meal costs to the recommended maximums published by the business office; and provide customary tips (not to exceed 15%) associated with their activities. Other expenses must receive advance approval from the department head.\n\n#### <span style=\"color: #660000;\">**B. Accounting**</span>\n\nFormal accounting for reimbursable travel expenditures made by an individual must be submitted to the Business Office immediately upon return from a trip. This accounting must include original receipts for meal, hotel accommodations, transportation, etc., and must be approved by the supervisor and budget officer.\n\nInternal Revenue Service regulations require that adequate records substantiate all expenditures for travel and entertainment. This substantiation must include information relating to the:\n\n- Amount of the expenditure;\n- Time and place of the expenditure;\n- Business purpose of the expenditure; and\n- Names and the business relationships of individuals (other than the traveler) for whom the expenditures are made;\n\nReasonable incidental expenses of $10 or less do not require documentation but need to be enumerated.\n\n**D.6.j. Travel Expenses Not Permitted**\n\nNo expenses for a spouse/partner accompanying the faculty or staff member may be charged to the Institute, with the exception of the cost of a meal if the spouse/partner's presence is essential to the event and where there has been prior approval.\n\nNo personal expenses may be charged to the Institute, including (but not limited to) traffic and parking tickets; rental, repair, and replacement of clothing items; personal entertainment such as sporting-event or theatre tickets and in-room movies; alcoholic beverages other than those customarily taken with a meal that is part of an Institute function; and any item which an individual would normally purchase for her/himself if not traveling.\n\n**D.6.k. Other Expenditures Not Permitted**\n\nBudget administrators are expected to exercise restraint and good judgment in committing Institute funds. The Institute's principal revenue sources are from students and from donors (individuals, foundations, and industry). Increasingly, we must be sensitive to how we use these funds toward promoting the primary mission of the Institute. The following expenditures should not be incurred since they relate more directly to personal needs:\n\n- Artwork for offices\n- Briefcases\n- Contributions (political and charitable)\n- Expensive desk accessories\n- Flowers (except when coordinated through the VPAA's Office)\n- Holiday decorations and parties\n- Memberships in non-job related professional societies\n- Travel related:\n\n- Air travel clubs\n- First class/business class airfare\n\n- Health club memberships\n- Hotel amenities (movies, etc.)\n- Optional conference events (golf outings, tours, etc.)\n- Non-business entertainment and travel\n- Payment of fines or parking tickets\n- Purchase of clothing and other personal items\n- Spouse related costs\n- Meals among co-workers (except when staff are traveling together on Institute business, or for community-building meals approved by a budget administrator.)\n\n**D.6.l. Procurement Card Program**\n\nThe Middlebury Institute has implemented a Procurement Card Program to provide an efficient and effective method of purchasing and paying for goods and services. Procurement Cards are issued to individuals who place orders on behalf of the Institute and/or individuals who frequently travel on Institute business. An individual receives a procurement card upon recommendation of her/his department head, and then only after completing the application form and cardholder agreement, and after attending a Procurement Card Training Session to learn the proper procedures for using and documenting use of the card. Complete guidelines for P-card use can be found at: [https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/administration/vpfin/controller/paymen...](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/administration/vpfin/controller/payment/pcard)\n\nCardholders are accountable for the proper use of Institute funds. Although the card is issued to the cardholder, it remains Institute property, and may be rescinded at any time. Use of the card is **only for Institute business**. If the procurement card is misused (for example, for inappropriate purchases, exceeding budget and or card limits, or failure to maintain proper records) penalties could range from a warning to adhere to the procedures to cancellation of the card. Should the Institute cancel a card, that action will be noted in the cardholder’s personnel file. In extreme cases, such as flagrant misuse and/or use for personal items, additional consequences, up to and including termination of employment could be imposed.\n\nThe adoption of the Procurement Card does not constitute a change to the Institute policies regarding travel on Institute business. Rather, for many Institute employees whose job responsibilities dictate regular travel, the \"P Card\" will provide a means to process and pay those travel expenses more conveniently.\n\nFaculty and staff with only occasional travel needs may be able to make use of a \"departmental\" card held by an administrative assistant or other departmental support staff who make air, hotel, or auto reservations for department faculty and staff.\n\nAs with any travel on Institute business currently made using a personal credit card with subsequent reimbursement, it is the responsibility of the traveler using a Procurement Card to obtain full documentation/receipts for all expenses processed on the card and to file and retain those receipts with the monthly statement mailed to the cardholder.\n\nPlease direct any questions regarding the use of the Procurement Card to the card administrator.\n\n**D.6.m. Employee Recognition**\n\n#### _<span style=\"color: #660000;\">**Above and Beyond Award**</span>_\n\n<span>The Above and Beyond Award was established in 2006 to recognize employees of the Institute who go above and beyond the normal duties of their position. The award is presented during the faculty/staff holiday reception each December. Each award recipient receives a certificate and a $500 cash award. Recipients of the award are those who:</span>\n\na)     Consistently provide outstanding customer service.\n\nb)     Is the “go-to” person.\n\nc)     Provides an outstanding service that is not part of their normal job duties.\n\nd)     Strives to innovate, improve, or streamline processes.\n\nThe VPAA and the senior administrators (direct reports to the VPAA) will consult with staff in their areas to nominate candidates. Generally, up to three awards will be made during the Faculty/Staff Holiday Reception.\n","excerpt":"D.6.a.

Language and Intercultural Competency (ICC) Requirements at the Middlebury Institute","body":"\n**A.  Background to the Language and ICC Component**\n\nLanguage is central to all degree programs at the Middlebury Institute, therefore a Language and ICC component is included as part of the core requirements of most degree programs.  Most of our language courses are _content-based_, which means that we aim to develop field-specific content knowledge while at the same time focusing on the development of linguistic skills.\n\nAll degree students except TESOL, TI, and PC MBA, have a Language and ICC component in their degree program. Students cannot take a competency exam (standardized test in the language) to bypass language study.\n\n**B.  Regularly Taught Languages at the Middlebury Institute**\n\nArabic, Chinese (Mandarin), English, French, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish are offered as a regular part of the academic year curriculum, subject to sufficient student enrollment.\n\n**C.  Languages Not Regularly Taught at the Middlebury Institute**\n\nRequests to fulfill the language component in a language not regularly offered by the Institute must be directed <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">at the time of admission to the Middlebury Institute</span> to the Language Studies Advisor. The feasibility of offering certain language courses is assessed at the time of request, but fully determined at the time of enrollment. The non-regular language courses have the same proficiency level and credit requirement and adhere to the same standards as the other regular language courses. Applicants requesting a special language must be able to demonstrate 200-level proficiency in their requested language.  Students who request non-regular language courses should also know that setting up a course in non-regular languages will incur additional costs.\n\n**D. Required Language Levels**\n\nTo enroll in Language Studies courses at the Middlebury Institute, students must have attained 200-level/second year university level/Intermediate for all languages offered.\n\nDuring the admission process, any students who may have insufficient proficiency to place into the LS program are required to work on Language Plans to build sufficient proficiency. If prior language study proves insufficient to meet the placement at the required levels (indicated above), students will not be allowed to begin in the language program until they acquire the minimum required proficiency in the language. _<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Note that a delay in beginning the language component of the degree program may delay graduation, and may incur additional expenses.</span>_\n\nStudents whose first (native) language is a language other than English, or students who did not have secondary and post-secondary education (high school and college) in an English-speaking country, are considered to be non-native speakers of English.  They are required to take English for Academic and Professional Purposes (EAPP) courses to fulfill the requirement in the language component.\n\nStudents whose first (native) language is English, or students who have had secondary and post-secondary education (high school and college) in an English-speaking environment, are considered to be native speakers of English.  EAPP courses do not count toward fulfillment of the language requirement for native speakers of English.\n\n**1.  Provisional Admits with low TOEFL scores**\n\nNon-native speakers of English who are provisionally admitted to the Middlebury Institute with TOEFL scores below the stated minimum must either obtain the required minimum score before beginning their degree programs, or enroll in (and successfully complete) English Preparation for Graduate Study (EPGS) the summer before beginning their degree programs.\n\nSome non-native speakers of English who meet the stated minimum TOEFL test scores may still be required to take 200-level EAPP courses or equivalent courses in the first semester of their degree program based on the results of the EAPP placement test.  As this coursework is below the 300-level minimum required to fulfill the language component of the degree programs, this coursework will not count toward fulfillment of the language requirement.  _<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Note that this required coursework may also delay graduation and/or incur additional expenses.</span>_\n\n**2\\. Prospective/New students with Lower Language Proficiency than required**\n\nProspective students who do not have sufficient language study history on their transcripts or who have outdated language coursework are required to contact the Language Study Advisor to work out a Language Plan (LP) during the admission process.  This Language Plan will lay out a concrete plan to assist in equipping students with sufficient proficiency in their chosen language (LOS) prior to enrollment in the degree programs.  _<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Failure to complete the LP may result in revoking or deferring admission.</span>_\n\nNew students who take the language placement test and fail to place at the required language levels will meet with Language Studies Advisor to work out an In-Degree Language Plan (IDLP) which will determine a concrete plan and timeline for raising the student’s language proficiency to the necessary level for LS study and completing the language component of the degree program.  Registration for courses may be put on hold until students have an acceptable IDLP.\n\n**E. Language Studies Placement**\n\nLanguage level placement in the Language Studies (LS) program is determined by online placement tests taken just prior to Orientation week each semester. Previous language coursework is not considered for placement purposes.  Students are contacted prior to orientation with details about taking the placement tests.\n\nOn the basis of placement test performance, Language Studies faculty will suggest or require certain level courses that best fit the students’ current language proficiency and development needs.  Each subsequent semester, the Language Studies instructors give pre-approval for certain courses to be taken in following semester.  The result of the placement test, or the pre-approved course placement by an LS instructor, is only honored for the particular semester that the test is taken or the pre-approval was intended. If taking a leave of absence from language study, or from MIIS, students are required to take language placement test again when they return in order to determine the course that best fits their proficiency level at the time of their return.\n\nIf a student feels that he/she possesses sufficient level of professional proficiency in the language to waive some of his/her language requirement, a waiver exam can be requested.

Higher language skills requirement**\n\nThe following programs require superior language proficiency: Teaching Foreign Language (TFL); Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL); and all degrees in Translation, Interpretation, and Localization Management (TILM).  Proficiency in languages required for these degrees is assessed at the time of admission.\n\n**3\\. Options for Fulfilling LS and ICC Requirements**\n\nThere are a number of options for fulfilling the Language and ICC component requirement at MIIS.  Students may complete the Language and ICC component in successive semesters, or may skip a semester from language study.  Students may also participate in one of the many Study Abroad programs that we have with Middlebury College, and may earn up to 12 credits while abroad to meet the language component.  Those who have at least mid-300 level language proficiency may also earn credits while participating in an overseas internship completed during the J-term or summer.  If desired, students may also transfer 2-4 credits of language or ICC courses from an outside institution (with pre-approval) to augment the credits earned at MIIS.\n\nStudents may also take more language courses than required, or take a third or fourth language, as long as they have room in their schedule and they can count them as electives in their degree programs.\n\nThe Language Studies Advisor can assist in developing an appropriate plan to incorporate language study into the degree map for those who would like to plan a semester away.\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">PLEASE NOTE</span>:** Due to the distribution of language level courses, it is not normally possible to take multiple language courses (to “double-up”) in a single language in any given semester. Thus, it is strongly recommended to carefully map out all language coursework for the degree track.  _<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Postponing the start of Language Studies is strongly discouraged and may lead to a delay in graduation</span>_<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">.</span>\n\n**<span>4\\. Directed Study for Language and ICC courses</span>**\n\nStudents may request a Directed Study (DS) in language courses at 300-level or above for 2 or 4 credits.  In order to propose a Directed Study course, students need to have a concrete self-initiated project in mind, and they must seek a faculty member who agrees to supervise the project in advance.  _<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">It is entirely the prerogative of the faculty member whether or not he/she agrees to work with a student on a Directed Study</span>_<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">.</span> Students who wish to earn language credits by taking a Directed Study course need to complete and submit a LS DS proposal form and obtain the faculty supervisor’s signature.\n\nStudents may also request a Directed Study (DS) in ICC courses for 2 or 4 credits.  A DS in ICC is approved (a) to pursue in greater depth a subject to which she/he has already been introduced in a MIIS course, but is unable to find more advanced treatment of the topic in the regular menu of seminars; or (b) to research a question or topic not offered by the MIIS curriculum, but which the advising professor and the Dean agree has intellectual/professional merit, and is operationally feasible.  The student and the faculty advisor together develop a work plan, including a timeline and specified deliverables. Students need to seek a faculty member who agrees to supervise the project in advance. Only regular/full-time faculty members may act as ICC DS advisors. Supervising faculty are expected to have expertise in ICC. This includes faculty serving on the ICC steering committee or teaching ICC courses at MIIS. Exceptions may be made with the approval of the ICC chair.\n\n**5\\. Transfer of language and ICC credits**\n\n**a. Transferring credit from an outside institution**\n\nTo be eligible for transfer, coursework in language or intercultural competence (ICC) must be completed <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">after</span> a student has started in the Language Studies program at MIIS, which means that s/he has taken the placement test, and has been assigned an appropriate level of study for the degree program.\n\nIf a student’s degree program requires 12 credits of language study, s/he may transfer up to 4 credits of language from an outside institution. If a student’s degree program requires 8 credits of language study, s/he may transfer up to 2 credits of language from an outside institution.  Outside institutions include any accredited school/institution outside of Middlebury. Credits earned at any outside institutions and transferred to MIIS will not be calculated as part of the student’s GPA.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">The student must obtain pre-approval from the GSTILE Dean before taking courses elsewhere*.*</span>  This is achieved by submitting a petition for transfer of credit, which is reviewed by the appropriate language or ICC faculty member to determine the course’s equivalence to Institute courses that fulfill the same requirement.\n\nStudents must earn a grade of B or above in in order to receive transfer credit for a course. Transfer credit will not be added to the students’ transcript until the Records Office receives an official transcript from the institution where the credit was earned.\n\n**b. Transferring credit from a Middlebury program**\n\nNormally students may transfer 2-4 credits earned in the Summer Intensive Language Program (SILP) at MIIS and/or a Middlebury Summer Language School.  Students may petition to transfer more than 2-4 credits.\n\nUp to 12 credits may be transferred if they are earned in a Middlebury School Abroad program.\n\nStudents must earn a grade of B or above in order to receive credit toward the MIIS degree for a course from another Middlebury program.  Credits earned at any of the Middlebury programs that are used toward the MIIS language requirement <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">will</span> be included in the calculation of the student’s GPA.\n\n**c. Credits earned prior to matriculation**\n\nLanguage or ICC coursework taken prior to enrolling in the Language Studies program at MIIS is not transferrable.  The only exception is coursework taken in SILP or Middlebury’s Summer Language School in the summer <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">directly preceding</span> enrollment in the MA program.  Students may apply to use 2-4 SILP or Middlebury Summer Language School credits toward their MIIS degree.\n\n**6\\. GSIPM courses which fulfill the LS credit requirement**\n\nThere are occasionally courses offered in GSIPM that are cross-listed between the GSIPM program schedule and LS program schedule.  Students can choose which requirement they want the course credits to fulfill: Language Studies or IPM program requirements.\n\n**7\\. TILM courses that fulfill the LS credit requirement**\n\nSome LS students may wish to take Translation and Interpretation (T&I) courses to fulfill their language component.  They may do so if 1) their LS Program Coordinator indicates that their level is at or beyond our highest course offering, and 2) they take the T&I Language Skills Test (LST) and gain approval from the relevant T&I Program Coordinator.  T&I course credits are considered as ‘credits outside of LS’, and thus, students can only earn 2 to 4 T&I credits to fulfill their requirement in the language component (see above: _5) Transfer of language credits from outside program/institution_).\n\n**G.  Instructional Hours**\n\nAll 300-level and 400-level language courses regularly meet for 4 hours a week for 15 weeks for a total of 60 hours of instruction per semester for a 4-unit course, and 2 hours a week for 15 weeks (or 4 hours a week for 7.5 weeks) for a total of 30 hours of instruction for a 2-unit course.  All 200-level courses regularly meet for 6 hours a week, 4 hours with the course professor and 2 additional hours with a Language Teaching Assistant for additional skill building, for a total of 90 hours per semester for a 4-unit course.  The time with the TA is spent doing augmentative work and is part of the required class time.  The extra 2 hours in the 200-level courses do not incur any additional charges for the students.\n\n**H. Language Specialization Certificate**\n\nA language specialization certificate may be requested when a student has completed one of the following combinations of language coursework (all units must be in a single language):\n\n**1.** 16 units of Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, or Russian at the 400-level with all grades A- or above; OR\n\n**2.** 20 units of any language at the 400-level with all grades B or above; OR\n\n**3.** 20 units of any language at any level above 300 with all grades A- or above.\n\n**I. Option to Study More Than One Language or Change Language of Study**\n\nIf students choose to take 12 credits of language courses and take 8 credits at the 400-level in a single language, they have an option of switching to another language for their 4 remaining credits, as long as they meet the minimum proficiency level requirement in the language.\n\nIf students would like to change their Language of Study while completing the 8-12 language course credits, they need to submit petition for waiver of academic regulations to the Dean of GSTILE. Approval may be given on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThose students who have their language requirement waived may elect to pursue another Language of Study (LOS) for their degree.  If they wish this new language to be listed on their transcript, they will be held to the 12-credit language/ICC requirement associated with their degree for this language.  (Students who wish to pursue additional language study without formally declaring it and listing it on their transcript are not bound by this rule.)\n\n**J.  Minimum Passing Grade for LS courses**\n\nAs long as students earn a passing grade (A to D-) for LS courses, it will count for credits necessary for graduation.  However, if students earn a grade lower than B-, they are required to repeat the same level course in the following semester, rather than advancing to the next level course.  If students earn a grade of an F, they do not receive any credits for the course.\n\n**K.  Auditing LS courses**\n\nFull-time students are entitled to audit up to 4 units per semester without charge, including any regularly offered language courses.  No audit is allowed in non-regular language courses.  Those who wish to audit must take the appropriate language placement test and receive approval from the course instructor to ensure the level equivalency with those registered for the class.  Instructor approval is required, and the instructor of the class establishes the conditions, such as attendance requirements, assignments, participation, etc., which auditors need to agree to abide.  Auditors need to register for language courses through Records Office.\n\n**L. Applying for a waiver of Language Studies credits**\n\n**1\\. Applying for a Waiver of LS credits**\n\nWhen students feel they have advanced professional proficiency in the language of their study (LOS) and no further work is desired, they may ask to take a language waiver exam to see if they can waive any language course credits (0-12) in the requirement of their language component.  Students first need to take the language placement test and be placed at the 400-level or above.  Students will then initiate application process for waiver exam by contacting the Language Studies Advisor or Language Program Coordinator.  Students must demonstrate that they possess content knowledge and professional language skills in their chosen fields.  The waiver exam consists of three stages: consultation with faculty on professional topics; research and writing of academic research paper; and an in-house 3-hour writing test, followed by an oral presentation of 30 minutes with a faculty committee.\n\n_It is important to note that obtaining a language credit waiver of any number of credits does not affect the total number of credits required to graduate in each degree program, so students may need to take other elective units in place of any language units waived._\n\n**2\\. Applying for Waiver of EAPP credits**\n\nWhen students’ LOS is English, they need to take EAPP placement test regardless of the TOEFL/IELTS scores.  However, students who demonstrate high proficiency in the EAPP placement test will be waived some of the required EAPP credits based on the result of the placement test.  In some cases, they may be waived 8-12 credits, which they can then replace with any other courses they may wish to take (e.g., other program courses, program electives, different language courses, etc.).  Those who do not receive a waiver at the time of placement test and feel their English skills have improved in subsequent semesters may apply for the EAPP waiver exam.  The EAPP waiver exam guidelines and procedure follow the other language waiver exam procedures (as above) with slight modifications.\n\n_It is important to note that obtaining a language credit waiver of any number of credits does not affect the total number of credits required to graduate in each degree program, so students may need to take other elective units in place of any language units waived._\n\n**M. MATFL Students’ Language Component**\n\nMATFL candidates have a 12-credit language component in the language of their degree pursuit.  If they are native speakers of the language, the requirement may be fulfilled by taking non-LS courses, such as Pedagogical Grammar.  If they are non-native speakers of the language they wish to teach, they need to take 12 credits of language courses at 400-level or above.\n\n**N.  Students who transfer from a TILM degree to a GSIPM degree**\n\nIf students switch from a TILM degree program, which does not have Language Studies component, to a GSIPM degree program, which has 12-credit language component, they may wish to count their TI coursework toward meeting their LS language component. They can do so under the following conditions:\n\n**1.** Students cannot ‘double-count’ the same course credits for two degrees (if pursuing a dual-degree in TILM and IPM).\n\n**2.** Students need to declare a language for their LOS, and take the LS placement test of the language.\n\n**3.** Students can use 2-4 credits of their TI courses that are A Language to B Language (productive skills) with B or above grade.\n\n**4.** If switching to the NPTS degree program, or if choosing to do 12 LS credits in the language component, students may use up to 4 credits of TI courses to fulfill the requirement of the language component.  The remaining 8 credits need to be in a single language if placed into the 300-level, but can be different languages if placed into the 400-level.\n\n**5.** If switching to the IEM degree program, or if choosing to do any ICC courses as part of the language component, then, students may use up to 2 credits of TI courses to fulfill the requirement of the language component.\n\n**O. TILM, TESOL, and special (non-degree) students who wish to take LS courses for credits**\n\nTILM and TESOL students, as well as special students (non-degree), can take LS courses as program electives.  Students who wish to take LS courses must take the LS placement test at the start of the semester and obtain approval to register for courses.  They must confirm with their academic advisor on whether or not a certain level course counts towards their program requirement/program elective.\n","excerpt":"A.  Background to the Language and ICC Component Language is central to all degree programs at the Middlebury Institute, therefore a…","html":"<p><strong>A.  Background to the Language and ICC Component</strong></p>\n<p>Language is central to all degree programs at the Middlebury Institute, therefore a Language and ICC component is included as part of the core requirements of most degree programs.  Most of our language courses are <em>content-based</em>, which means that we aim to develop field-specific content knowledge while at the same time focusing on the development of linguistic skills.</p>\n<p>All degree students except TESOL, TI, and PC MBA, have a Language and ICC component in their degree program. Students cannot take a competency exam (standardized test in the language) to bypass language study.</p>\n<p><strong>B.  Regularly Taught Languages at the Middlebury Institute</strong></p>\n<p>Arabic, Chinese (Mandarin), English, French, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish are offered as a regular part of the academic year curriculum, subject to sufficient student enrollment.</p>\n<p><strong>C.  Languages Not Regularly Taught at the Middlebury Institute</strong></p>\n<p>Requests to fulfill the language component in a language not regularly offered by the Institute must be directed <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">at the time of admission to the Middlebury Institute</span> to the Language Studies Advisor. The feasibility of offering certain language courses is assessed at the time of request, but fully determined at the time of enrollment. The non-regular language courses have the same proficiency level and credit requirement and adhere to the same standards as the other regular language courses. Applicants requesting a special language must be able to demonstrate 200-level proficiency in their requested language.  Students who request non-regular language courses should also know that setting up a course in non-regular languages will incur additional costs.</p>\n<p><strong>D. Required Language Levels</strong></p>\n<p>To enroll in Language Studies courses at the Middlebury Institute, students must have attained 200-level/second year university level/Intermediate for all languages offered.</p>\n<p>During the admission process, any students who may have insufficient proficiency to place into the LS program are required to work on Language Plans to build sufficient proficiency. If prior language study proves insufficient to meet the placement at the required levels (indicated above), students will not be allowed to begin in the language program until they acquire the minimum required proficiency in the language. <em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Note that a delay in beginning the language component of the degree program may delay graduation, and may incur additional expenses.</span></em></p>\n<p>Students whose first (native) language is a language other than English, or students who did not have secondary and post-secondary education (high school and college) in an English-speaking country, are considered to be non-native speakers of English.  They are required to take English for Academic and Professional Purposes (EAPP) courses to fulfill the requirement in the language component.</p>\n<p>Students whose first (native) language is English, or students who have had secondary and post-secondary education (high school and college) in an English-speaking environment, are considered to be native speakers of English.  EAPP courses do not count toward fulfillment of the language requirement for native speakers of English.</p>\n<p><strong>1.  Provisional Admits with low TOEFL scores</strong></p>\n<p>Non-native speakers of English who are provisionally admitted to the Middlebury Institute with TOEFL scores below the stated minimum must either obtain the required minimum score before beginning their degree programs, or enroll in (and successfully complete) English Preparation for Graduate Study (EPGS) the summer before beginning their degree programs.</p>\n<p>Some non-native speakers of English who meet the stated minimum TOEFL test scores may still be required to take 200-level EAPP courses or equivalent courses in the first semester of their degree program based on the results of the EAPP placement test.  As this coursework is below the 300-level minimum required to fulfill the language component of the degree programs, this coursework will not count toward fulfillment of the language requirement.  <em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Note that this required coursework may also delay graduation and/or incur additional expenses.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>2. Prospective/New students with Lower Language Proficiency than required</strong></p>\n<p>Prospective students who do not have sufficient language study history on their transcripts or who have outdated language coursework are required to contact the Language Study Advisor to work out a Language Plan (LP) during the admission process.  This Language Plan will lay out a concrete plan to assist in equipping students with sufficient proficiency in their chosen language (LOS) prior to enrollment in the degree programs.  <em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Failure to complete the LP may result in revoking or deferring admission.</span></em></p>\n<p>New students who take the language placement test and fail to place at the required language levels will meet with Language Studies Advisor to work out an In-Degree Language Plan (IDLP) which will determine a concrete plan and timeline for raising the student’s language proficiency to the necessary level for LS study and completing the language component of the degree program.  Registration for courses may be put on hold until students have an acceptable IDLP.</p>\n<p><strong>E. Language Studies Placement</strong></p>\n<p>Language level placement in the Language Studies (LS) program is determined by online placement tests taken just prior to Orientation week each semester. Previous language coursework is not considered for placement purposes.  Students are contacted prior to orientation with details about taking the placement tests.</p>\n<p>On the basis of placement test performance, Language Studies faculty will suggest or require certain level courses that best fit the students’ current language proficiency and development needs.  Each subsequent semester, the Language Studies instructors give pre-approval for certain courses to be taken in following semester.  The result of the placement test, or the pre-approved course placement by an LS instructor, is only honored for the particular semester that the test is taken or the pre-approval was intended. If taking a leave of absence from language study, or from MIIS, students are required to take language placement test again when they return in order to determine the course that best fits their proficiency level at the time of their return.</p>\n<p>If a student feels that he/she possesses sufficient level of professional proficiency in the language to waive some of his/her language requirement, a waiver exam can be requested. The results of the waiver exam may waive a student from 0-12 units of Language Studies courses.  (For details, please see below: <em>L.

Transferring credit from an outside institution</strong></p>\n<p>To be eligible for transfer, coursework in language or intercultural competence (ICC) must be completed <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">after</span> a student has started in the Language Studies program at MIIS, which means that s/he has taken the placement test, and has been assigned an appropriate level of study for the degree program.</p>\n<p>If a student’s degree program requires 12 credits of language study, s/he may transfer up to 4 credits of language from an outside institution. If a student’s degree program requires 8 credits of language study, s/he may transfer up to 2 credits of language from an outside institution.  Outside institutions include any accredited school/institution outside of Middlebury. Credits earned at any outside institutions and transferred to MIIS will not be calculated as part of the student’s GPA.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">The student must obtain pre-approval from the GSTILE Dean before taking courses elsewhere*.*</span>  This is achieved by submitting a petition for transfer of credit, which is reviewed by the appropriate language or ICC faculty member to determine the course’s equivalence to Institute courses that fulfill the same requirement.</p>\n<p>Students must earn a grade of B or above in in order to receive transfer credit for a course. Transfer credit will not be added to the students’ transcript until the Records Office receives an official transcript from the institution where the credit was earned.</p>\n<p><strong>b. Transferring credit from a Middlebury program</strong></p>\n<p>Normally students may transfer 2-4 credits earned in the Summer Intensive Language Program (SILP) at MIIS and/or a Middlebury Summer Language School.  Students may petition to transfer more than 2-4 credits.</p>\n<p>Up to 12 credits may be transferred if they are earned in a Middlebury School Abroad program.</p>\n<p>Students must earn a grade of B or above in order to receive credit toward the MIIS degree for a course from another Middlebury program.  Credits earned at any of the Middlebury programs that are used toward the MIIS language requirement <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">will</span> be included in the calculation of the student’s GPA.</p>\n<p><strong>c. Credits earned prior to matriculation</strong></p>\n<p>Language or ICC coursework taken prior to enrolling in the Language Studies program at MIIS is not transferrable.  The only exception is coursework taken in SILP or Middlebury’s Summer Language School in the summer <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">directly preceding</span> enrollment in the MA program.  Students may apply to use 2-4 SILP or Middlebury Summer Language School credits toward their MIIS degree.</p>\n<p><strong>6. GSIPM courses which fulfill the LS credit requirement</strong></p>\n<p>There are occasionally courses offered in GSIPM that are cross-listed between the GSIPM program schedule and LS program schedule.  Students can choose which requirement they want the course credits to fulfill: Language Studies or IPM program requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>7. TILM courses that fulfill the LS credit requirement</strong></p>\n<p>Some LS students may wish to take Translation and Interpretation (T&#x26;I) courses to fulfill their language component.  They may do so if 1) their LS Program Coordinator indicates that their level is at or beyond our highest course offering, and 2) they take the T&#x26;I Language Skills Test (LST) and gain approval from the relevant T&#x26;I Program Coordinator.  T&#x26;I course credits are considered as ‘credits outside of LS’, and thus, students can only earn 2 to 4 T&#x26;I credits to fulfill their requirement in the language component (see above: <em>5) Transfer of language credits from outside program/institution</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>G.  Instructional Hours</strong></p>\n<p>All 300-level and 400-level language courses regularly meet for 4 hours a week for 15 weeks for a total of 60 hours of instruction per semester for a 4-unit course, and 2 hours a week for 15 weeks (or 4 hours a week for 7.5 weeks) for a total of 30 hours of instruction for a 2-unit course.  All 200-level courses regularly meet for 6 hours a week, 4 hours with the course professor and 2 additional hours with a Language Teaching Assistant for additional skill building, for a total of 90 hours per semester for a 4-unit course.  The time with the TA is spent doing augmentative work and is part of the required class time.  The extra 2 hours in the 200-level courses do not incur any additional charges for the students.</p>\n<p><strong>H. Language Specialization Certificate</strong></p>\n<p>A language specialization certificate may be requested when a student has completed one of the following combinations of language coursework (all units must be in a single language):</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> 16 units of Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, or Russian at the 400-level with all grades A- or above; OR</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> 20 units of any language at the 400-level with all grades B or above; OR</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> 20 units of any language at any level above 300 with all grades A- or above.</p>\n<p><strong>I. Option to Study More Than One Language or Change Language of Study</strong></p>\n<p>If students choose to take 12 credits of language courses and take 8 credits at the 400-level in a single language, they have an option of switching to another language for their 4 remaining credits, as long as they meet the minimum proficiency level requirement in the language.</p>\n<p>If students would like to change their Language of Study while completing the 8-12 language course credits, they need to submit petition for waiver of academic regulations to the Dean of GSTILE. Approval may be given on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>Those students who have their language requirement waived may elect to pursue another Language of Study (LOS) for their degree.  If they wish this new language to be listed on their transcript, they will be held to the 12-credit language/ICC requirement associated with their degree for this language.  (Students who wish to pursue additional language study without formally declaring it and listing it on their transcript are not bound by this rule.)</p>\n<p><strong>J.  Minimum Passing Grade for LS courses</strong></p>\n<p>As long as students earn a passing grade (A to D-) for LS courses, it will count for credits necessary for graduation.  However, if students earn a grade lower than B-, they are required to repeat the same level course in the following semester, rather than advancing to the next level course.  If students earn a grade of an F, they do not receive any credits for the course.</p>\n<p><strong>K.  Auditing LS courses</strong></p>\n<p>Full-time students are entitled to audit up to 4 units per semester without charge, including any regularly offered language courses.  No audit is allowed in non-regular language courses.  Those who wish to audit must take the appropriate language placement test and receive approval from the course instructor to ensure the level equivalency with those registered for the class.  Instructor approval is required, and the instructor of the class establishes the conditions, such as attendance requirements, assignments, participation, etc., which auditors need to agree to abide.  Auditors need to register for language courses through Records Office.</p>\n<p><strong>L. Applying for a waiver of Language Studies credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Applying for a Waiver of LS credits</strong></p>\n<p>When students feel they have advanced professional proficiency in the language of their study (LOS) and no further work is desired, they may ask to take a language waiver exam to see if they can waive any language course credits (0-12) in the requirement of their language component.  Students first need to take the language placement test and be placed at the 400-level or above.  Students will then initiate application process for waiver exam by contacting the Language Studies Advisor or Language Program Coordinator.  Students must demonstrate that they possess content knowledge and professional language skills in their chosen fields.  The waiver exam consists of three stages: consultation with faculty on professional topics; research and writing of academic research paper; and an in-house 3-hour writing test, followed by an oral presentation of 30 minutes with a faculty committee.</p>\n<p><em>It is important to note that obtaining a language credit waiver of any number of credits does not affect the total number of credits required to graduate in each degree program, so students may need to take other elective units in place of any language units waived.</em></p>\n<p><strong>2. Applying for Waiver of EAPP credits</strong></p>\n<p>When students’ LOS is English, they need to take EAPP placement test regardless of the TOEFL/IELTS scores.  However, students who demonstrate high proficiency in the EAPP placement test will be waived some of the required EAPP credits based on the result of the placement test.  In some cases, they may be waived 8-12 credits, which they can then replace with any other courses they may wish to take (e.g., other program courses, program electives, different language courses, etc.).  Those who do not receive a waiver at the time of placement test and feel their English skills have improved in subsequent semesters may apply for the EAPP waiver exam.  The EAPP waiver exam guidelines and procedure follow the other language waiver exam procedures (as above) with slight modifications.</p>\n<p><em>It is important to note that obtaining a language credit waiver of any number of credits does not affect the total number of credits required to graduate in each degree program, so students may need to take other elective units in place of any language units waived.</em></p>\n<p><strong>M. MATFL Students’ Language Component</strong></p>\n<p>MATFL candidates have a 12-credit language component in the language of their degree pursuit.  If they are native speakers of the language, the requirement may be fulfilled by taking non-LS courses, such as Pedagogical Grammar.  If they are non-native speakers of the language they wish to teach, they need to take 12 credits of language courses at 400-level or above.</p>\n<p><strong>N.  Students who transfer from a TILM degree to a GSIPM degree</strong></p>\n<p>If students switch from a TILM degree program, which does not have Language Studies component, to a GSIPM degree program, which has 12-credit language component, they may wish to count their TI coursework toward meeting their LS language component. They can do so under the following conditions:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Students cannot ‘double-count’ the same course credits for two degrees (if pursuing a dual-degree in TILM and IPM).</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Students need to declare a language for their LOS, and take the LS placement test of the language.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Students can use 2-4 credits of their TI courses that are A Language to B Language (productive skills) with B or above grade.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> If switching to the NPTS degree program, or if choosing to do 12 LS credits in the language component, students may use up to 4 credits of TI courses to fulfill the requirement of the language component.  The remaining 8 credits need to be in a single language if placed into the 300-level, but can be different languages if placed into the 400-level.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> If switching to the IEM degree program, or if choosing to do any ICC courses as part of the language component, then, students may use up to 2 credits of TI courses to fulfill the requirement of the language component.</p>\n<p><strong>O. TILM, TESOL, and special (non-degree) students who wish to take LS courses for credits</strong></p>\n<p>TILM and TESOL students, as well as special students (non-degree), can take LS courses as program electives.  Students who wish to take LS courses must take the LS placement test at the start of the semester and obtain approval to register for courses.  They must confirm with their academic advisor on whether or not a certain level course counts towards their program requirement/program elective.</p>"},"c83058b7-6dce-5c65-bd92-c64833f6d8d7":{"id":"c83058b7-6dce-5c65-bd92-c64833f6d8d7","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/a-academic-policies/a-6-grades-credits-and-academic-policies/a-6-a-grades-and-credits","title":"A.6.a.

Unauthorized use of services, including dining hall meals and materials, and disposition of property to another under the pretense that it is one's own, are forms of theft.  Sanctions will include restitution or replacement and may also include disciplinary sanctions. When such theft or damage constitutes a criminal offense, it will ordinarily be reported to law enforcement authorities.</p>"},"656792fd-d182-512d-a768-2b01aa2c1918":{"id":"656792fd-d182-512d-a768-2b01aa2c1918","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/b-policies-governing-student-conduct-and-student-organizations/b-conduct/b-2-c-student-conduct-policy-overview","title":"B.2.b. Student Conduct Policy Overview","body":"\nAll members of the Middlebury Institute student community shall:\n\n- Adhere to and help maintain a high level of personal and professional behavior that is respectful of the dignity of all persons\n\n- Respect the rights and property of others\n\n- Treat equally the ideas, feelings and opinions of all students who work and study at the Institute and their right to live and study in conditions that support their work and development\n\n- Refrain from and discourage behaviors that threaten freedom and respect every individual\n\nThe Student Conduct Policy promotes a campus environment that supports the overall educational mission of the Middlebury Institute and intends to help protect the Institute community from disruption and harm, to encourage appropriate standards of individual and group behavior, and to foster ethical standards.\n\nThe Institute’s approach to policy and to addressing policy violations is guided by the above principles. Depending on their nature and severity, alleged Institute policy violations may be adjudicated and discipline may be assigned by several different administrators and the Conduct and Appeals judicial boards, as detailed in the Student Life Policies. The deans, administrators and judicial boards consider the totality of a student’s history, the impact on community, and the specific circumstances of the event when determining appropriate responses to policy violations. Consistent with the cultivation of an awareness of responsibility and accountability, students found in violation of Institute policies and/or participating in prohibited acts will be held responsible, will be subject to discipline, and/or will be charged for fines and associated costs (such as materials or labor costs for repairs; cost of impoundment; restitution, etc.) as appropriate. Students with unpaid charges may be restricted from registering for classes until their accounts are in order. Please see [Student Conduct Disciplinary Process](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/b-policies-governing-student-conduct-and-student-organizations/b-conduct/b-2-d-student-conduct-disciplinary-process) for more information.\n\nDisciplinary outcomes issued in an Institute program may be referred to any other Institute program in which the student is or will be enrolled (see “Scope of Oversight,” below). The student’s ongoing or future enrollment in any other Institute program will be determined in accordance with that program’s policies and processes. Admission to any Institute program may be denied or withdrawn based on the student’s disciplinary history at any other Institute or non-Institute program.\n\nThe policies are intended to be read broadly and are not designed to define misconduct in exhaustive terms. Attempts to commit acts prohibited in these policies may also lead to disciplinary action and sanctions.\n\n#### **A. Institute Initiated Leave of Absence, Emergency Withdrawal, Suspension, or Expulsion**\n\nIn addition to fostering the growth of its individual students, the Institute recognizes its obligation to promote the welfare of the Institute community as a whole and to take appropriate action when that welfare is jeopardized. To that end, the Institute reserves the right, notwithstanding and apart from the procedures described under [Student Conduct Disciplinary Process](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/b-policies-governing-student-conduct-and-student-organizations/b-conduct/b-2-d-student-conduct-disciplinary-process), on an emergency basis, to suspend, expel, or require a leave of absence or to withdraw any student whose presence at Institute is determined by Institute authorities (the vice president for academic affairs/dean of the Institute (VPAA/DOI); the dean of enrollment, advising and student services, the academic deans (as applicable); the associate dean of student services (ADSS); and the Threat Assessment Management Team (TAM) (as applicable)) to pose a danger to the Institute community or its members or to be unduly disruptive of Institute life, or who appears to be unwilling or incapable of effectively and/or safely participating in Institute’ academic or other programs and/or student life. In cases of emergency suspension or required withdrawal, the conditions and procedures for readmission will be determined and communicated in writing to the student at the time of the student’s departure or shortly thereafter. For more information on student status, please see Part II, Section 4 “Leaves of Absence, Withdrawal, Suspension, Expulsion and Graduation” in the Policy and Standards Manual.\n\nFaculty and administrative officials should ensure that positional authority is not used to inhibit the intellectual and personal growth of students.\n\n#### **B. Scope of Oversight**\n\nStudents will be held accountable for policy violations that take place between the time they first arrive on campus to begin their Institute program and their graduation or official program completion, or the Institute’s confirmation of their resignation or expulsion. Conduct that takes place on or near Institute premises or property; occurs at or in connection with an Institute-related event; or occurs off-campus but may represent a threat to the safety of the Institute community or its members, the pursuit of its objectives, and/or the educational environment of others, may be subject to Institute’ disciplinary process. In cases where a student is found responsible for a policy violation while participating in any Institute or non-Institute program, the finding of responsibility may also be referred to the appropriate authority overseeing any additional Institute program in which the student is or will also be enrolled for other action as deemed appropriate. This may include but is not limited to: further investigation; additional adjudication under existing policies (using only information gathered in the first disciplinary process, or using subsequently gathered information, or both, as deemed appropriate by the overseeing authority); disciplinary action; or other remedies or processes deemed appropriate by the authority overseeing the additional Institute program.\n\nStudents should report Institute employee conduct issues directly to the Human Resources Manager in the Human Resources Department at (831) 647-3520 or <a>hr@miis.edu</a>.\n\n#### **C. Pending Discipline**\n\nA student respondent will not be permitted to graduate from or otherwise be deemed to have officially completed a Institute program in which they are enrolled while a disciplinary matter is pending; the student’s graduation or certification will be held in abeyance until the matter is resolved. If a respondent withdraws with a disciplinary matter, sanction, or appeal pending, the withdrawal will be considered a resignation from the Institute, and the student will have given up the opportunity to return to any Institute program. The student’s official status at the Institute will reflect the point in the process at which they withdrew, and the nature of the finding and sanction, as appropriate. Examples include but are not limited to “Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Matter Pending,” “Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Sanction Pending,” and “Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Appeal Pending.”\n\nIn extraordinary circumstances, the appropriate supervisory authority may, after appropriate consultation, review of the case, and consideration of Institute’ best interests, grant permission for a respondent to withdraw from the Institute when a disciplinary matter is pending. If the student is readmitted to Institute, the disciplinary matter must be resolved either before the student's return, or immediately upon the student's return (as determined by the Institute).\n\n#### **D. Deadlines**\n\nSeveral Student Life policies include deadlines. Unless otherwise noted, “days” indicates calendar days, regardless of whether the majority of the Institute’s administrative offices are open. “Business days” indicates days on which the majority of Institute’ administrative offices are open, and generally connotes Mondays through Fridays. In computing any period referenced in this policy, the day of the act or event (e.g., notification of hearing, issuance of an outcome letter, etc.) from which the designated time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included if it is a business day; when not a business day, the period will conclude at the end of the next business day.\n\n#### **E. Academic Freedom**\n\nInstitute is a community of learners and as such recognizes and affirms that free intellectual inquiry, debate, and constructive dialogue are vital to the Institute’s academic mission and must be protected even when the views expressed are unpopular or controversial. The Institute’s Student Life policies are meant neither to prescribe nor to inhibit discussions, in or out of the classroom, of complex, controversial, or sensitive matters, including sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, race, color, ethnicity, religion, marital status, place of birth, ancestry, national origin, age, or disability, when in the judgment of a reasonable person they arise appropriately and are conducted with respect for the dignity of others. The Institute also recognizes that verbal conduct can be used specifically to intimidate or coerce and to inhibit genuine discourse, free inquiry, and learning. Such abuses, including but not limited to conduct that violate the Institute’s [General Conduct Policy](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/b-policies-governing-student-conduct-and-student-organizations/b-conduct/b-2-a-general-conduct-policy), [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin), and other policies are unacceptable.

Alcohol Policy (serving alcohol at events)","body":"\nThis policy affords recognized student groups, faculty, and staff the privilege of serving alcohol at certain events.  As adults, members of the MIIS community are expected to know and abide by all applicable state and federal laws and MIIS policies and procedures.  Hosting a MIIS-sanctioned event is a privilege, not a right. Ensuring the safety of all participants is central to this policy.\n\nThis policy applies to all MIIS-sanctioned events both on and off-campus.  A “sanctioned” event is one that is officially approved and registered under the auspices of a student club, Student Council or Institute department and one where student club, Student Council, department or institutional funding may be used to support the event.\n\n### <span style=\"color:#660000\">Sanctioned Events\n\n- Are requested through the Office of Student Services for student events or through the Vice President’s Office for department/institutional events.\n\n- The scheduling form clearly indicates that alcohol will be served.\n\n- For on-campus events, the Vice President’s Office has informed Campus Security that an event involving alcohol has been scheduled.\n\n- When alcohol is allowed, it can be served for a maximum of two hours. This would be an approved, predetermined time.\n\n### <span style=\"color:#660000\">On-Campus Events\n\n- Alcohol is limited to beer and wine—no hard alcohol, no exceptions.\n\n- No alcohol from the outside will be allowed to be brought into on-campus Institute events by attendees.\n\n- Regardless of the size of the event, alcohol must be served (not self-service) by an individual who is of legal age to serve alcohol (21 and over in the state of California).\n\n- Biodegradable cups will be provided by the event organizers for all events. The standard cup size will be nine ounces, with a six-ounce pour of wine or beer. Attendees are encouraged to re-use cups throughout the entire event to reduce the amount of waste. No cups from the outside will be allowed. Only one cup will be provided per guest, per event.\n\n### <span style=\"color:#660000\">Off-Campus Events\n\nNo alcohol will be allowed at MIIS-sanctioned off-campus events unless the event is held at a legitimate commercial entity (e.g., restaurant, bar, lounge).\n\n### <span style=\"color:#660000\">Responsible Contact\n\nAt least one person from the sponsoring group must be designated as the **Responsible Contact** for an event. Responsible Contacts will be sober and not consume alcohol immediately prior to or during the event.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Responsibilities:\n\n- Responsible Contacts are responsible for overseeing and facilitating the safety of the event and the implementation of this policy.\n\n- Responsible Contacts must be present for the entire event.\n\n- Responsible Contacts are to introduce themselves to Campus Security and serve as the point persons.\n\n- Responsible Contacts, **with the assistance of Campus Security as needed**, must be able to shut down an event if this policy is not being followed or if other problems arise.\n\n- Responsible Contacts will ensure food and nonalcoholic beverages will be provided at all events where alcohol is served and will be free and displayed in an attractive and easily accessible manner. Water should be one of the nonalcoholic beverages provided. The food and nonalcoholic beverages should be replenished several times throughout the program so that they are constantly available.\n\n- If the Responsible Contact is uncomfortable or unable to manage an issue, (s)he should contact Campus Security immediately for assistance. If the event is off-campus, the Responsible Contact should contact the appropriate person on site (manager, owner, etc.) to assist with any issues.\n\n- Any violations of this policy that arise at either on- and/or off-campus events should be reported to the following:\n\n  - Student club and Student Council events: [Alisyn Gruener](mailto:agruener@miis.edu) (Assistant Dean of Student Life and Engagement)[](mailto:agruener@miis.edu)\n\n  - Institutional/Departmental events: [Barbara Burke](mailto:blburke@miis.edu) ([blburke@miis.edu](mailto:blburke@miis.edu)) or the appropriate Dean\n\nRegardless of the size of the event, students and any other attendees who appear to be below the age of thirty must be required to show legal proof of age (a valid drivers license, state-issued liquor identification card, or passport) plus a MIIS ID, if applicable.\n\nAlcohol may not be served to individuals who appear to be [intoxicated](https://www.abc.ca.gov/forms/abc637.pdf). In addition, prudence dictates limiting the number of servings of alcohol per person. The consumption of more than one serving of alcohol during the course of one hour may lead to a blood alcohol concentration greater than the legal limit for driving in California. Note: because many of the Institute’s events take place in the hour before the end of the work day, we need to be especially conscious of this issue.\n\nAlcohol is prohibited in classrooms, as part of scheduled classes, and workshops. This includes semester-end parties, etc.\n\n### <span style=\"color:#660000\">Approved Events\n\nAlcohol is approved for serving at the following sanctioned events:\n\n- Vice Presidential and Institutional Advancement events\n\n- GSIPM, GSTILE, nondegree programs, and center events\n\n- Student Council social hours\n\n- Student Services events\n\n- CACS networking receptions\n\n- Commencement receptions\n\n- Alumni receptions\n\n- Receptions for large student club conferences, including but not limited to the following:\n\n  - Trade Conference\n\n  - Conflict Resolution Association\n\n  - SEGP\n\n  - International Bazaar\n  - Student Council commencement graduates’ reception (two per year)\n\n  - Others as determined by associate dean of Student Services or assistant dean of Student Life and Engagement\n\nAll other receptions/events will be approved for nonalcoholic beverages only on a case-by-case basis.\n\n### <span style=\"color:#660000\">Beverage Guidelines\n\nThe quantity of alcohol purchased for events will align with guidelines below.\n\n- One 750ml bottle of wine or sparkling water can serve four glasses based on an average six-ounce pour. Bottles of wine should be split evenly between white and red. A keg of beer contains 165 servings of beer, and pony kegs contain 82.5 servings. A 12 oz. can of soda contains 1.5 servings.\n\n- Based on a standard two hour reception, for every 50 attendees, assume that 40 guests will consume alcohol and 10 will consume non-alcoholic beverages. Suggested purchase for the event is nine bottles of red wine (36 glasses), nine bottles of white wine (36 glasses), one case of beer (24 bottles), and four large bottles of sparkling water (16 servings), one diet soda six-pack (nine servings), one soda six-pack (nine servings), and still water.\n\n- Provide enough beverages so that each guest may have two servings during the event. It is ideal if you can assess the overall demographics of the attendees and history of the group in order to estimate the amounts of beverages that will be consumed.\n\n### <span style=\"color:#660000\">Additional Policy Specific to Student Council and Student Club Events\n\nPermission to serve alcohol at a club event is a privilege, not a right. The following rules must be observed when hosting an event that has been approved for alcohol service.\n\n- The permission for distribution of alcohol at club events is at the discretion of the Assistant Dean of Student Life and Engagement or designated Student Services staff.\n\n- Club events approved to serve alcohol are restricted to members of the MIIS community (students, faculty, and staff), up to two guests per student, faculty, and staff, and approved non-MIIS invitees.\n\n- If alcohol is served no admission fee may be charged and no charge or donation for alcohol can be requested or made.\n\n- Club members must ID students, guests, faculty, and staff who are attending a club event where alcohol is being served to ensure that alcoholic beverages are not served to persons under the legal drinking age (21).\n\n- The sale of goods for the purpose of admission, the raising of funds, or the exchange of money of any kind at an event where alcohol is being served is not permitted. This constitutes the sale of alcohol, which is against the law without an issued license.\n\n- The host and/or server could have personal liability if someone is knowingly over-served and is injured or injures someone else.\n\n- The sponsoring group will be held accountable for any and all violations of this policy.\n\n- Sanctions for a violation may include, but are not limited to, loss of space reservation privileges, loss of student group recognition or club status, or fines for property damage.\n\n### <span style=\"color:#660000\">Beverage Guidelines\n\nThere are 25.4 ounces in a standard 750ml bottle of wine so you can typically get four to five glasses of wine per bottle depending upon how large of a pour per glass you are doing. A standard pour at a restaurant is just about 6 oz. In order to make your wine go further, you can pour smaller 4 oz. servings and get six servings per bottle. A bottle of champagne will serve five glasses per bottle if you have a typical 4 oz. pour.\n\nThere are 15.5 gallons (1984 ounces) in a U.S. keg of beer also known as a half-barrel. A typical serving of beer is 12 oz. so you would be able to get 165 servings from a keg. If you want to serve larger 16-ounce pints, you would only get 124 servings. There are 7.75 gallons (992 ounces) in a U.S. pony keg also known as a quarter keg. You would be able to get 82.5 servings of beer if each serving is 12 ounces. Keep in mind standards for European kegs are different from U.S. kegs.\n\nOne liter of water will serve four guests. A 12 oz. can of soda serves 1.5 glasses based on an 8 oz. serving.\n\nAs a general guideline, guests will consume 1.5 glasses of beverages during the first hour of an event and one drink during subsequent hours. If you are having a reception lasting two hours, estimating two to three beverages per person will be sufficient and ensure you will not run out. If you are having a reception followed by a dinner, you can estimate one drink during the reception and two glasses during the dinner. It can be difficult to determine the amounts of each type of beverage as each group and each event is different. The more choices you provide, the more complicated estimating becomes. Generally, 80 percent of guests will drink alcohol and 20 percent will select a nonalcoholic beverage. For those partaking in an alcoholic beverage, generally 80 percent will select wine and 20 percent beer. Example, if you planning a two-hour reception for 100 guests, you can estimate that 80 guests will select an alcoholic beverage and 20 guests will select a nonalcoholic beverage. Assume 60 guests will drink wine, 20 will drink beer, and 20 will have water/soda. It would be wise to purchase 1.5 cases of red wine (72 glasses of red) and 1.5 cases of white wine (72 glasses of white), which will give you 36 bottles equivalent to 144 glasses allowing each of the 60 guests to have two to three glasses of wine during the event. Two cases of beer (equivalent to 48 bottles) are sufficient to serve 20 guests. Eight bottles of sparkling water is recommended (32 servings), along with two 12-packs of soda (one diet 18 servings and one regular 18 servings). The above example gives you a total of 260 servings (68 nonalcoholic and 192 alcoholic servings).\n\nIt is ideal if you can assess the overall demographics of the attendees in order to estimate the amounts of beverages that will be consumed (e.g., younger group of men may consume a higher quantity of beer than an older group of women.) However, never plan to over-serve any guest alcohol. As noted in the above guidelines, you cannot serve guests who appear to be intoxicated. The nature of the event should also be considered (is it happy hour or dinner?) and time of year (more red wine is consumed in the winter). If the history of the group is available, that will be ideal when estimating amounts of beverages. Generally speaking, white wine tends to be more popular than red wine; however, again it depends upon the guests' preferences, which can be difficult to assess in advance.

Ensuring the safety of all participants is central to this policy.</p>\n<p>This policy applies to all MIIS-sanctioned events both on and off-campus.  A “sanctioned” event is one that is officially approved and registered under the auspices of a student club, Student Council or Institute department and one where student club, Student Council, department or institutional funding may be used to support the event.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#660000\">Sanctioned Events</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Are requested through the Office of Student Services for student events or through the Vice President’s Office for department/institutional events.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The scheduling form clearly indicates that alcohol will be served.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For on-campus events, the Vice President’s Office has informed Campus Security that an event involving alcohol has been scheduled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When alcohol is allowed, it can be served for a maximum of two hours.

The standard cup size will be nine ounces, with a six-ounce pour of wine or beer.

Responsible Contacts will be sober and not consume alcohol immediately prior to or during the event.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Responsibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Responsible Contacts are responsible for overseeing and facilitating the safety of the event and the implementation of this policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Responsible Contacts must be present for the entire event.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Responsible Contacts are to introduce themselves to Campus Security and serve as the point persons.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Responsible Contacts, <strong>with the assistance of Campus Security as needed</strong>, must be able to shut down an event if this policy is not being followed or if other problems arise.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Responsible Contacts will ensure food and nonalcoholic beverages will be provided at all events where alcohol is served and will be free and displayed in an attractive and easily accessible manner.

In addition, prudence dictates limiting the number of servings of alcohol per person. The consumption of more than one serving of alcohol during the course of one hour may lead to a blood alcohol concentration greater than the legal limit for driving in California. Note: because many of the Institute’s events take place in the hour before the end of the work day, we need to be especially conscious of this issue.</p>\n<p>Alcohol is prohibited in classrooms, as part of scheduled classes, and workshops. This includes semester-end parties, etc.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#660000\">Approved Events</h3>\n<p>Alcohol is approved for serving at the following sanctioned events:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Vice Presidential and Institutional Advancement events</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GSIPM, GSTILE, nondegree programs, and center events</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Student Council social hours</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Student Services events</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CACS networking receptions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Commencement receptions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alumni receptions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Receptions for large student club conferences, including but not limited to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Trade Conference</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conflict Resolution Association</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SEGP</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>International Bazaar</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Student Council commencement graduates’ reception (two per year)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Others as determined by associate dean of Student Services or assistant dean of Student Life and Engagement</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All other receptions/events will be approved for nonalcoholic beverages only on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#660000\">Beverage Guidelines</h3>\n<p>The quantity of alcohol purchased for events will align with guidelines below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>One 750ml bottle of wine or sparkling water can serve four glasses based on an average six-ounce pour. Bottles of wine should be split evenly between white and red. A keg of beer contains 165 servings of beer, and pony kegs contain 82.5 servings. A 12 oz. can of soda contains 1.5 servings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Based on a standard two hour reception, for every 50 attendees, assume that 40 guests will consume alcohol and 10 will consume non-alcoholic beverages. Suggested purchase for the event is nine bottles of red wine (36 glasses), nine bottles of white wine (36 glasses), one case of beer (24 bottles), and four large bottles of sparkling water (16 servings), one diet soda six-pack (nine servings), one soda six-pack (nine servings), and still water.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide enough beverages so that each guest may have two servings during the event. It is ideal if you can assess the overall demographics of the attendees and history of the group in order to estimate the amounts of beverages that will be consumed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#660000\">Additional Policy Specific to Student Council and Student Club Events</h3>\n<p>Permission to serve alcohol at a club event is a privilege, not a right. The following rules must be observed when hosting an event that has been approved for alcohol service.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The permission for distribution of alcohol at club events is at the discretion of the Assistant Dean of Student Life and Engagement or designated Student Services staff.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Club events approved to serve alcohol are restricted to members of the MIIS community (students, faculty, and staff), up to two guests per student, faculty, and staff, and approved non-MIIS invitees.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If alcohol is served no admission fee may be charged and no charge or donation for alcohol can be requested or made.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Club members must ID students, guests, faculty, and staff who are attending a club event where alcohol is being served to ensure that alcoholic beverages are not served to persons under the legal drinking age (21).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The sale of goods for the purpose of admission, the raising of funds, or the exchange of money of any kind at an event where alcohol is being served is not permitted. This constitutes the sale of alcohol, which is against the law without an issued license.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The host and/or server could have personal liability if someone is knowingly over-served and is injured or injures someone else.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The sponsoring group will be held accountable for any and all violations of this policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sanctions for a violation may include, but are not limited to, loss of space reservation privileges, loss of student group recognition or club status, or fines for property damage.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#660000\">Beverage Guidelines</h3>\n<p>There are 25.4 ounces in a standard 750ml bottle of wine so you can typically get four to five glasses of wine per bottle depending upon how large of a pour per glass you are doing. A standard pour at a restaurant is just about 6 oz. In order to make your wine go further, you can pour smaller 4 oz. servings and get six servings per bottle. A bottle of champagne will serve five glasses per bottle if you have a typical 4 oz. pour.</p>\n<p>There are 15.5 gallons (1984 ounces) in a U.S. keg of beer also known as a half-barrel. A typical serving of beer is 12 oz. so you would be able to get 165 servings from a keg. If you want to serve larger 16-ounce pints, you would only get 124 servings. There are 7.75 gallons (992 ounces) in a U.S. pony keg also known as a quarter keg. You would be able to get 82.5 servings of beer if each serving is 12 ounces. Keep in mind standards for European kegs are different from U.S. kegs.</p>\n<p>One liter of water will serve four guests. A 12 oz. can of soda serves 1.5 glasses based on an 8 oz. serving.</p>\n<p>As a general guideline, guests will consume 1.5 glasses of beverages during the first hour of an event and one drink during subsequent hours. If you are having a reception lasting two hours, estimating two to three beverages per person will be sufficient and ensure you will not run out. If you are having a reception followed by a dinner, you can estimate one drink during the reception and two glasses during the dinner. It can be difficult to determine the amounts of each type of beverage as each group and each event is different. The more choices you provide, the more complicated estimating becomes. Generally, 80 percent of guests will drink alcohol and 20 percent will select a nonalcoholic beverage. For those partaking in an alcoholic beverage, generally 80 percent will select wine and 20 percent beer. Example, if you planning a two-hour reception for 100 guests, you can estimate that 80 guests will select an alcoholic beverage and 20 guests will select a nonalcoholic beverage. Assume 60 guests will drink wine, 20 will drink beer, and 20 will have water/soda. It would be wise to purchase 1.5 cases of red wine (72 glasses of red) and 1.5 cases of white wine (72 glasses of white), which will give you 36 bottles equivalent to 144 glasses allowing each of the 60 guests to have two to three glasses of wine during the event. Two cases of beer (equivalent to 48 bottles) are sufficient to serve 20 guests. Eight bottles of sparkling water is recommended (32 servings), along with two 12-packs of soda (one diet 18 servings and one regular 18 servings). The above example gives you a total of 260 servings (68 nonalcoholic and 192 alcoholic servings).</p>\n<p>It is ideal if you can assess the overall demographics of the attendees in order to estimate the amounts of beverages that will be consumed (e.g., younger group of men may consume a higher quantity of beer than an older group of women.) However, never plan to over-serve any guest alcohol. As noted in the above guidelines, you cannot serve guests who appear to be intoxicated. The nature of the event should also be considered (is it happy hour or dinner?) and time of year (more red wine is consumed in the winter). If the history of the group is available, that will be ideal when estimating amounts of beverages. Generally speaking, white wine tends to be more popular than red wine; however, again it depends upon the guests' preferences, which can be difficult to assess in advance. If in doubt, it is safe to do a split of red and white.</p>\n<p>(Assistant Dean of Student Life and Engagement)</p>"},"1046a099-21aa-5db4-b7f8-bd5edde73c53":{"id":"1046a099-21aa-5db4-b7f8-bd5edde73c53","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/b-policies-governing-student-conduct-and-student-organizations/d-student-clubs-and-organizations/b-4-e-guest-policy","title":"B.4.e.

The ADSS may also issue additional restrictions of the Institute’s privileges, including but not limited to participation in student life activities, clubs, student council or guest privileges, and assign educational sanctions, including but not limited to reparative community service, as appropriate. Students may appeal the issuance of a letter of official discipline by ADSS to the Conduct Judicial Board; they may not appeal unofficial sanctions.\n\nThe ADSS may additionally issue sanctions of suspension or expulsion through the Disposition without Hearing process (see [Hearing Procedures](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/b-policies-governing-student-conduct-and-student-organizations/b-conduct/b-2-d-student-conduct-disciplinary-process/c-hearing-procedures)), as well as other academic sanctions as noted (see [Sanctions for Academic Offenses](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/b-policies-governing-student-conduct-and-student-organizations/b-conduct/b-2-d-student-conduct-disciplinary-process/e-sanctions-for-academic-offenses)). In the case of suspension or expulsion, the ADSS will consult with the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Institute (VPAA/DOI) prior to issuing the sanction. The dean of enrollment, advising and student services may issue sanctions of suspension through the Disposition without a Final Determination process (see [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin)).

See “[Section B. The Judicial System](/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/b-policies-governing-student-conduct-and-student-organizations/b-conduct/b-2-d-student-conduct-disciplinary-process/b-the-judicial-system)” for more information on the Conduct Judicial Board.\n\n#### **1. “No-Contact” Orders**\n\nWhen a verbal or physical altercation, sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking, harassment, discrimination, retaliation, or hazing has been alleged, or when otherwise deemed appropriate under the circumstances, the ADSS or the human relations officers (HROs), have the authority to issue No Contact Orders to the persons involved, whether or not disciplinary action is taken. A No Contact Order is used to restrict encounters and communications between individuals. While a No Contact Order is not a disciplinary sanction, and will not appear on a student’s disciplinary record, refusal to adhere to the order after written or verbal notification of its terms is prohibited and may result in disciplinary action.\n\n#### **2. Legal Proceedings**\n\nThe Institute’s disciplinary action is distinct from and not dependent upon the outcome of any legal proceedings involving a student, although conduct that forms the basis for legal proceedings may also warrant disciplinary action by the Institute, and conviction of a crime may in itself justify disciplinary action. If the Institute determines that a complaint will not be heard on campus, there may be an avenue for redress through legal action (civil and/or criminal).\n\nThe Institute may offer assistance to a student facing civil or criminal legal proceedings by apprising the student of sources of legal counsel, for example, but the Institute will endeavor not to interfere in any such proceedings. Students should also be aware that Institute officials and other students may, like all persons, be compelled to give testimony or evidence if subject to the subpoena power of a court.\n\nWhile students are enrolled at the Institute, they must inform the Institute of any occasion on which they are charged with a felony by state or federal authorities. Failure to do so may itself result in disciplinary action.\n\n#### **3. Conduct Judicial Board and Other Procedures**\n\nAll parties will be provided procedural rights as outlined in the section or as outlined in our [Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic and Dating Violence and Misconduct, and Stalking](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/smdvs), or [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin), as applicable. Alleged violations of the Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic and Dating Violence and Misconduct, and Stalking and the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy are adjudicated through separate processes; please consult those policies for more information. Since the Institute lacks full judicial authority, such as the power to subpoena or place witnesses under oath, a student's rights cannot be coextensive with or identical to the rights afforded in a civil or criminal legal proceeding. However, the procedures outlined in the section and in the Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic and Dating Violence and Misconduct and Stalking and the Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy are designed to provide fundamental fairness and to protect students from arbitrary or capricious disciplinary action. The Conduct Judicial Board, the ADSS, the HROs and other disciplinary authorities at the Institute shall conduct their proceedings in the spirit of these principles.

The responsibilities of the hearing chair include facilitating the hearing and deliberations process, and making evidentiary and procedural decisions during the hearing as described below. The chair of the Conduct Judicial Board for academic allegation hearings will be the dean of enrollment, advising and student services. There is no co-chair for academic-related hearings.\n\nA faculty member who believes a student has engaged in academic dishonesty shall submit a written statement of the facts supporting the allegations to the ADSS, for transmittal to the Conduct Judicial Board.

Normally, the hearing will be scheduled no more than two weeks after the ADSS’ official letter of allegations has been provided to the student. Shorter deadlines may apply in cases involving students at the end of their final term, or with the agreement of the respondent(s). The faculty member initiating allegations shall participate in the hearing to explain them and to ask and answer questions. The faculty member and the respondent may each be accompanied by an adviser of their choosing from the Institute community.\n\nFor non-academic allegation hearings, a staff or faculty co-chair is identified the ADSS on a per hearing basis.

Hearing Procedures","body":"\n#### 1. **Allegations**\n\nStudents will be held accountable for policy violations that take place between the time they first arrive on campus to begin their Institute program and their graduation, or the Institute’s confirmation of their resignation or expulsion.\n\nThe ADSS or designee, in consultation as appropriate, will determine when and whether policy violation allegations will result in judicial hearings, and will identify those Institute policies that may have been violated. The person or group initiating an allegation is called the complainant; in most cases, the Institute serves as the complainant, although the Institute may choose not to exercise the full rights of a complainant as defined below. The student responding to allegations is called the respondent. All official allegations of policy violations are transmitted to the respondent through the ADSS on behalf of the Institute. Prior to the hearing, the respondent will be notified of the identity of the complainant and the names of any witnesses who will attend the proceedings. Respondents will be provided with a general statement of allegations, including identification of the alleged policy violations under consideration, and will have access to all hearing materials that will be shared with the board in advance of the hearing.\n\n#### 2. **Disposition without Hearing**\n\nUpon receiving written notification of the allegations, respondents who do not contest them may request that the ADSS adjudicate their final and official disposition rather than pursuing adjudication through a judicial board hearing. In circumstances where the ADSS determines that disposition without hearing is not in the best interests of the Institute community, the request will be denied and the case will proceed to a hearing. In cases where disposition without hearing is permitted, the ADSS will propose a sanction appropriate to the acknowledged violation which approximates the sanction the ADSS believes the judicial board would assign with the same information. The respondent may accept the sanction, or may reject it, in which case the allegations will be adjudicated by the appropriate judicial board, and the board’s finding and sanction will apply. The ADSS will set a reasonable deadline by which the respondent must choose to accept the sanction or reject it and pursue a hearing.\n\n#### 3. **Administration of Hearings**\n\nThe ADSS serves as a procedural advisor and secretary to the judicial boards. The ADSS assists with scheduling, provides required notices to the parties, witnesses, and board members, identifies the materials to be included in the hearing and provides access to them to the parties and board members as appropriate, identifies and approves witnesses, and otherwise performs administrative functions for the board. The ADSS does not participate in the deliberations of the board, but may be present during deliberations to assist with administrative tasks and provide procedural guidelines.\n\n#### 4. **Notification of Hearing**\n\nNotification in writing will be given to the respondent, the complainant, and any known witnesses called by the ADSS. Notification will include the time and place of the hearing and must be given to the complainant and respondent at least two business days in advance of the hearing. In most instances, the hearing will be scheduled not more than two weeks after the official transmission of the allegations, except where exigent circumstances require otherwise.\n\n#### 5\\. **Attendance at Hearings**\n\nThe respondent, complainant, and all required witnesses are expected to be present at the time and place of the scheduled hearing. Failure to appear at a scheduled hearing after proper notice may subject a student to disciplinary penalties up to and including suspension. Judicial proceedings take precedence over academic and nonacademic activities, and students shall be excused from other obligations to participate in the proceedings. Should a respondent who has been properly charged and notified of a scheduled hearing fail to appear, the hearing may proceed and sanctions may be imposed as if the respondent were present.\n\n#### 6\\. **Disqualification**\n\nAny member of a judicial body who has a conflict of interest in a particular proceeding is disqualified from sitting on that case. If a member of the Conduct Judicial Board or the Judicial Appeals Board is disqualified, normally an alternate member from the same constituency will be selected to participate.\n\n#### 7. **Quorum**\n\nConduct Judicial Board hearings may not be conducted with fewer than three members. Three votes are needed for a finding of responsibility for a policy violation. In the event of a finding of responsibility for a policy violation, sanctions shall be determined by majority vote.\n\nJudicial Appeals Board hearings may not be conducted with fewer than three members, at least one of whom is a student, present. In the event of a finding of responsibility for a policy violation, sanctions shall be determined by majority vote.\n\n#### 8. **Audio Recording**\n\nAll judicial hearings will be audio recorded. The recording is the property of the Institute. In the event of an appeal, the recording will be available for the consideration of the appeal, as well as to the respondent. Copies made for the respondent must be returned once the appeal is filed and may not be used for other purposes.\n\n#### 9. **Participation in Judicial Proceedings**\n\nNormally, participation in or attendance at judicial hearings shall be limited to students and employees of the Institute. When others are involved in a case or can offer testimony that is directly relevant, the ADSS may permit those individuals to participate in a hearing.\n\n#### 10. **Expectations**\n\nHonesty is expected on the part of all members of the community who participate in the judicial process. The provision of false or misleading information to a judicial body may itself be grounds for disciplinary action.\n\n#### 11. **Support Person**\n\nThe respondent and the complainant may each bring a support person who is a student or employee of the Institute. This person may be consulted by the respondent/complainant during the hearing, but, unless specifically invited, may not otherwise participate in the proceedings. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, each respondent and complainant shall provide the ADSS with the names of persons serving as their support person. The names will be shared with the both parties.\n\n#### 12. **Character Reference**\n\nComplainants and respondents may each submit one character reference. If this individual is sharing their reference in person, the individual must be an Institute student or employee. If the individual is providing a letter of reference and is not appearing in person, they may submit the reference to the ADSS, who will read it to the board on the author’s behalf. Individuals submitting reference letters are not restricted to the Institute community membership. Character references may not exceed ten minutes in length (in-person references) or five pages of double-spaced 12-point text (letters of reference), and may not contain any content that refers directly to the incident under investigation or provide evidential testimony.\n\n#### 13. **Independent Expertise**\n\nIf the case involves a technical matter that falls outside the expertise of the members of the judicial body, the ADSS may invite an appropriate individual who possesses expertise relevant to the matter at hand to provide technical assistance to the board during the hearing.\n\n#### 14. **Rights of the Respondent**\n\nThe respondent has the right to be present throughout the hearing and to hear adverse testimony. In no case should the board consider evidence against a student unless the source, author, and content of any statement or other evidence has been identified to the student, and the student has been given the opportunity to rebut the statement or respond to the evidence. All written evidence intended to be introduced at the hearing must be provided to ADSS prior to the commencement of the hearing. Once the hearing begins, the chair reserves the right not to consider written evidence not provided in advance. Sanctions may only be imposed for the specific allegations of which the student has been notified in writing.\n\n#### 15. **Evidence Rulings**\n\nRules of evidence applicable in court proceedings do not apply in this process. The evidentiary materials and testimony may include information that the members of the board ultimately deem to be immaterial. The parties are invited to comment on the relevance, weight and substance of the evidence throughout the hearing. The evaluation of evidence by the members of the board includes consideration of its relevance, materiality, and credibility. In cases where evidentiary or procedural questions arise in connection with the hearing, the ADSS will make rulings prior to the hearing, and the chair of the judicial body shall make rulings on that arise in hearings. A decision of the chair may be modified by a majority vote.\n\n#### 16. **Burden of Proof**\n\nThe burden of proof rests with the party bringing the allegation.\n\n#### 17. **Basis of Decision**\n\nIn determining whether a policy has been violated, the board shall base its decision only on evidence introduced at the hearing of that case. Policy violation determinations will be made on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence; that is, after assessing all evidence for its relevance, weight and substance, whether it is more likely than not that the violation occurred.\n\n#### 18. **Hearings**\n\nAll hearings are confidential, and all board members are committed to maintaining the privacy of the involved parties by refusing to disclose or discuss the content of a hearing outside of the confines of the hearing itself. All complainants, respondents, advisors, character references, witnesses and other participants are asked to do the same.\n\n#### 19. **Confidential Deliberations**\n\nAll judicial board deliberations are confidential.\n\n#### 20. **Decision**\n\nThe ADSS will normally provide written notification of the decision to each respondent within two business days of the board’s determination. Failure to meet the time limitations in this section will not invalidate a decision.\n\n#### 21. **Record of Proceedings**\n\nIf a judicial proceeding results in a finding of no responsibility for any policy violation, there will be no record of the allegations or the hearing in the student's permanent official file.\n","excerpt":"1.

A decision of the chair may be modified by a majority vote.</p>\n<h4>16. <strong>Burden of Proof</strong></h4>\n<p>The burden of proof rests with the party bringing the allegation.</p>\n<h4>17. <strong>Basis of Decision</strong></h4>\n<p>In determining whether a policy has been violated, the board shall base its decision only on evidence introduced at the hearing of that case. Policy violation determinations will be made on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence; that is, after assessing all evidence for its relevance, weight and substance, whether it is more likely than not that the violation occurred.</p>\n<h4>18. <strong>Hearings</strong></h4>\n<p>All hearings are confidential, and all board members are committed to maintaining the privacy of the involved parties by refusing to disclose or discuss the content of a hearing outside of the confines of the hearing itself. All complainants, respondents, advisors, character references, witnesses and other participants are asked to do the same.</p>\n<h4>19. <strong>Confidential Deliberations</strong></h4>\n<p>All judicial board deliberations are confidential.</p>\n<h4>20. <strong>Decision</strong></h4>\n<p>The ADSS will normally provide written notification of the decision to each respondent within two business days of the board’s determination. Failure to meet the time limitations in this section will not invalidate a decision.</p>\n<h4>21. <strong>Record of Proceedings</strong></h4>\n<p>If a judicial proceeding results in a finding of no responsibility for any policy violation, there will be no record of the allegations or the hearing in the student's permanent official file.</p>"},"eeb869d7-f237-50e1-9abf-c7284bbbf75d":{"id":"eeb869d7-f237-50e1-9abf-c7284bbbf75d","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/b-policies-governing-student-conduct-and-student-organizations/b-conduct/b-2-d-student-conduct-disciplinary-process/d-sanctions-for-general-non-academic-offenses","title":"D. Sanctions for General Non-Academic Offenses","body":"\nSanctions for students found responsible for committing non-academic policy violations are listed below. Sanctions are designed to accomplish several goals to deter harmful conduct; to cultivate responsibility and accountability to self and others; to address the underlying harm including the wellbeing or safety of any individual and/or the community; to eliminate any hostile environment, prevent its recurrence, and correct its discriminatory effects on the complainant and others, if applicable; and to provide other appropriate forms of redress.\n\nSanctions are recorded in the student's file, and are not reflected on the academic transcript, except that Institute enrollment dates are part of the transcript record. Sanctions that constitute a form of official discipline, as noted below, are included in a student’s permanent record and may/must be disclosed by the respondent and/or by the Institute under certain circumstances.\n\nSanctions may additionally include loss or restriction of Institute privileges and/or educational/reparative assignments as appropriate. Prior conduct and judicial history may be taken into account in determining sanctions. Receipt of sanctions may also impact future Institute opportunities, including but not limited to employment, leadership position selection, or approval for participation in other Institute programs.\n\nIf the conduct occurred during the course and scope of the student’s employment at the Institute, the matter will be referred to the Human Resources Department, as appropriate, for disciplinary sanctions that may include written reprimands, or termination of employment in addition to the sanctions assigned through the judicial process.\n\nAlthough discipline is cumulative at the Institute, which may result in greater sanctions for repeated or accumulated violations, it is not progressive. That is, depending on the severity of the violation, a student may receive any of the sanctions below, even for a first offense. Sanctions for offenses involving alcohol and/or drugs will be assigned to be consistent with those outlined below and in the Alcohol and Drug Use Policy.\n\nThe sanctions below are listed in order of increasing severity.\n\n#### **1. Unofficial Forms of Discipline**\n\n#### **<span style=\"color:#660000\">a. Warnings</span>**\n\nA verbal or written warning may be issued when a student has violated Institute policy. A warning is intended to educate the student about Institute policies and/or state laws, and the need to adhere to them. A warning is informal, unofficial discipline and is not part of the student's official record. Students who receive a warning can answer negatively if they are asked if they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Institute program. Warnings are taken into account in determining future disciplinary outcomes and may serve to make further violations of Institute regulations more serious.\n\n#### **<span style=\"color:#660000\">b. Reprimands</span>**\n\nA letter of reprimand may be issued when a student demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to abide by our principles and by repeatedly violating Institute policy. A letter of reprimand may also be issued when a student has committed a violation of the Institute policy that has had or may have had a negative impact on an individual or on the community. A reprimand registers strongly the Institute’s concern regarding the student’s actions and its firm expectations for immediate improved behavior.\n\nA letter of reprimand is informal, unofficial discipline and is not part of the student’s official record. Students who receive reprimands can answer negatively if they are asked if they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Institute program. Reprimands are taken into account in determining future disciplinary outcomes and may serve to make further violations of Institute regulations more serious.\n\n#### **<span style=\"color:#660000\">c. Probationary Status</span>**\n\nStudents may be placed on probationary status when the number or nature of their Institute policy violation(s) is sufficiently concerning that an additional policy violation will most likely result in an official form of discipline (please see below). Probationary status provides students with an opportunity to avoid this outcome. They may do so by demonstrating improved conduct, generally reflected in their sustained ability to respect community standards and adhere to Institute policies.\n\nIf students commit new policy violations while on probationary status, an appropriate course of action will be determined. Considerations may include the gravity and impact of the new infraction; the student’s response during and following the new infraction; and the student’s progress during the probationary period.\n\nProbationary status is informal, unofficial discipline and is not part of the student’s official record. Students who are placed on probationary status can answer negatively if they are asked if they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Institute program. It is important to note that discipline is cumulative at the Institute and further infractions following the successful conclusion of the probationary period may still result in more severe outcomes.\n\n#### **2\\. Official Forms of Discipline**\n\n#### **<span style=\"color:#660000\">a. Letter of Official Discipline</span>**\n\nStudents may receive a letter of official discipline when their actions have demonstrated disregard for the Institute’s policies such that an additional infraction of Institute policy will most likely result in suspension from the Institute. A letter of official discipline is intended to encourage immediate improved behavior and acceptance of responsibility and growth by establishing this incident on the student's permanent record.\n\nLetters of official discipline are a permanent part of the student's official record. Students who receive a letter of official discipline must answer affirmatively if they are asked whether they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Institute program.\n\n#### **<span style=\"color:#660000\">b. Suspension</span>**\n\nSuspension is issued when a student commits a serious policy violation, or repeatedly violates Institute policy, thereby demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to behave in a manner consistent with Institute principles. The behavior is sufficiently egregious that the student is required to leave the Institute community for a period of time. It is intended to encourage acceptance of responsibility and growth by establishing this incident on the student's permanent record; to provide the student with an opportunity to consider and address the problematic behavior; and to develop strategies to ensure that the student’s eventual return to the Institute will be successful for the student, for the individuals affected by the student's actions, and for the community.\n\nSuspension may be imposed for any length of time, but is normally imposed for a period no longer than one academic year. In determining the length of suspension, the sanctioning authority will consider the student’s prior conduct history; the gravity of the violation and its impact on the community; the needs of the complainant/affected party; and the need for sufficient time for the student to demonstrate that the concerning behavior has been satisfactorily addressed. When the sanctioning authority feels that suspension for one academic year is insufficient to allow for a student’s successful return to the community, expulsion will be the normal outcome, barring exceptional circumstances.\n\nStudents who are suspended for four weeks or longer who wish to return to or be reinstated at the Institute must apply for readmission or reinstatement. Students must apply through the dean of their school/ program. All applicants for readmission or reinstatement after suspension must demonstrate readiness to return to the Institute. Readiness to return is determined by a student’s adherence to the terms of the sanction and the deadlines of the readmission process; by the completion of any additional conditions that may have been established at the time of the student’s departure; and by the provision of satisfactory evidence that the problematic behavior will not recur. If a student is unable to demonstrate readiness to return at the stated conclusion of the period of suspension, the appropriate supervisory authority may deny readmission or reinstatement until it is satisfied that the conditions that led to the student’s departure have been appropriately addressed.\n\nSuspension is a form of official discipline and is a permanent part of the student's record. Students who are suspended must answer affirmatively if they are asked whether they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Institute program. Students who are suspended must leave campus; are restricted from all Institute-owned or rented properties; and are prohibited from participating in all Institute activities or programs, from employment by the Institute, and from using Institute facilities during the stated period of the suspension. When suspension prohibits students from completing a semester or program they have already begun, the comprehensive fee for that semester or program is not refunded. For international students, suspension may affect immigration status; related questions may be directed to the director of international student and scholar services.\n\n#### **<span style=\"color:#660000\">c. Expulsion</span>**\n\nFor particularly serious offenses, students may be permanently expelled from the Institute. In cases of expulsion from the Institute, no refund of the comprehensive fee or other program fee, as applicable, is made. Expulsion is a form of official discipline and is a permanent part of the student's record. Students who are expelled must answer affirmatively if they are asked whether they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Institute program.\n\nFines or restitution commensurate with the nature of the offense may also be assigned. The monetary cost of the harm done may be taken into account in assessment of a fine or an order of restitution.\n\nA sanction of suspension or expulsion is ordinarily stayed pending the outcome of any authorized appeal. However, if the judicial authority which imposed this sanction makes a finding that imminent danger to one or more members of the Institute community may exist, suspension or expulsion will take effect immediately regardless of the pendency of an appeal.

Appeals of Conduct Judicial Board Outcomes**\n\nA student found responsible by the Conduct Judicial Board of violating MIIS policy has the right of appeal to the VPAA/DOI on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n- discovery of significant new factual material not available to the board with original jurisdiction that could have affected the result; however, prior omission of factual information that the student knew or should reasonably have known about is not a ground for an appeal;\n- procedural error where the error prevented fundamental fairness;\n- abuse of discretion in the issuance of a sanction, meaning that the board imposed a sanction significantly disproportionate to the offense.\n\nIf any of the appeal grounds above are present, the VPAA/DOI or designee, in consultation with other relevant individuals (if needed) may identify the appropriate process for further adjudication. In cases where none of the appeals grounds have been met, the VPAA/DOI may deny the appeal.\n\n#### **2. Procedures**\n\nA student found responsible for a Middlebury policy violation by the Conduct Judicial Board, may appeal the decision by submitting a written appeal to the VPAA/DOI within 10 business days of receipt of written notification of the board’s decision. The written notification must include evidence and/or arguments they believe support any of the three grounds for appeal listed above, and their explanation of the evidence or arguments.\n\nThe VPAA/DOI shall provide a copy of the written appeal to the ADSS, who will provide the records from the case to the VPAA/DOI. The VPAA/DOI may consult with the ADSS and any other relevant individual regarding the appeal as appropriate.\n\nThe VPAA/DOI, in consultation with other relevant individuals (if needed) will make a determination whether the grounds for appeal are present, and if so, what kind of reconsideration is appropriate to address them. This may include reconvening the original board, or referring the matter to the Judicial Appeals Board, as appropriate. This may also include but is not limited to a full rehearing; a limited rehearing; or new outcome and/or sanction deliberations. Notification of the VPAA/DOI's decision will be given to the student within 15 business days of receipt by the VPAA/DOI of the complete records in the case, but failure to meet this notification deadline will not invalidate a decision.\n\nUpon notice from the VPAA/DOI that reconsideration of some kind has been granted, the administrative co-chair of the Judicial Appeals Board will convene the Judicial Appeals Board. It is the responsibility of the VPAA/DOI, in consultation with other relevant individuals (if needed) to determine which aspects of the case merit reconsideration and what procedures should be followed, and to direct the Judicial Appeals Board accordingly. When a full or limited rehearing has been granted, notice will be given to those involved of the date, time, and place of rehearing, which shall be held within ten business days of the notice that the rehearing has been granted, absent exigent circumstances.\n\nFor periods of the academic year when MIIS is not in regular session, dates for addressing judicial matters will be scheduled at the discretion of the ADSS.\n\n#### **3\\. Finality for All Appeals**\n\n- If reconsideration is not granted, the original decision stands to take effect as of the date specified in the decision letter.\n- All penalties are suspended during an appeal, except in emergency circumstances as discussed above.\n- The board hearing an appeal may reverse a decision or mitigate sanctions, but may not increase a sanction.\n- Decisions by the VPAA/DOI and the board hearing an appeal are final.\n\n</div>\n","excerpt":"Appeals are reviewed by different Institute officials and adjudicators than those who reached the initial decisions. 1.
