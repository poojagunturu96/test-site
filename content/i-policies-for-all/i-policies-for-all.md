The freedom to teach and learn depends upon the creation of appropriate conditions and opportunities on the campus as a whole as well as in classrooms and lecture halls. All members of the academic community share the responsibility for securing and sustaining the general conditions conducive to this freedom.

The primary purposes of regulations and discipline in an academic community are to protect the well-being of the community and to advance its educational mission by defining and establishing certain norms of behavior.
