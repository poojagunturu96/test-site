title: "D.1. Stewarding Middlebury Resources and Financial Policies"
---

Middlebury's principal revenue sources are from students (tuition, board, and room) and from donors (individuals, foundations, and industry). These funds are given with the expectation that they advance the educational mission of Middlebury. The [Executive Vice President for Finance & Administration](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/administration/vpfin/finance-office/controller/policies) controls the expenditure of the institution’s funds under various policies, including the Allowable Expenditure, Travel and Entertainment Policy, the Procurement Policy, the Contracting Policy, and others. Budget administrators are expected to be familiar with the requirements of those policies and related procedures.  The office of [Business Services](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/administration/vpfin/finance-office/bsnsvcs) provides a variety of resources  to support appropriate contracting and procurement practices, as well as information about insurance requirements and recommendations. Middlebury’s mission of teaching and learning is made stronger by the careful stewardship of its resources to our educational programs and services.
