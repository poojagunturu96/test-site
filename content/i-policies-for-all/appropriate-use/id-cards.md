The MiddCard is a personal identification card with a photograph, issued to students, faculty, and staff for use on-campus.  Members of the Middlebury community are asked to carry their cards while on campus.  MiddCards are not transferable and must be presented on request to authorized Middlebury representatives, including Public Safety/Campus Security and other officials. Information on obtaining a MiddCard at the Vermont campus is available on [Public Safety’s website](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/public-safety). Information on obtaining a MiddCard on the Monterey campus is available on [Campus Security's website](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/offices-services/security).

The photos as well as other information related to an individual MiddCard will usually be considered personally identifiable information and protected as such. Information about IT systems and controls is available within the [ITS policies](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/information-technology-services/policies).
