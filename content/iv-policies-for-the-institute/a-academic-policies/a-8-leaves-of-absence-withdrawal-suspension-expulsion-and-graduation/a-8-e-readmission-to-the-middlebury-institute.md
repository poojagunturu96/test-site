A student who has withdrawn from the Middlebury Institute must apply to the Admissions Office for readmission if s/he wishes to return to the Institute after officially withdrawing, or if the student has been absent from the Institute for a fall or spring semester without registering for a leave of absence. Readmitted students shall be bound by the degree requirements in effect at the time of readmission and the application fee currently in effect will be charged. **International students** who remain in the U. S. during their absence from the Middlebury Institute must provide proof with their readmission that they have maintained their immigration status.
