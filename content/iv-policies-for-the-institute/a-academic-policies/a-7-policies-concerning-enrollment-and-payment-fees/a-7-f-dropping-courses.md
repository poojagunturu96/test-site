title: "A.7.f. Dropping Courses"
---

A student who wishes to drop course must do so through BannerWeb before the published deadline. Note: Without an official drop, tuition charges for the course remain due and payable. International students may carry fewer than 12 credits in their last semester ONLY if that is all they need to finish their degree. Otherwise they may not drop below 12 credits without authorization from the international student advisor at the Middlebury Institute.

If a student merely stops attending a class and does not officially drop it, s/he will remain on the class roll and the instructor will assign a grade.

No record is kept of a course(s) that is dropped by 4 P.M. on the 20<sup>th</sup> business day of the regular academic term. No course(s) may be dropped after the 20<sup>th</sup> business day of a regular term (10<sup>th</sup> day of half-semester courses and degree program courses in the summer session), except when illness or other emergency requires a leave of absence or withdrawal from the Institute. Weekend workshops and other brief courses may be dropped until 4 P.M. on the last business day a week before they begin, unless otherwise specified in the course schedule, and except when illness or other emergency occurs.  Withdrawing from a course after the published deadline requires a petition for waiver of academic regulations.  If granted, a “W” grade, that does not affect the GPA, will be recorded and tuition will remain due and payable.
