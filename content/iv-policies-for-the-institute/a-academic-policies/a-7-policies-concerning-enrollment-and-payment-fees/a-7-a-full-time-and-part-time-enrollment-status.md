**A. Regular Academic Terms (Fall and Spring Semesters)**<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>

During the fall and spring semesters, a student is considered full-time when enrolled for twelve or more credits, half time when enrolled for six to eleven (6-11) credits, and less than half time when enrolled for fewer than six (6) credits. A student who is half time or less than half time is considered part-time.

**International students** are required to enroll full-time for a minimum of 12 credits each semester. International students may carry fewer than 12 credits in their last semester ONLY if that is all they need to finish their degree. Otherwise they may not drop below 12 credits without authorization from the Student Services Office at the Middlebury Institute.

**B. Summer and Winter Sessions**

During the regular summer session (excluding the Summer Intensive Language Programs), a full-time load is defined as six (6) credits. For the Summer Intensive Language Programs, different policies apply; please see the appropriate program brochures available from Program offices.
