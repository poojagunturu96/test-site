title: "A.4.a. Admission of BAIS Students to a Master's Program"
---

The last cohort of the BA in International Studies was admitted in January 2016\. Until all current BAIS students complete their BA degrees, the following policies apply:

- Admission to the BA in International Studies (BAIS) program at the Institute does not guarantee admission to one of the Institute’s graduate degree programs, but BAIS students may apply to continue their studies in a master’s program.
- Once a student has reached the threshold of 100 credits, the student should meet with an advisor regarding his/her plans for continuing study in an MA program.
- The student shall be required to submit an application and statement of purpose for a master’s degree to the Admissions Office. No application fee is required, but the student is evaluated to determine if the student satisfies the specific admissions requirements for the degree program.
- BA students who have not yet been admitted to a Master’s program may enroll in all graduate level classes offered by the International Policy and Development program with the exception of research seminars. Enrollment in graduate level classes offered by other programs at the Middlebury Institute may require additional approval.
