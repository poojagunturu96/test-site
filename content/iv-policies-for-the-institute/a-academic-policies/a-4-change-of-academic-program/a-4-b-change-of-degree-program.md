The process for changing degree programs includes the following steps:

- The student discusses the matter with his/her advisor, including eligibility and possible implications for degree requirements and degree completion.
- The advisor directs the student to the appropriate procedure, depending on the studentâ€™s current and future programs. Some changes of degree program require a new application through the admission office.
- Once a change of program has been completed and approved by all relevant parties, the advisor works with the student to develop a new plan of study for the new degree.
