Students enrolled in a graduate program at the Middlebury Institute who wish to add a second degree must apply for the second degree through the Admissions Office. No application fee is required. A second degree requires a minimum of an additional thirty (30) credits in residence beyond the requirements for the first degree, as well as satisfaction of all of the core requirements of the second degree.
