Students enrolled at the Middlebury Institute may elect to apply to pursue studies external to the Middlebury Institute, including study abroad, for academic credit as part of a Middlebury Institute degree program. The typical period for external study or study abroad is one semester. Written approval must be obtained in advance from the relevant Graduate School dean using the Petition to Transfer Course Credits, which is available in the Records Office. Financial aid arrangements must be made in advance with the Office of Student Financial Services, and such arrangements shall apply only to approved programs. Please also see sections below on Transfer of Academic Credit from Other Academic Institutions.
