title: "A.5.c. Student Grading of Other Students' Work"
---

Graduate assistants or work-study students acting as teaching assistants shall not participate in the evaluation or grading of the work of other students. In exceptional cases, faculty such as those teaching a practicum or methods course in language teaching may have their students correct the written work of students taking a lower language course. Such faculty-supervised correction is appropriate so long as it does not entail a student giving another student an evaluation or grade. In such cases, the supervising faculty shall ensure the anonymity of the student whose work is being corrected.
