<span>A credit hour is an amount of work, represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement, that is an institutionally established equivalency reasonably approximating not less than—</span>

(1) One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks in one semester, or the equivalent amount of work over a different period of time; or

<span>(2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, and other academic work leading to the awarding of credit hours.  We do not award credit hours solely for doing an internship. Internships for which credit is awarded must be an integral part of a more extended academic activity for which credit hours have been assigned based on the definition above.</span>

There is no other system of gradingor grading categoryat the Middlebury Institute other than thoselisted above.

Except for grades of “I’ and “IP,” all grades are considered final when reported by a faculty member at the end of a semester or marking period. A change of grade may be requested **only** when a calculation, clerical, administrative, or recording error is discovered in the original assignment of a course grade or when a decision is made by a faculty member to change the grade as a result of the disputed academic evaluation procedure. Grade changes necessitated by a calculation, clerical, administrative, or recording error must be reported within a period of six months from the time the grade is awarded. **No grade may be changed as the result of a re-evaluation of a student’s work or the submission of supplemental work** following the close of a semester or marking period. The Records Office shall only accept permissible changes of grade upon written approval of the faculty member’s dean, who shall first verify that the Change of Grade request satisfies legitimate criteria.
