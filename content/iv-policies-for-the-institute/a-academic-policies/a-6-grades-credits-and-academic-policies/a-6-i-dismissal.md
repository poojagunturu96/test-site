title: "A.6.i. Dismissal"
---

A student who fails to make satisfactory academic progress for two consecutive semesters or who otherwise fails to achieve relief from academic probation status by the end of the following semester is subject to immediate dismissal for academic reasons.

Following notice of such dismissal, an application for readmission will be considered only after one full calendar year has elapsed. Students may be granted or denied readmission only at the discretion of the Institute. Following readmission after academic dismissal, the student is on academic probation for the first subsequent semester.

For an international student, dismissal from the Institute has an immediate effect on the right of presence in the U.S. International students should consult with the international student advisor in Student Services about their options.
