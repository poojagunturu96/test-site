title: 'A.6.f. Assignment of "In Progress"'
---

A grade of In Progress (IP) is assigned only in those courses for which the principal requirement of the course is unfinished by the end of an academic term, e.g., a capstone, thesis, business plan, or program portfolio. In these cases, an “I” (Incomplete) is not appropriate. Those programs that utilize the IP grade option may have different requirements for the amount of time provided to complete the work and remove the IP. Please consult the dean of the appropriate Graduate School.
