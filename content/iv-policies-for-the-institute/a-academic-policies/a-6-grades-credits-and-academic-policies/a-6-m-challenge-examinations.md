Challenge examinations (credits by examination) are not accepted at the Middlebury Institute. Students may only receive academic credit for courses not taken at the Middlebury Institute by following the policies and procedures for Transfer of Academic Credit from Other Institutions, above. Mechanisms for taking account of previous course work include waivers of requirements, transfer of credits, and advanced entry, available in certain programs (please consult with the appropriate program chair and/or dean).
