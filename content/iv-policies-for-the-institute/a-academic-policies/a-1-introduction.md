Academic policies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies are subject to change at the discretion of the Institute. The vice president of academic affairs and dean of the Institute (VPAA) provides the final interpretation of the provisions of each policy.

The Academic Policies, Standards, and Instruction Committee (APSIC) is a faculty committee that periodically reviews and recommends changes to the academic standards and policies of the Institute. These recommendations are forwarded to the Faculty Senate and VPAA for review and recommendation. Final decision is by the VPAA.
