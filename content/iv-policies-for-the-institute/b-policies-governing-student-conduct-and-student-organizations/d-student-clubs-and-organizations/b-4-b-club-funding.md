Student clubs may qualify for Student Council funding. See below for funding guidelines.

## Guidelines for Club Funding

Student clubs are eligible to receive funding from the Student Council on an ad hoc basis. Student clubs must complete the [Funding Request](https://forms.miis.edu/student-life/clubs/club-funding/request) form in order to request club funding from the Student Council. Only approved clubs will be considered for Student Council funding.

### <span style="color:#660000">Budget Procedures Information</span>

- Funding may be granted by the Student Council for all, some, or none of the requested amount.
- Student clubs should be prepared to meet some of their costs either by [fundraising](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/student-life/clubs/funding/fundraising) or by charging the participants fees, if necessary.
- Student clubs are accountable for how they spend funds received from the Student Council.
  - Funds allocated by the Student Council may not be sent to other organizations as donations, nor may they be used for activities not approved by the Student Council.
- Funds may be spent only for the activities and materials approved by the Student Council. Spending for non-approved purposes may result in reimbursement refusal.
- Clubs must follow the procedures for reimbursement and revenue. Contact the [Office of Student Services](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/student-life/team) for assistance.
- The Student Council will not fund meals at expensive restaurants, costly equipment, luxury goods, elaborate parties, or activities that benefit only a small number of students.
- If a club wishes to challenge a decision of the Student Council, the club treasurer must attend a Student Council General Session meeting and present the budget request. Should a motion be made to reconsider the decision of the Student Council, it must pass by a two-thirds majority vote of the Student Council.
  - Inclusion on the meeting agenda should be arranged in advance by submitting an [Agenda Request Form](https://forms.miis.edu/student-life/council/agenda).
- Funds allocated to a club from the SC will be processed through the Student Council account. Funds will never be transferred to an outside bank account.
- Additionally, approved student clubs are not permitted to maintain independent bank accounts. All monies, whether allocated from the Student Council or those raised by the club, must be processed through the Student Council bank account. Generally funds will not be transferred to a separate budget account.
- If a club plans to host a forum or conference, make sure to read through the [Forum Funding](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/student-life/clubs/funding/forums) policies and procedures.

## Fundraising

Student groups may be allowed to fundraise to defray costs of a limited number of special Institute-approved projects. The [Office of Student Services](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/student-life/team) gives approval to student organizations to raise money on campus, and the [Office of Advancement](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/giving/team) approves all off-campus fundraising initiatives.

### <span style="color:#660000">Eligibility</span>

Only groups that are recognized by the Student Council and the Office of Student Services may engage in any fundraising activities. Fundraising on the Institute’s behalf (or use of the Institute’s Federal Tax ID number) without express authorization of Student Services and the Advancement Office is a violation of this policy.

## Forum Funding

Student clubs wishing to host a forum or conference may qualify for forum funding.

### <span style="color:#660000">Forum Funding Guidelines</span>

The Student Council encourages the academic, professional, and cultural interests of the Institute's student clubs by supporting those students who wish to host a large-scale event such as a conference or panel. Please read below for more information.

### <span style="color:#660000">General Overview</span>

- Support the academic and cultural interests of students by providing thought-provoking and insightful perspectives on international topics.
- Bring together leading experts and professionals to share knowledge and experiences and provide opportunities to network.
- Speakers must be professional/accredited persons to speak or perform at a forum sponsored by Student Council or a club.
- The event should provide interpretation services when available.
- The [Translation and Interpretation](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/degree-programs/translation-interpretation/faculty) programs should be consulted.
- Joint club sponsorship by at least two clubs increases the strength of an application.
- There is no specification made as to whether or not there should be a balanced perspective provided on an issue, but it must be clear on whether this is the case.

### <span style="color:#660000">Forum Funding Policies and Process</span>

- **All forum funding proposals must be presented to the Student Council in person at a Student Council General Session meeting at least two weeks prior to the event**. The requesting Club or student must submit an [**Agenda Request Form**](https://forms.miis.edu/student-life/council/agenda) and receive confirmation of attendance at the Student Council meeting.
- Clubs must seek funding from respective programs and departments before applying for forum funds through the Student Council.
- The Student Council will vote on an approved amount to award for each forum. Clubs are strongly encouraged to not provide any financial compensation to speakers.
- If a club is applying for a second forum within the same academic year, priority consideration will be given to those who have not received forum funds. This is not a guarantee for secured funds, but this will be considered.
- Your club may not receive the full funding amount requested.
