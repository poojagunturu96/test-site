Food and beverages are permitted to be served at all club events. However, approval is required, and some on-campus locations may have restrictions regarding the consumption of food and beverages on the premises. Questions regarding campus policies can be directed to Room Reservations.

The club hosting the event is responsible for providing its own utensils, tablecloths, and napkins.
