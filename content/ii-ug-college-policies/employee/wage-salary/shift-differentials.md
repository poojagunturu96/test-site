title: "6.4 Shift Differentials"
---

Middlebury College provides an hourly wage supplement called a shift differential to non-exempt employees who work between the hours of 6 p.m. and 7 a.m. The purpose of shift differentials is to recognize that these hours, while essential to operate the facilities of the College, are generally more challenging for staff members to work.

Shift Identification:

Day Shift Period: Hours between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m.;

Evening Shift Period: Hours between 6 p.m. and 12 a.m.;

Night Shift Period: Hours between 12 a.m. and 7 a.m.

All non-exempt employees are paid an additional $.60 per hour for each hour worked in the evening shift period and an additional $1.50 per hour for each hour worked in the night shift period. Shifts are identified in BannerWeb as Shift 1 (day), Shift 2 (evening), and Shift 3 (nights). For example, an employee who works 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. would enter 3 hours in Shift 2 (9 p.m.–12 a.m.) and 5 hours in Shift 3 (12 a.m.–5 a.m.). Shift differentials are paid only for hours worked and are included in the calculation of overtime pay rates. Differentials are not paid for CTO, SLR, bereavement, holiday, and other time off.

Departmental exceptions to this policy must be approved by Human Resources. Ineligible positions include tipped employee jobs and student jobs (contact Human Resources for complete list).  Shift differential amounts will be periodically reviewed.
