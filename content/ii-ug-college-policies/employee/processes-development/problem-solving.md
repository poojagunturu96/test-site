Middlebury College strives to maintain effective employer-employee and employee-employee relations within the context of the at-will employment relationship. The College seeks to promote open communication between its employees with appropriate involvement of Human Resources, if necessary, to facilitate a resolution of employee concerns. Employees are encouraged to bring concerns directly to the attention of their immediate supervisor or, if uncomfortable in doing so, to their second level manager, Human Resources, Middlebury College Staff Council (MCSC), or an ombudsperson. If the concern remains unresolved, formal College resources such as an ombudsperson, the Human Resources Office, or the MCSC should be engaged. After a minimum of two rounds of problem solving, having involved an ombudsperson or a member of Human Resources, the employee may file a grievance. A list of ombudspersons can be found under [**People Who Can Help**](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/business/hr/staffandfaculty/problem) on the Human Resources Web site.
