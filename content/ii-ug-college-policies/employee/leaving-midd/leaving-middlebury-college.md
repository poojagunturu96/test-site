Middlebury College values employees' contributions to the successful operation of the College, expecting a productive and mutually satisfactory employment relationship. It is understood, however, that the employment relationship between Middlebury College and its employees is at-will, meaning that either the College or the employee may terminate that relationship with or without notice or cause, at any time.

Human Resources will provide departing employees with a packet of information summarizing changes to employee benefits, conversion privileges, repayment of outstanding debts to the College, and return of College-owned property.
