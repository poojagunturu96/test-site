A Reduction in Force (RIF) is defined as the laying off of one or more staff employees. The purpose of the procedure is to ensure appropriate consultation and communication within the College community as well as to clarify procedures to be followed. The procedures go into effect at the time a possible RIF is announced. This procedure does not apply to seasonal employees, employees hired for fixed periods of time, or employees dismissed as an outcome of performance concerns.
