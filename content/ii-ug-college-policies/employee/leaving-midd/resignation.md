title: "9.2 Voluntary Termination of Employment: Resignation"
---

Resignation is defined as employment termination initiated by an employee who chooses to leave the College voluntarily. Employees who are considering leaving Middlebury College for any reason are encouraged to discuss their situation with their immediate supervisors before making a final decision.

If the employee voluntarily leaves the College, it is expected that as much notice as possible will be given. At least two working weeks' notice is customary for non-exempt (hourly paid) employees, while administrative and professional staff (salaried) are expected to give at least one month's notice. A letter of resignation addressed to the department head, stating the final date(s) of employment will be forwarded to Human Resources. Before leaving, the employee should contact the Human Resources office to confirm benefit transition arrangements and to turn in ID cards, keys, and any other College property.
