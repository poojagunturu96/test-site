New Employee Orientation is offered to full-time and part-time benefits eligible employees as well as certain time-limited positions regularly throughout the year.  Orientation dates are included in new employee appointment letters.

Orientation is hosted by Human Resources and is designed to introduce new staff members to the history, culture, and mission of Middlebury College.  The orientation program provides employees with the opportunity to meet different members of the community, learn about the campus, review College policies, and enroll in benefit programs for which they are eligible.
