title: "2.5 Employment of Family Members"
---

The College has no prohibition against hiring relatives of existing employees but understands that employment of relatives in the same area of the College may impact departmental functioning. To minimize any potential issues with regard to relatives working together, it is strongly recommended that an immediate family member does not have supervisory responsibilities for another family member. Immediate family for the purpose of this policy is defined as spouse, domestic partner, civil union partner, parent, grandparent, sibling, or child.
