When employees first report to work, their supervisors will show them the workplace, explain the responsibilities and procedures of the position, and answer any questions they might have.

Additionally, new employees will receive information from their supervisors about paychecks, College IDs, College policies regarding overtime, CTO, sick leave reserve, attendance, performance evaluations, and wage reviews; keeping records current; automobile registration and parking; arrangements for necessary keys; lunch schedules and facilities; any required training associated with the position; and campus orientation.

Supervisors should access the [Supervisor Check List](https://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/292393/original/hiring_supervisor_checklist.pdf) for new employee orientation suggestions.
