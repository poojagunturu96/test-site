---

Middlebury College values the health and safety of its employees. The College also adheres to United States Coast Guard and U.S. Department of Transportation requirements for those employees who hold positions as Captain or Crew Member of the College’s research vessel. Such employees are subject to the controlled substance and alcohol testing rules.

Middlebury College is committed to the strict enforcement of United States Coast Guard and U.S. Department of Transportation regulations applicable to vessels licensed to carry passengers or engaged in commercial service. These regulations prohibit the use, sale, distribution, manufacture, or possession of illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia. This policy is designed to protect public safety by testing for substances at or above threshold levels of metabolites including, but not limited to, those listed below:

Amphetamines (Speed)…………..250 ng/mL

.MDMA (Ecstasy)………………….250 ng/mL

Benzoylecogine (Cocaine)……….100 ng/mL

Cannbinoids (Marijuana)…………..15 ng/mL

Opiates (Heroin, Codeine)…….2,000 ng/mL

Phencyclidine (PCP)……………….25 ng/mL

To facilitate enforcement  of the provisions of this policy, Middlebury College will use every legal means to deter and/or detect violations including, but not limited to, urine, breath, or blood testing of Captains, crewmembers and independent contractors as required by DOT and USCG under the following circumstances:

1)    Pre-employment. A condition of hiring a new employee is the passing of a pre-employment drug test.

2)    Reasonable Suspicion. In situations where the employer is aware of facts that would lead him/her to suspect the drug policy has been violated, a drug test will be conducted.

3)    Post Incident. In case of a “serious marine incident” as defined in 46 CFR Part 4, the employer must determine who should be tested.

4)    Random. Any time during an employee’s work schedule, he/she is subject to an unannounced random test for the illegal use of drugs.

5)    Periodic. As required upon license renewal, usually exempt as in 46 CFR Part 16.220.

6)    Return to Duty. An employee who tests positive may be terminated by the employer, or alternatively, if directed to counseling or rehabilitation, as a condition of continued employment, must submit to unannounced drug tests for a specific period.

Tests will be performed by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) certified laboratory personnel experienced in collection protocols, chain of custody procedures, drug test and confirmation methods, and Medical Review Officer functions.

Middlebury College will take appropriate disciplinary action, including the possibility of termination of employment and/or services as well as possible suspension of United States Coast Guard license and/or Merchant Mariner Document, and legal prosecution, for violations of this policy. We understand that _The Maritime Consortium, Inc._, is also required to notify the U.S. Coast Guard in the case of any positive tests. We further recognize that chemical dependencies are a personal concern for many individuals and accordingly encourage drug abusers to immediately seek professional help such as is available through the confidential services of our Employee and Family Assistance Program (EFAP).

Middlebury College supports the necessity for maintaining a Drug-Free Policy and pledges to abide by the provisions of this policy and DOT/Coast Guard drug and alcohol testing rules.
