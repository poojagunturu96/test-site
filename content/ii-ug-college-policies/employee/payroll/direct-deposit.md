Employees are strongly encouraged to have pay checks directly deposited. Deposits may be made toÂ any U.S. domestic bank by filling out the online form via [BannerWeb](https://ssb-prod.ec.middlebury.edu/PNTR/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin?) ([click here for instructions](https://www.middlebury.edu/system/files/media/HOW%20TO%20INSTRUCTIONS%20FOR%20ONLINE%20DIRECT%20DEPOSITS%20-%202.pdf)). An employee may elect to deposit to a maximum of two bank accounts if so desired; however, partial direct deposit is not permitted. Pay stubs are mailed to the employee's campus address.

When a request is made for direct deposit to a new bank or account, the first check issued after the request will be a real check while the information is pre-noted to the bank. Provided the information is correct, the next paycheck will be a direct deposit.
