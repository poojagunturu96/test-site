title: "4.7 Jury Duty"
---

The College encourages employees to accept their civic responsibility if they are called for jury duty. All full- and part-time employees, excluding temporary employees, will be paid for time off for required jury duty. The employee's status at the College will remain the same and all benefits will continue.

When called for jury duty, the employee must notify the supervisor and provide subsequent notification of jury duty related absences. The College will continue to pay the eligible employee for scheduled hours missed due to jury duty. Whenever employees are released from jury duty for partial or full days, they are expected to report for work at the College. An employee's time record must accurately reflect jury duty service.
