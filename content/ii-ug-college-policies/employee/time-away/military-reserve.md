A military leave of absence is granted to employees to attend scheduled drills or training or if called to active duty with the United States armed services.  Eligible employees may receive up to 10 days per calendar year of paid Military Leave.

Middlebury College offers a pay differential to those eligible employees who have been called to active duty in addition to their reserve obligation (one weekend per month and two weeks per year).

To be eligible to receive either military reserve benefit, the employee must be a full-time employee who has satisfactorily completed the three-month provisional period with the College; provide the College with advance notice of impending service unless precluded by military necessity; and submit a copy of his or her military leave and earnings statement for the covered period.
