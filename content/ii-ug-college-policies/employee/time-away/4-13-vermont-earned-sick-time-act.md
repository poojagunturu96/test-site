title: "4.13 Vermont Earned Sick Time Act"
---

The Vermont Earned Sick Time Act (21 V.S.A. §§ 481–486) provides that employers must allow eligible employees to accrue a bank of hours that may be used as paid time off for certain health or safety needs and/or for the care of a qualifying family member.  Three of Middlebury’s employee paid time off policies - Combined Time Off (CTO), Faculty Leave Reserve (FLR) and Vermont Earned Sick Time (VEST) - meet or exceed the provisions of this law. Eligibility for paid time off benefits is based on employment classification and work state: 

*   benefits-eligible staff employees fall under the CTO policy,
*   benefits-eligible faculty members have FLR, and
*   certain student employees as well as non-benefits eligible faculty and staff employees _who work in Vermont_ may be eligible for VEST. 

Employees should refer to the Combined Time Off, Faculty Sick Leave Reserve or Vermont Earned Sick Time policies for specific eligibility and benefit provisions.
