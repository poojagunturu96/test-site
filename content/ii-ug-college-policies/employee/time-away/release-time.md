Release time may be approved by the president or her designee, in order to allow staff to attend certain campus-wide events. If release time falls during an employee's regularly scheduled hours it is considered regular paid time. If release time falls during a time when an employee is not scheduled to work, he or she may choose to attend the event, but the time is unpaid.
