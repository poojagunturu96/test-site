If an employee is unable to report to work for any reason, it is his or her responsibility to notify the supervisor as soon as possible prior to the start of the workday. If the employee is unable to reach the supervisor, s/he should follow the department's procedure for notification. Failure to notify the College of an absence before the start of the workday means the absence is unauthorized and can lead to disciplinary action.
