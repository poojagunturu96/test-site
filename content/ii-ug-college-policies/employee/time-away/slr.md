title: "4.3 Sick Leave Reserve"
---

Sick Leave Reserve can be used in the event employees have a bona fide illness, injury, physically disabling condition including pregnancy, or if they must care for an ill member of their immediate family. SLR may not be used to care for well infants, children, or other family members. Those included in the definition of immediate family are individuals permanently residing in the employee's home or temporarily residing with the employee as a result of the family member's illness, including, but not limited to spouse/domestic partner/civil union partner, children, parents, and parents-in-law.

Appointments with physicians, dentists, or other health care providers that take place during normal working hours may be claimed.

Time from an employee's CTO bank may be transferred into the employeeâ€™s Sick Leave Reserve (SLR) bank. Sick Leave Reserve time, however, cannot be transferred to CTO. Employees must call in, using their department's protocol, if they are going to be absent from work. Doctor's notes may be required.

**Exempt Staff SLR Use**

As per the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), exempt staff are paid on a salaried basis. This dictates that their pay does not vary with regard to the number of hours worked. Exempt staff often work in excess of their normal scheduled hours and do not receive overtime or any additional pay beyond their salary. Therefore, occasional brief absences from work of less than a day will not be deducted from the SLR banks of exempt staff with the exception of approved leaves of absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). SLR will be recorded in full day increments when an exempt staff member is away from work for the entire day. In situations of a reduced schedule or repeated or regular absences, managers and staff should make arrangements to enter SLR to adjust for absences; the use of half days may be a useful alternative in these cases.

**SLR Pay-Out**

Sick Leave Reserve has no cash value.
