Employees needing to take time off because of the death of an immediate family member must notify their supervisor as soon as possible.Bereavement leave is intended to be used in the event of a dealth; it cannot be used for serious illness or other purposes.

Paid or unpaid time off will be granted to allow employees to grieve, make any necessary arrangements and attend the funeral. Full- and part-time benefits-eligible employees may receive up to three days of paid bereavement leave for each death.

Bereavement pay is based on the pay employees would have earned had they worked the day(s) of their leave.

Employees will receive approval of bereavement leave as long as there are no unusual operating requirements. Any employee may, with the supervisor's approval, use available paid leave or unpaid leave for additional time off.

Immediate family includes the employee's spouse/partner, parent, child, sibling, grandparents, grandchildren, the employee's child's spouse, parent-in-law, brother and sister-in-law, grandparents-in-law, and other relatives residing in the employee's household.
