title: "4.5 Staff Parental Leave Policy"
---

Benefits-eligible employees with one year of service in a benefits eligible position are eligible for up to six weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child. Adopted children must be under 18 years of age. In order to receive paid leave, employees must meet eligibility requirements prior to the date of birth or adoption.

Parental leave may be used pre- or post-birth or adoption and will be applied to the 12 weeks of leave allowed under the [Family and Medical Leave policy](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/time-away/family-medical-leave). Paid leave must be taken within one year of the birth or adoption.

In compliance with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines, "disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, childbirth and recovery therefrom are, for all job-related purposes temporary disabilities and should be treated as such under any health or temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan available in connection with employment." This principle ensures that pregnant employees will be in no worse and no better position with regard to job related practices and benefits than employees similarly situated suffering from other disabilities. The determination of the length of time an employee will require for leave because of pregnancy and childbirth is a medical decision between the woman and her physician, to be treated in the same way as other sick leave, in compliance with the provisions of Vermont law.
