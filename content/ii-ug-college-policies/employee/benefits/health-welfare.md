The Middlebury College Health and Welfare Benefit Plan offers medical, dental, vision, life, supplemental life, long-term disability and short-term disability insurance plans, and health care and dependent care flexible spending accounts to full time staff and faculty members; to part-time or time-limited staff who are engaged to work a minimum of 1,000 hours and for a minimum of 9 months in a regular part-time job; as well as to part-time faculty members scheduled to teach at least half time when they teach courses in both semesters. On-call, temporary, and seasonal staff and faculty working less than half-time and/or for single semesters are not eligible for benefits, except that certain employees may be eligible for medical benefits under the terms of the federal Affordable Care Act.
