Middlebury College offers a comprehensive health and welfare benefit plan and a generous retirement program to eligible employees.

Enrollment in some College benefit plans is not automatic. Although Human Resources makes an effort to notify or remind employees when they become eligible to enroll in a particular benefit plan, it is the employee's responsibility to enroll in a timely manner. Please consult with Human Resources should any questions arise concerning eligibility for, or status in, a benefit plan.

Although it is the intent of the College to continue the benefit plans described in this section, the College reserves the right to modify, amend, or terminate any benefit plan, with or without notice.
