---

At retirement, as defined in the College's [Retiree BenefitsÂ policy](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/leaving-midd/retirement), accumulated sick leave reserve or faculty leave reserve will convert to a period of Middlebury-paid retiree insurance (see Health & Welfare Summary Plan or contact Human Resources for details).

**Sick/Faculty Leave Reserve Survivors' Conversion**  
If a Middlebury College employee dies while in an active status, survivors' benefits will be provided (for eligible dependents) in the medical and dental plans. See [Survivor Benefits](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/benefits/survivor-benefits) section of this Handbook for details.

_Note:_ There is no cash conversion of sick/faculty leave reserve.
