---

All employees of Middlebury College are eligible for an identification card, called a MiddCard, which entitles the employee to certain privileges including: access to athletic facilities, discounts at the College store, library privileges, and discounts at cultural and sporting events. In addition, the card allows door access to certain campus buildings.

Spouses or domestic partners of benefits-eligible employees are eligible to receive a Spouse/Partner card with the same privileges as the employee card (except door access).

Both employee and spouse/partner cards are valid only during the employeeâ€™s period of active employment. Employees who retire from the College may be eligible for a Retiree/Emeriti card.

Questions regarding card eligibility can be directed to Human Resources; questions regarding new or replacement cards or door access should be directed to Public Safety; and questions regarding discounts, events, or athletic facilities access or policies should be directed to the responsible department (i.e. Book Store, Athletics, etc.)
