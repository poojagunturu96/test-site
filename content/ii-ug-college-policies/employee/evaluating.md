title: "7. Evaluating Job Performance"
---

Middlebury College requires annual written performance evaluations for all staff employees. Mid-year performance evaluations are conducted at six month intervals between the annual written performance evaluations. These meetings allow employees and supervisors to establish performance expectations and goals for the future and to review previously communicated performance expectations and development plans. The process also establishes the link between performance and suggested merit increases.

The College encourages supervisors to provide opportunities throughout the year for less formal verbal performance feedback to employees.
