**TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ADMINISTRATIVE APPOINTMENTS**

Vice presidents, deans, chairs, program directors, and heads of administrative departments are appointed by the president and continue in office at the pleasure of the president. In normal cases, such appointments are for a specified term, regularly from three to five years. Appointments take effect on July 1 and continue until June 30 of the year of termination.

Appointments may be renewed by the president or terminated by either the president or the appointee, but, in any event, all such appointments will be reviewed by the president upon expiration of the stated term.

At the time a department chair is to be appointed, the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty will consult with all members of the department to solicit their suggestions and judgments about possible candidates.
