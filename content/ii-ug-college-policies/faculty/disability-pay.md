**Introduction**

Faculty who find that they need a leave of more than three days for medical reasons should arrange to meet with or otherwise contact the VPAA/DoF as soon as possible.

Middlebury College provides two income replacement programs for faculty members unable to work due to disability. The VPAA/DoF will work with the faculty member and Human Resources to make any necessary FMLA leave and disability pay arrangements and to ensure a smooth transition for the faculty member to and from disability status.

Details about the benefits available to faculty needing short- or long-term medical leaves or FMLA leave can be obtained by contacting Human Resources (x 5465) or from the Human Resources web site: [https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/business/hr/staffandfaculty/benefits](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/business/hr/staffandfaculty/benefits).

**Short-term Disability Pay**

Middlebury provides a self-insured, employer-paid short-term disability (STD) benefit which is accessible by faculty members prevented from working due to a qualifying illness or injury. After a two-week elimination period STD pays 60% of pre-disability wages\* for up to 26 weeks. Full details on the benefit can be found in the Middlebury Health and Welfare Summary Plan Description (available on-line or from the Human Resources Office).

**Long-term Disability Pay**

Middlebury provides a fully-insured, employer-paid long-term disability (LTD) benefit which is available to faculty members unable to work for an extended period of time. LTD provides income replacement of 60% of pre-disability wages\* during a qualifying and approved disability (see the Middlebury College Health and Welfare Benefit Plan Summary Plan Description or contact Human Resources for details about this plan).

\*_In order to receive disability pay a faculty member **must** file a disability application (available from the Human Resources Department) in a timely manner; failure to do so will result in a delay or even loss of eligibility for income replacement benefits._

**Supplementing Disability Pay using Faculty Leave Reserve**

Faculty may arrange to use accrued Faculty Leave Reserve to augment the 60% short-term or long-term disability income replacement benefit as well as during the elimination period for STD, thus remaining at full salary. Arrangements to do so can be made through the Disability/Leave Specialist in the Human Resources Department.

**Timetable of Disability Pay, Benefits, and Status**

Many factors, such as a faculty member’s length of service, current benefit elections, full or partial disability status, etc. can affect the timeline of pay, benefits, and faculty status during a period of disability. The VPAA/DoF and Human Resources work together to communicate specific timeline information to faculty members unable to work due to a medical condition. The chart below illustrates the most straight-forward scenario: it assumes a faculty member with multiple years of service, tenure/tenure track status, current enrollment in employee benefits and full (not partial) disability.
