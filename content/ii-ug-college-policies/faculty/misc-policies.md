**1\. FYSE ENTERTAINMENT ALLOWANCE**  
Each FYSE has a course enrichment budget of $250.  In addition, the program provides $100 for social interactions with seminar students. Requests for reimbursements should be submitted through Oracle using the appropriate EDORDA for the expense.

**2\. PROGRAM ENRICHMENT FUNDS**  
Funds are budgeted each year earmarked for lectures, co-curricular programs specific to your department, and student research expenses. The dean of curriculum administers the budget. All expenses (honoraria, travel, entertainment, etc.) must come from this assignment. Vouchers, signed by the department chair, may be submitted directly to the Accounts Payable Office.

**3\. STUDENT ASSISTANTS**  
Undergraduates assisting in such academic work as correcting and reading papers and assisting in laboratories must first be approved by the chair of the department, who may consult with the VPAA/DoF in these matters.

**4\. COMMENCEMENT AND CONVOCATION**  
On Convocation and Commencement days all members of the faculty are invited and encouraged to participate in the academic ceremonies. Those faculty members not owning caps and gowns for the academic procession may rent them through the College Store. The College will pay the rental fees for caps, gowns, and hoods for untenured faculty. Orders should be given at least six weeks in advance of Commencement weekend. Academic regalia may be purchased by the faculty through the College Store; a payroll deduction loan program is available to do so. The College will purchase academic regalia for newly tenured faculty if they do not yet own regalia.

**5\. ELECTRONIC DEVICES IN CLASSES**  
Except for students whose needs are recognized by the College ADA office, the use of electronic devices (laptops, iPhones, Blackberries and other smart phones, etc.) by students in classes is subject to the approval of the instructor.  At any point in the semester, the instructor may choose to prohibit or limit the use of such devices by students without needs recognized by the ADA. The instructor’s decision should be made clear to the entire class, in verbal or written form.

**6.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MERIT**  
At an annual salary consultation, department chairs will advise the VPAA/DoF in interpreting annual faculty salary forms.  Faculty members may be recommended for salary increases based on continuing excellence in teaching effectiveness, scholarly and/or creative activity and contributions to the work of the College.  Department chairs will call the VPAA/DoF’s attention to faculty members who have distinguished themselves in at least one of these areas by notable or exceptional achievements within the previous year.

**7\. FACULTY PARTICIPATION IN A PRESIDENTIAL SEARCH**  
In the event of a presidential search, the faculty will elect three tenured representatives who will be available for service on a search committee. These elections will follow the same rules as those for the Promotions Committee, but with the inclusion on the ballot of associate professors, and will take place within six weeks from the date of announcement of a presidential search. Colleagues who do not wish to be elected can withdraw their names from the initial ballot. [Voted as advisory to the administration in April 2012]
