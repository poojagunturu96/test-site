---

From time to time faculty members are asked to present lectures and readings, to participate in panels, to speak with alumni groups, or in other ways to offer their time and professional knowledge to the larger College community. While this kind of activity is always secondary to teaching and research, it is an aspect of community service which the College encourages and honors. Invitations to serve the College in these ways should be considered public recognition of special accomplishment as teachers.

Normally, faculty members are not paid extra for these services, except for Alumni College and off-campus alumni events.
