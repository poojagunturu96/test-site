**1\. Evaluation of Student Work**

In all courses, instructors are expected to require a sufficient amount of written and/or oral and/or practical work so that both the instructor and the student are able to evaluate the student's progress in the course.

**2\. Student Rights and Freedoms in the Classroom**

The professor in the classroom and in conference should encourage free discussion, inquiry, and expression. Student performance should be evaluated solely on academic merit, and not on the basis of opinions or conduct unrelated to academic standards.

**a.** **_Protection of Freedom of Expression:_** Students should be free to take reasoned exception to the data or views offered in any course of study and to reserve judgment about matters of opinion, but they are responsible for learning the content of any course of study in which they are enrolled.

**b.** **_Protection against Improper Academic Evaluation:_** Students should have protection through orderly procedures against prejudices or capricious academic evaluation. Students remain responsible, however, for maintaining standards of academic performance in each course in which they are enrolled.

**i.** _Staff Courses:_ Where common material is taught within a single course by different members of the faculty, the department offering the course must see that proper consultation is carried out by the staff prior to submission of grades in order to assure a reasonable equity among different sections.

**ii.** _Injustice in Grading:_ A student may appeal a grade to the instructor who gave it. If the instructor believes that the student's case is justified, the instructor may request a grade change from the Administration Committee. A student who fails to receive satisfaction from the instructor may discuss the matter with the department chair and, if the student is still not satisfied, may submit an appeal in writing to the vice president for Academic Affairs / dean of the faculty (VPAA/DOF).

**c.** **_Protection against Improper Disclosure:_** Information about student views, beliefs, and political associations that professors acquire in the course of their work as instructors, advisors, and counselors should be considered confidential. Protection against improper disclosure is a serious professional obligation. Judgments of ability and character may be provided under appropriate circumstances, normally with the knowledge and consent of the student. Faculty members should use common sense in determining when refusal to divulge information about a student is likely to prove damaging.

**3\. Announcement of Work Required for Evaluation**

Early in the semester, preferably on the syllabus, instructors should inform their classes of the nature, extent, and due dates of all major work to be required for evaluation during the semester. Instructors must inform students prior to the end of the fifth week of major work that must be completed before the end of classes and during the final examination period.  No additional major papers or projects may be announced after the end of the fifth week of the semester. No new assignments of work for evaluation may be made during the last week of classes.

**4\. Final Examinations**

**a.** Instructors normally determine the form of the final exam when submitting course information to the course scheduler. For courses that have scheduled final exams, a preliminary exam schedule is published shortly after the add period each semester. A final examination may take one of several different forms:

**i.** **_A regularly scheduled written examination._** The time and place are established by the course scheduler.

**ii.** **_A self-scheduled examination._** Self-scheduled examinations are taken at a designated examination center according to the following schedule: 9-12 a.m.; 2-5 p.m.; and 7-10 p.m., during the examination period. Students pick examinations up at the designated examination center within 15 minutes of each starting time and take the exam to a designated examination room. Students must return examination papers to the examination center by the conclusion of the examination hours or sooner, according to the time allotted for the examination. Exams are date-stamped at that time.

**iii.** **_A take-home examination._** Take-home examinations may be taken at the student's convenience during the final examination period and will be returned to the instructor according to procedures established before the last day of classes.

**iv.** **_An oral examination._** Before the last day of classes an instructor will inform the student of the time and place of such an examination.

**v.** **_An open-book examination._** This may be either a self-scheduled or a take-home examination _(see b and c above)._

**b.** Final examinations may be given only during the final examination period. _(See "Final Examination Period" section below)_

**c.** Except for take-home examinations, final examinations may not be less than one or more than three hours in length.

**d.** Instructors should follow Article II of the Undergraduate Honor System in the conduct of final examinations.

**e.** Instructors should return final examination papers to students or keep them in their possession for one full semester.

**5\. Rescheduling of Examinations, Excused Absences, and Incompletes**

**a.** The Commons deans are charged with the responsibility of extending deadlines for papers and projects and determining that pre-announced examinations be rescheduled if warranted by compelling personal circumstances, illnesses, or injuries. In such cases, the dean will inform the instructor in writing. In response to a student's request, an instructor may reschedule a student's examination with the exception of a final examination, but he or she is not obliged to do so unless the Commons dean so decides.

**b.** An unexcused absence from a pre-announced examination will result in a grade of F for that unit of work.

**c.** The Commons dean may alter a student's final examination schedule (1) if the student has three examinations scheduled in 24 hours; (2) if there is a scheduling conflict (two exams at the same time); or (3) if there are emergencies or compelling circumstances. Final examination schedules will not be altered to accommodate student travel plans. Faculty members may not alter a student's final examination schedule. Students who miss a scheduled final examination may be given a grade of incomplete only with the written permission of the Commons dean. _(See "Grades and Records" section of this chapter)_

**6\. Final Examination Period**

For fall and spring semesters, the final examination period normally begins two to three days following the end of classes. Exams are scheduled for five days, as listed on the College calendar. The spring semester examination period may be shortened to avoid having Commencement occur later than May 30.

No activities, athletic events (games or practices), course registration, additional or makeup classes will be scheduled for this period of time. All class activities must be concluded on the last day of classes. A thesis defense may be scheduled during the final examination period.
