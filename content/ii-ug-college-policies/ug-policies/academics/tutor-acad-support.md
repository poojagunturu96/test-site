<span>Among Middlebury College's strengths are the accessibility of faculty and their willingness to help students. All faculty members maintain regular office hours, which are posted on office doors or within department offices.</span>

Whenever students experience difficulty in a course, they are encouraged to first seek help from the respective faculty member. Additional support is also available to help students reach their academic goals.at the Center for Teaching, Learning, & Research located in Davis Family Library (extension 3131). CTLR offers the following resources.

**Office of Learning Resources**

Beginning the first week of the semester, on weekdays, the professional and student staff of Learning Resources are available to meet with students for individual appointments. They assist students in assessing their academic needs and developing skills to meet these needs. Academic time management skills, class discussion skills, and select study skills including effective note taking, test preparation, and skills for managing academic stress and reducing anxiety that interferes with academic performance are necessities for all students to master. Competency in these skills is directly related to academic success and students fulfilling their academic and personal potential at college. These services are available to all Middlebury students and are free of charge. For additional information, call CTLR or visit the [OLR](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/teaching-learning-research/faculty-resources/teaching-resources) Web site.

**Quantitative Support**

Quantitative skills and reasoning ability have become an important component of many courses and majors. The director of Quantitative Support is available to assist students in a number of ways, including reviewing prior mathematics knowledge, discussing homework, preparing quantitative reports, and practicing for tests. In addition, trained peer tutors who have experience in quantitative courses and methods can assist students with homework and other quantitative projects.  For additional information, see the [Quantitative Skills Support](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/teaching-learning-research/faculty-resources/teaching-resources) Web site.

**Writing Center**

The ability to write clearly and effectively is central to a liberal arts education. As part of a program to encourage students' growth as writers during their four years at Middlebury, the Middlebury College Writing Center offers free professional and peer tutoring to student writers, including those for whom English is a second language, at any stage of any writing project, from organizing the work schedule, to brainstorming ideas, to talking through a draft, to revising and polishing rough drafts. Peer writing tutors are also trained to give tips and practical suggestions to assist students with oral presentations. This tutoring is available at the [Center for Teaching, Learning, and Research](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/teaching-learning-research) on the main floor of the Davis Family Library, Suite 225 Sunday through Thursday evenings and some evenings in the Commons and in the Anderson Freeman Center.
