**Withdrawal Policy**

**The withdrawal deadline for all programs is July 2**. The refund deadline expires at 5:00 pm EDT USA.

To withdraw from the Middlebury Language Schools, a student must complete and sign the official withdrawal form from the student's School.

Students who complete check in with the Language Schools, but who decide to leave for any reason before the end of the fifth day of classes will, in addition to forfeiting the non-refundable deposit, be assessed a withdrawal fee of $2,000\. This withdrawal fee is assessed because a place has been reserved for the student and cannot, therefore, be filled by another student. The Language Schools will not provide a refund if a student withdraws after the end of the fifth day of classes. Students who cancel before the start date of any program forfeit the $400 non-refundable deposit only.

Students who have utilized Federal Student Aid eligibility (loans and/or grants) will be subject to the Return of Title IV regulations set forth by the US Department of Education.

**REAPPLICATION AFTER WITHDRAWAL:** An undergraduate or graduate student who wishes to reapply after having withdrawn or been asked to withdraw for medical or psychological reasons will be required to submit a medical readmission form. The form must be completed and signed by the treating physician or psychotherapist indicating that the student is prepared to undertake an intensive program of study and noting what specific accommodations, if any, the student will request.
