This includes the name(s), address(es), and telephone number(s) of the minor’s parents or guardians.</p>\n<p>Only those who have a legitimate need to know should have access to information about minors. Otherwise, information about minors should not be disclosed (e.g., authorized pick-up and drop off of parties, the name and address of overnight stay locations, and any other information that could be used to lure a child).</p>\n<p><strong>7.  Reports to Middlebury Officials</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In case of an emergency or if safety is of immediate concern, dial 911</strong>.</p>\n<p>Any person who has reasonable cause to believe that a child has been abused or neglected or that anyone has engaged in prohibited conduct involving a child as defined in Section 3 of this policy should contact the Department of Public Safety (802.443.5911; Vermont campus), other campus safety/security personnel applicable to the program at issue, and/or the appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue (see contact information in <a href=\"#A\">Appendix A</a><span>,</span> below).

California</strong></h4>\n<p>Under California law, Cal. Penal Code § 11164-11174.3, certain individuals are <strong>required</strong> to report any incident where they have knowledge, observe, or reasonably suspect that a minor has been abused or neglected. The report <strong>must</strong> be made <strong>immediately</strong> or as soon as practically possible by phone to a county welfare department, probation department (if it is designated by the county to receive mandated reports), or to a police or sheriff’s department (not including a school district police or security department). A written report must be submitted on a Department of Justice form within 36 hours (forms are available here: <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/childabuse/forms\">https://oag.ca.gov/childabuse/forms</a>). Individuals with mandatory reporting obligations are listed below.</p>\n<p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of professionals who are required to report:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clergy members and any custodian of records of a clergy member</li>\n<li>Child care providers</li>\n<li>Educators</li>\n<li>Law enforcement</li>\n<li>Medical professionals</li>\n<li>Mental health professionals</li>\n<li>Commercial film and photographic print processors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A complete list of mandated reporters is provided in California Penal Code section 11165.7.<a title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref1\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a></p>\n<p>In addition to the above mandated reporters, California law provides that “any other person” who has knowledge, observes, or reasonably suspects that a child has been abused or neglected <em>may</em> make a report to a county welfare department, probation department (if it is designated by the county to receive mandated reports), or to a police or sheriff’s department (not including a school district police or security department). California Penal Code sections 11166(g), 11165.9.</p>\n<p>There are certain exceptions to the mandatory reporting requirement based on privilege. A clergy member who acquires evidence during a penitential communication is not required to report. The attorney-client privilege is preserved, such that a lawyer or his/her agent is not required to report. Reports shall contain the name, business address, and telephone number of the mandated reporter and the capacity that makes the person a mandated reporter. One who reports but is not a mandatory reporter is not required to include his/her name.</p>\n<p>The identity of the person making the report shall be confidential and disclosed only among agencies receiving and investigating mandated reports, to the prosecutor in a criminal proceeding or appointed counsel, unless the person reporting waives confidentiality or disclosure is required by court order.</p>\n<p>Under California law, Middlebury and its affiliates are prohibited from sanctioning an employee on the basis that s/he made a report of suspected child abuse, nor is the employer able to impede or impair the reporter’s reporting duties or require that the reporter disclose his or her identity to the employer.</p>\n<h4><strong>II.  New Mexico</strong></h4>\n<p>Under New Mexico law, N.M.S.A.. § 32A-4-3, certain individuals are <strong>required</strong> to report any incident where the person knows or has a reasonable suspicion that a minor has been abused or neglected. The report <strong>must</strong> be made <strong>immediately</strong> to a local law enforcement agency, the Children, Youth, and Families Department, or a trial law enforcement or social services agency for any Indian child residing in an Indian county.</p>\n<p>It is established that following professionals are required to report:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Licensed physician, resident or intern, a registered nurse</li>\n<li>Law enforcement officer</li>\n<li>A school teacher or official</li>\n<li>A social worker acting in an official capacity</li>\n<li>A member of the clergy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the above mandated reporters, it is presently an open question whether “every person” with knowledge or a reasonable suspicion of abuse or neglect is a mandated reporter under New Mexico law. <a title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref2\" href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a></p>\n<p>A person may not refuse to make a report required by law on the grounds that making the report would be privileged as a matter of law, except for a member of the clergy. Reports shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of the reporter.</p>\n<p>A person reporting an instance of alleged child neglect or abuse is immune from civil or criminal liability, unless the person reporting acted in bad faith or with malicious purpose. New Mexico law does not, however, explicitly state that the reporter’s identity will remain confidential, nor does it explicitly protect the reporter from retaliation by his/her employer.</p>\n<h4><strong>III.  Washington, D.C.</strong></h4>\n<p>Under Washington D.C. law, D.C. Code § 4-1321.02, certain individuals are <strong>required</strong> to report any incident where they know or have reasonable cause to suspect that a minor has been abused or neglected. The report <strong>must</strong> be made <strong>immediately</strong> to either the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia or the Child and Family Services Agency. Individuals with mandatory reporting obligations are listed below.</p>\n<p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of professionals who are required to report:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Child and Family Services Agency employees, agents, and contractors</li>\n<li>Every physician, psychologist, medical examiner, dentist, chiropractor, registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, person involved in the care and treatment of patients</li>\n<li>Law enforcement officers</li>\n<li>School officials, teachers, athletic coaches</li>\n<li>Domestic violence counselors</li>\n<li>Mental health professionals</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whenever a person is required to report in his or her capacity as a member of the staff of a school, she or he shall immediately notify the person in charge of the institution, or his or her designated agent, who shall then be required to make the report. This requirement does not relieve the staff-member of his or her obligation to make a report to the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia or the Child and Family Services Agency.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above mandated reporters, Washington D.C. law provides that any other person <em>may</em> make a report to the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia or the Child and Family Services Agency.</p>\n<p>The Washington D.C. statute does not explicitly state whether a party may refuse to make a report otherwise required by law on the basis of privilege. The report shall contain include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The name, age, sex, and address of (A) the child who is the subject of the report; (B) each of the child's siblings and other children in the household; and (C) each of the child's parents or other persons responsible for the child's care;</li>\n<li>The nature and extent of the abuse or neglect of the child and any previous abuse or neglect, if known;</li>\n<li>All other information which the person making the report believes may be helpful in establishing the cause of the abuse or neglect and the identity of the person responsible for the abuse or neglect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the reporter was required to report under Washington D.C. law, the report must also contain the identity and occupation of the source, how to contact the source, and a statement of the actions by the source concerning the child.</p>\n<p>Washington D.C. law does not specifically address the confidentiality of the identity of the reporter or provide any protections to the reporter against retaliation or adverse employment action.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a title=\"\" id=\"_ftn1\" href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> See <a href=\"https://law.onecle.com/california/penal/11165.7.html\">https://law.onecle.com/california/penal/11165.7.html</a></p>\n<p><a title=\"\" id=\"_ftn2\" href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> The statute reads that “every person” is required to report.  N.M.S.A. § 32A-4-3 (a).  Despite the statute’s plain language, the New Mexico Court of Appeals has held that that words “every person” only mean the professionals specifically identified in the statute (i.e. the professionals listed in the preceding bullet points).  <em>State v. Strauch</em>, 2014-NMCA-020, 317 P.3d 878, 881 (N.M. Ct.App. 2013). The New Mexico Supreme Court has decided to review this question. <em>State v. Strauch</em>, 321 P.3d 936 (N.M. Ct. App. 2014) (granting cert). Middlebury’s handling of related issues will comply with New Mexico law as applicable at the relevant time.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/minors-on-campus","title":"C.5.
