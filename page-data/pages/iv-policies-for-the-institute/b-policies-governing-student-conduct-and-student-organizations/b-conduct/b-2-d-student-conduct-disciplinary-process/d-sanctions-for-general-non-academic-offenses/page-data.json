Sanctions are designed to accomplish several goals to deter harmful conduct; to cultivate responsibility and accountability to self and others; to address the underlying harm including the wellbeing or safety of any individual and/or the community; to eliminate any hostile environment, prevent its recurrence, and correct its discriminatory effects on the complainant and others, if applicable; and to provide other appropriate forms of redress.</p>\n<p>Sanctions are recorded in the student's file, and are not reflected on the academic transcript, except that Institute enrollment dates are part of the transcript record. Sanctions that constitute a form of official discipline, as noted below, are included in a student’s permanent record and may/must be disclosed by the respondent and/or by the Institute under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>Sanctions may additionally include loss or restriction of Institute privileges and/or educational/reparative assignments as appropriate. Prior conduct and judicial history may be taken into account in determining sanctions. Receipt of sanctions may also impact future Institute opportunities, including but not limited to employment, leadership position selection, or approval for participation in other Institute programs.</p>\n<p>If the conduct occurred during the course and scope of the student’s employment at the Institute, the matter will be referred to the Human Resources Department, as appropriate, for disciplinary sanctions that may include written reprimands, or termination of employment in addition to the sanctions assigned through the judicial process.</p>\n<p>Although discipline is cumulative at the Institute, which may result in greater sanctions for repeated or accumulated violations, it is not progressive. That is, depending on the severity of the violation, a student may receive any of the sanctions below, even for a first offense. Sanctions for offenses involving alcohol and/or drugs will be assigned to be consistent with those outlined below and in the Alcohol and Drug Use Policy.</p>\n<p>The sanctions below are listed in order of increasing severity.</p>\n<h4><strong>1. Unofficial Forms of Discipline</strong></h4>\n<h4><strong><span style=\"color:#660000\">a. Warnings</span></strong></h4>\n<p>A verbal or written warning may be issued when a student has violated Institute policy. A warning is intended to educate the student about Institute policies and/or state laws, and the need to adhere to them. A warning is informal, unofficial discipline and is not part of the student's official record. Students who receive a warning can answer negatively if they are asked if they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Institute program. Warnings are taken into account in determining future disciplinary outcomes and may serve to make further violations of Institute regulations more serious.</p>\n<h4><strong><span style=\"color:#660000\">b. Reprimands</span></strong></h4>\n<p>A letter of reprimand may be issued when a student demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to abide by our principles and by repeatedly violating Institute policy. A letter of reprimand may also be issued when a student has committed a violation of the Institute policy that has had or may have had a negative impact on an individual or on the community. A reprimand registers strongly the Institute’s concern regarding the student’s actions and its firm expectations for immediate improved behavior.</p>\n<p>A letter of reprimand is informal, unofficial discipline and is not part of the student’s official record. Students who receive reprimands can answer negatively if they are asked if they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Institute program. Reprimands are taken into account in determining future disciplinary outcomes and may serve to make further violations of Institute regulations more serious.</p>\n<h4><strong><span style=\"color:#660000\">c. Probationary Status</span></strong></h4>\n<p>Students may be placed on probationary status when the number or nature of their Institute policy violation(s) is sufficiently concerning that an additional policy violation will most likely result in an official form of discipline (please see below). Probationary status provides students with an opportunity to avoid this outcome. They may do so by demonstrating improved conduct, generally reflected in their sustained ability to respect community standards and adhere to Institute policies.</p>\n<p>If students commit new policy violations while on probationary status, an appropriate course of action will be determined. Considerations may include the gravity and impact of the new infraction; the student’s response during and following the new infraction; and the student’s progress during the probationary period.</p>\n<p>Probationary status is informal, unofficial discipline and is not part of the student’s official record. Students who are placed on probationary status can answer negatively if they are asked if they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Institute program. It is important to note that discipline is cumulative at the Institute and further infractions following the successful conclusion of the probationary period may still result in more severe outcomes.</p>\n<h4><strong>2. Official Forms of Discipline</strong></h4>\n<h4><strong><span style=\"color:#660000\">a. Letter of Official Discipline</span></strong></h4>\n<p>Students may receive a letter of official discipline when their actions have demonstrated disregard for the Institute’s policies such that an additional infraction of Institute policy will most likely result in suspension from the Institute. A letter of official discipline is intended to encourage immediate improved behavior and acceptance of responsibility and growth by establishing this incident on the student's permanent record.</p>\n<p>Letters of official discipline are a permanent part of the student's official record. Students who receive a letter of official discipline must answer affirmatively if they are asked whether they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Institute program.</p>\n<h4><strong><span style=\"color:#660000\">b. Suspension</span></strong></h4>\n<p>Suspension is issued when a student commits a serious policy violation, or repeatedly violates Institute policy, thereby demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to behave in a manner consistent with Institute principles. The behavior is sufficiently egregious that the student is required to leave the Institute community for a period of time. It is intended to encourage acceptance of responsibility and growth by establishing this incident on the student's permanent record; to provide the student with an opportunity to consider and address the problematic behavior; and to develop strategies to ensure that the student’s eventual return to the Institute will be successful for the student, for the individuals affected by the student's actions, and for the community.</p>\n<p>Suspension may be imposed for any length of time, but is normally imposed for a period no longer than one academic year. In determining the length of suspension, the sanctioning authority will consider the student’s prior conduct history; the gravity of the violation and its impact on the community; the needs of the complainant/affected party; and the need for sufficient time for the student to demonstrate that the concerning behavior has been satisfactorily addressed. When the sanctioning authority feels that suspension for one academic year is insufficient to allow for a student’s successful return to the community, expulsion will be the normal outcome, barring exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p>Students who are suspended for four weeks or longer who wish to return to or be reinstated at the Institute must apply for readmission or reinstatement. Students must apply through the dean of their school/ program. All applicants for readmission or reinstatement after suspension must demonstrate readiness to return to the Institute. Readiness to return is determined by a student’s adherence to the terms of the sanction and the deadlines of the readmission process; by the completion of any additional conditions that may have been established at the time of the student’s departure; and by the provision of satisfactory evidence that the problematic behavior will not recur. If a student is unable to demonstrate readiness to return at the stated conclusion of the period of suspension, the appropriate supervisory authority may deny readmission or reinstatement until it is satisfied that the conditions that led to the student’s departure have been appropriately addressed.</p>\n<p>Suspension is a form of official discipline and is a permanent part of the student's record. Students who are suspended must answer affirmatively if they are asked whether they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Institute program. Students who are suspended must leave campus; are restricted from all Institute-owned or rented properties; and are prohibited from participating in all Institute activities or programs, from employment by the Institute, and from using Institute facilities during the stated period of the suspension. When suspension prohibits students from completing a semester or program they have already begun, the comprehensive fee for that semester or program is not refunded. For international students, suspension may affect immigration status; related questions may be directed to the director of international student and scholar services.</p>\n<h4><strong><span style=\"color:#660000\">c. Expulsion</span></strong></h4>\n<p>For particularly serious offenses, students may be permanently expelled from the Institute. In cases of expulsion from the Institute, no refund of the comprehensive fee or other program fee, as applicable, is made. Expulsion is a form of official discipline and is a permanent part of the student's record. Students who are expelled must answer affirmatively if they are asked whether they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Institute program.</p>\n<p>Fines or restitution commensurate with the nature of the offense may also be assigned. The monetary cost of the harm done may be taken into account in assessment of a fine or an order of restitution.</p>\n<p>A sanction of suspension or expulsion is ordinarily stayed pending the outcome of any authorized appeal. However, if the judicial authority which imposed this sanction makes a finding that imminent danger to one or more members of the Institute community may exist, suspension or expulsion will take effect immediately regardless of the pendency of an appeal.
