However, if an insufficient number of faculty members are able to serve on FEC without such a conflict for a full three years, then as an exception, faculty members may, 1. when the issue precluding their service is contract renewal or promotion (during what would otherwise be the third year of their term), run for and serve on the FEC for a term of 2 consecutive years or 2. when the issue precluding their service is an application for sabbatical (to be submitted during the third year of their term), run for and serve a 3-year term, but recuse themselves from deliberations over their own sabbatical applications.</p>\n<p>Approved by the Faculty Assembly, May 2018.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/4-faculty-organization-and-governance","title":"C.4.
