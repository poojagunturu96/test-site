Limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the institution should be clearly stated in writing at the time of the appointment.</li>\n<li>College and university teachers are citizens, members of learned profession, and officers of an educational institution. When they speak or write as citizens, they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline, but their special position in the community imposes special obligations. As scholars and educational officers, they should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances. Hence they should at all times be accurate, should exercise appropriate restraint, should show respect for the opinions of others, and should make every effort to indicate that they are not speaking for the institution.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Student Rights and Freedomes in the Classroom</strong></p>\n<p>The professor in the classroom and in conference should encourage free discussion, inquiry, and expression. Student performance should be evaluated solely on an academic basis, not on opinions or conduct in matters unrelated to academic standards.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Protection of Freedom of Expression — Students should be free to take reasoned exception to the data or views offered in any course of study and to reserve judgment about matters of opinion, but they are responsible for learning the content of any course of study for which they are enrolled.</li>\n<li>Protection Against Improper Academic Evaluation — Students should have protection through orderly procedures against prejudiced or capricious academic evaluation. At the same time, they are responsible for maintaining standards of academic performance established for each course in which they are enrolled.</li>\n<li>Protection Against Improper Disclosure — Information about student view, beliefs, and political associations which professors acquire in the course of their work as instructors, advisers, and counselors should be considered confidential. Protection against improper disclosure is a serious professional obligation. Judgments of ability and character may be provided under appropriate circumstances, normally with the knowledge and consent of the student.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/appendix-b-aaup-guidelines","title":"Appendix B: AAUP Guidelines"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8ef41f0d-ca00-5735-ae42-fa7a51f2e195","frontmatter__slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/appendix-b-aaup-guidelines","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"pages"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2212765230","3000541721"]}
