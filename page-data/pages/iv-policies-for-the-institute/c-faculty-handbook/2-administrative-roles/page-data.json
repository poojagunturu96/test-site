In that capacity, the provost is involved in decision-making broadly across academic, financial, and operational spheres for the Institute.</p>\n<p>This section describes the major administrative roles at the Institute and outlines the relationship and responsibilities of the Faculty with respect to each. Faculty members should be consulted in the selection of the vice president for academic affairs and dean of the Institute.</p>\n<p><strong>C.2.a. Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Institute (VPAA)</strong></p>\n<p><abbr title=\"INSTITUTE COUNCIL The VPAA, along with the two school deans, and other administrators the VPAA may select, constitute the Institute Council. While an administrative body, the Council should consider input generated or collected by the Faculty Senate on Council decisions related to the academic program of MIIS, and decisions on faculty appointment evaluation.  INSTITUTE LEADERSHIP GROUP The Institute Leadership Group, convened by the VPAA, is a consultative body for decisions which affect the operations of the Institute. Faculty are represented on the ILG via the Faculty Senate President and/or the Faculty Senate Vice-President, as they so arrange, via the Faculty representative to the Institute Board of Overseers, and via the chair of the Academic Policies, Standards, and Instruction Committee.\">The VPAA is responsible for the overall management of the business and academic affairs of the Institute, including support in instruction, research, and development. In the exercise of the duties of the office, the VPAA meets with Faculty Senate when requested, and meets regularly with the Senate president and vice president, as well as consulting with other faculty representatives through the Institute Leadership Group, appropriate faculty committees, and the relevant deans.</abbr></p>\n<p>The VPAA is appointed by the president of Middlebury, and reports to the Middlebury provost. The VPAA is the Senior Administrative Officer serving as liaison to the Institute Board of Overseers.</p>\n<p>Due process should be followed in the selection of the VPAA. When a new Vice President of Academic Affairs/Dean of the Institute is select, Institute Faculty have the right to be meaningfully consulted in the selection. Feedback regarding the priorities for hiring and on the actual candidates should be gathered from the Faculty Assembly through a process designed and administered by the Faculty Senate, in conjunction with the current MIIS Council.</p>\n<p>As part of the process by which the VPAA is evaluated, the faculty should be consulted for input in the annual review of the VPAA.</p>\n<p>The VPAA directs the activities of other members of the staff, sees that the decisions and directives of the Institute Board of Advisors and the Middlebury Board of Trustees are implemented, and performs such other functions as the president and provost of Middlebury and the Institute Board of Advisors may require.</p>\n<p>The VPAA appoints senior administrators; deans, associate deans, program chairs, and other academic administrators; as well as regular faculty members.</p>\n<p>The VPAA appoints faculty members in accordance with processes described below. Faculty appointments are subject to the approval of the Middlebury Board of Trustees through its consent agenda.</p>\n<p>The VPAA, along with the Middlebury provost, oversees the Institute’s response to charges of faculty misconduct, including procedures for  termination of  the appointment of a faculty member, in accordance with the policies of the Faculty Handbook.</p>\n<p>Academic staff members are “at will” employees whose positions may be terminated at any time. (See Employee Handbook.)</p>\n<p><strong>C.2.b. Deans</strong></p>\n<p>A dean provides academic leadership and administrative management for a school of the Institutel. Deans articulate the interests of their schools, as well as coordinate with other Middlebury administrators on policies and decisions requiring collaboration. Deans ensure the effective formulation and implementation of academic policies, curriculum planning and development, budgeting, faculty recruitment and evaluation, and faculty development.</p>\n<p>Deans also work with the offices of Institutional Advancement and Alumni Relations; Marketing and Recruitment; Admissions, and Financial Aid; the Registrar’s Office; the Business Office; the Communications office, and other academic and administrative services, and with the Institute Board of Overseers when necessary or requested.</p>\n<p>Deans serve as liaisons with professional associations, as well as with academic, business, and professional communities, helping to increase the visibility of their schools and the Institute as a whole.</p>\n<p>School deans (GSTILE, GSIPM) may have two appointments. First, they may have a regular faculty appointment, the specific term of which is held in abeyance (does not run) while they serve as dean. Second, as administrators, deans report to the VPAA. Their appointment is normally for a scheduled term of three (3) years and is renewable. However, the VPAA has the authority to terminate these administrative appointments at any time prior to the three-year term. On termination of the administrative appointment, the faculty contract, if one is held, resumes and the dean has the option to resume regular faculty status under the faculty contract, unless the VPAA terminates the appointment of a faculty member in accordance with the process defined in this Faculty Handbook based upon conduct in their role as dean.</p>\n<p>The relationships between the deans and Institute faculty is an important link between administrators and faculty at the Institute. It is at the school level that most academic matters arise and that the most important step in faculty evaluation takes place. A basic principle in the governance of the Institute is that deans consult their faculty on a regular basis. It is at the school level that faculty have the most authority and responsibility, and that mutual respect and consultation are most critical. One factor in establishing and maintaining this relationship is the active participation of faculty in the selection and evaluation of deans.</p>\n<p>When the position of a school dean becomes open, a search committee shall be formed, composed of the VPAA, three regular faculty members of that school selected by the school faculty, and one regular faculty member of the other school selected by that other school’s faculty. The search committee shall also actively seek input from students and relevant staff and be trained on diversity.This committee shall normally normally conduct an international search.</p>\n<p>The committee shall approve the interviewing of at least three (3) finalists recommended by the committee. These candidates shall be interviewed by the search committee, the regular faculty of the school, the other deans, staff representatives, and student representatives.</p>\n<p>The search committee shall gather and summarize comments on each candidate and create a ranked list of finalists from whom the VPAA makes the final selection.</p>\n<p>Evaluation of the deans is conducted by the VPAA according to guidelines in the Employee Handbook. The VPAA shall establish a process to solicit input from the faculty of the respective schools. This process of gathering input shall be completed by March 20th, so that faculty input can be taken into account in the VPAA's evaluation.</p>\n<p><strong>C.2.c. Program Chairs</strong></p>\n<p>Program chairs are uniquely situated at the intersection of faculty and governance and administration. It is important that individuals in these roles are able to work well with both the faculty in their programs and with the deans who oversee their programs. Therefore, it is essential that the appointment of program chairs be a <abbr title=\" (a) The Dean of each Graduate School develops a formal process for gathering nominations from the full-time and visiting faculty members of the program to be chaired. (b) The Dean must then solicit faculty input on the nominations either through in-person conversations or through an online survey. Those who are nominated will be invited to share their vision of program development and management. (c) The aim would be to achieve consensus among faculty members in a program (d) Final decisions will be made by the VPAA taking into consideration both the discussions with Deans and the program faculty (or relevant others that that program chair would interface with) and the voting results.   Program chairs should serve a maximum two three-year terms, in order to share the load and to give multiple faculty a chance to lead. Current program chairs who have been serving more than six years would be grandfathered in, but encouraged to plan for a transition to another colleague.\"><em>collaborative and consultative process</em></abbr>. Program Chairs are appointed by the VPAA and report to the Dean of their graduate school with an initial appointment of one three-year term, with the possibility of a single second term extension. A third term should only be granted if that faculty member is the only willing candidate and there is consensus among program faculty. In order for their appointment to be extended for each additional term, the Dean must confidentially consult all faculty in the program. The VPAA in conjunction with the deans shall retain the discretion for early termination of the appointment of the chair of the program.</p>\n<p>The dean is responsible for evaluating the program chair on an annual basis, although the Faculty Senate shall establish the procedures used to formatively evaluate program chairs, based on the description of duties developed by each program. Evaluations emanating from this process shall be forwarded to the dean, with the program chair being given an opportunity to respond. This process of gathering input shall be completed by April 30. The Senate maintains the formative evaluation form, and if changes are felt necessary by the dean or the faculty, the Senate will make such changes based on faculty input. The deans distribute the formative evaluation, receive the results, and review the results with the program chair.</p>\n<p><strong>C.2.d. Language-program-specific administrators</strong></p>\n<p>Deans may appoint, in coordination with program faculty and especially program chairs, language-program-specific administrators within more complex programs.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">1. Role of Language Program Director in T&#x26;I</p>\n<p>In Translation and Interpretation, the Language Program Director (LPD) is responsible for staffing his/her program with qualified professors. The (LPD), in coordination with the T&#x26;I Program Chair and the Dean, will select candidates for an open position, interview the candidates and then make a recommendation to the Dean. The (LPD) is also responsible for the schedule each semester and coordinates with the (LPD)s in the other language programs. The (LPD) is also the mediator between students and a faculty member and only escalates an issue to the T&#x26;I Program Chair and/or Dean if it cannot be solved by the (LPD). The (LPD) keeps records of interim evaluations for every student. The (LPD) is responsible to have LSTs graded and will then contact the applicant after an applicant passes this early diagnostic test. The (LPD) stays in contact with the applicant and is available for any questions pertaining to the course of study. The (LPD) serves as academic advisor for all students in the Translation, Translation &#x26; Interpretation, and Conference Interpretation programs in their language.  The (LPD) meets once a month with the (LPD)s of the other language programs to coordinate any efforts.  The (LPD) also plays a very important role in recruiting students for the program.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">2. Role of Language Studies Language Coordinator</p>\n<p>The Language Studies Coordinator plays a key role in supporting students’ learning and providing the necessary support to the language instructors. Each language studies program has its own coordinator whose job is to arrange the schedule for each semester and supervise the placement test for incoming students. The Coordinator’s responsibilities also include the organization of the co-curricular activities and the academic advising for students who plan to study abroad or attend immersive language programs. The Coordinator provides regular program updates to colleagues and meets with them once a month to discuss various pedagogical issues and ways to improve the curriculum and assessment within the language program. In addition, the Coordinator works as the liaison between the specific language unit and the other language programs within the LS Department. Each Coordinator reports directly to the Dean and attends the Coordinators’ monthly meeting as well as the LS meeting led by the Language Studies Program Chair and Dean. Besides these tasks, the LS Coordinators respond to inquiries about the specific language they represent and provide information about the academic component of the program. LS Coordinators also play a key role in recruiting students for the Institute, much of which is done via language departments at various partner schools.  LS Coordinators also supervise the Teaching Assistants and provide the necessary training for them.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/2-administrative-roles","title":"C.2.
