Teaching is neither restricted to a narrow subject area nor limited to the classroom; it extends to every student contact and often into the community. Each faculty member should recognize her/his responsibility for campus morale and for the total school experience of the students. Faculty should also become appropriately involved in the promotion and overall development of the Institute, when called upon to do so and in accordance with their schedules and duties.</p>\n<p><strong>C.3.a. Curricula and degree programs</strong></p>\n<p>Faculty in each degree and non-degree program have the primary role in determining degree requirements, but this must follow the curricular change process, which ensures consultation with all affected parties.</p>\n<p><strong>C.3.b.

Academic Freedom and Intellectual Contribution</strong></p>\n<p>The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey is a graduate school of Middlebury, a private, independent educational institution owing allegiance to no party, sect, or interest group. Its overall goal is the promotion of intellectual inquiry and search for improved means of understanding and communication among peoples through free expression.</p>\n<p>Recognizing that free inquiry is essential in higher education, the Institute abides by the principles of academic freedom and student rights as advocated by the American Association of University Professors.
