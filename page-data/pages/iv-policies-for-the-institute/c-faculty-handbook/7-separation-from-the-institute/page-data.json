Non-Retention</strong></p>\n<p>Regular faculty members whose non-retention is decided upon pursuant to the evaluation process are entitled to receive a Notice of Non-Retention. All Notices of Non-Retention shall be in writing and shall be served either personally or by registered or certified mail in accordance with the established schedule (see <a href=\"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/appendix-a-faculty-evaluation-schedule\">Appendix A</a>), namely no later than June 30, or approximately a year prior to the expiration of an appointment.</p>\n<p><strong>C.7.b. Separation for Cause</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to non-retention pursuant to the evaluation process outlined in section <a href=\"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/6-evaluation-of-the-faculty#eval-process\">C.6.h.</a>, faculty may be separated for cause for engaging in prohibited conduct in accordance with the procedures for responding to faculty misconduct, described in section <a href=\"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/8-other-faculty-matters#discipline\">C.8.g.</a></p>\n<p><strong>C.7.c. Reduction in Program</strong></p>\n<p>A critical lack of funds and/or the discontinuance or reduction of a program may necessitate a reduction in faculty. Such a situation can be considered grounds for non-renewal of a contract. The administration should share with faculty the criteria used to decide whether programs are subject to reduction or discontinuance and also the factors weighed to evaluate contract renewal decisions within these programs, so that other faculty can shape their future performance.</p>\n<p>Before any non-renewal of contract is decided upon that ground, the VPAA shall consult with appropriate dean and the provost, as appropriate, in order to seek alternative ways to employ affected faculty members within Middlebury.Â  Except in true financial emergencies, every attempt should be made to honor faculty contracts for their entire length, in order to preserve the Institute's ability to recruit qualified faculty for its future needs.</p>\n<p><strong>C.7.d. Resignation</strong></p>\n<p>A member of the faculty is expected to furnish written notice of resignation as early as possible but not later than December 1, if the resignation is to be effective the following academic year. By mutual and written agreement between the faculty member and their dean, shorter notice may be given.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/7-separation-from-the-institute","title":"C.7.
