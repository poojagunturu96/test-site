A leave of absence is approved for one year at a time, and the student must request an extension to continue the leave into a second year.</p>\n<p>In order to register for a leave of absence, the student must file a petition for a Leave of Absence form in the Records Office and a non-refundable deposit of $150 must be paid by 4 P.M. on the third day of the first term of absence (Fall or Spring; Summer term is excepted). The deposit is applicable toward the studentâ€™s tuition upon returning to the Institute. Unless this procedure is followed, a returning student must apply for readmission through the Admissions Office and pay another application fee. Please obtain the petition for a Leave of Absence from the Records Office. <strong>International students</strong> may be required to leave the U.S. during a leave of absence if they have not officially transferred to another academic institution or applied for a change of status through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).</p>\n<p><strong>Students should be aware that since they are not enrolled during a leave of absence, this might cause student loan payments to fall due.</strong> Students receiving any federal financial aid and/or a Middlebury Institute scholarship should obtain advice and instructions on leaves of absence from the Office of Student Financial Services and schedule an exit interview, which is required by federal regulations.</p>\n<p>In the event that a student is going on a leave of absence in order to pursue a degree program-related internship, fellowship or Peace Corps service, the settlement of tuition overloads before departure may be waived by completing the required Leave of Absence Petition. However, if a student fails to return and re-enroll, he/she is liable for those charges at the prevailing rate. The petition is available from the Records Office. <strong>Note:</strong> Students going on a leave of absence for any other reason are required to pay their overload credits before leaving the Institute. Please see Course Load and Overload section, above.</p>\n<p>Upon return from a leave of absence, the student must have no outstanding balance due and have a $150 non-refundable deposit on account. The $150 tuition deposit will be applied against billed tuition in the returning semester. The deposit is good for a maximum of two years, after which the student must re-apply for admission to the Institute. <strong>Note:</strong> No student will be allowed to register if there is a balance due on his or her tuition account.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/a-academic-policies/a-8-leaves-of-absence-withdrawal-suspension-expulsion-and-graduation/a-8-a-leave-of-absence-student-initiated","title":"A.8.a.
