If those calculations result in the school being required to return funds to one or more of the Title IV (federal aid) programs, it must do so. In many cases such a return of funds by the school will reduce the student's loan debt. An institution, however, is not required to collect an overpayment of grant funds based on the Return of Title IV Funds calculation for such a student. Therefore, the school is not required to contact the student, notify NSLDS, or refer the overpayment to the Department in these cases.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/a-academic-policies/a-8-leaves-of-absence-withdrawal-suspension-expulsion-and-graduation/a-8-g","title":"A.8.g.
