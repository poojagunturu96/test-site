A change of grade may be requested <strong>only</strong> when a calculation, clerical, administrative, or recording error is discovered in the original assignment of a course grade or when a decision is made by a faculty member to change the grade as a result of the disputed academic evaluation procedure. Grade changes necessitated by a calculation, clerical, administrative, or recording error must be reported within a period of six months from the time the grade is awarded. <strong>No grade may be changed as the result of a re-evaluation of a student’s work or the submission of supplemental work</strong> following the close of a semester or marking period. The Records Office shall only accept permissible changes of grade upon written approval of the faculty member’s dean, who shall first verify that the Change of Grade request satisfies legitimate criteria.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/a-academic-policies/a-6-grades-credits-and-academic-policies/a-6-a-grades-and-credits","title":"A.6.a.
