Students who have not paid their tuition by the 20<sup>th</sup> business day of classes will not be permitted to continue until they have developed a payment plan acceptable to the Business Office. If the Business Office approves such a payment plan, the Institute nevertheless retains the discretion to revoke the registration at any subsequent time that the Institute determines that a student account has a negative balance, because payments have not been made in compliance with the payment plan. If the Institute thus revokes registration for a course or program, the student may not further attend those courses, nor may the student earn grades.</p>\n<p>Students who are being sponsored by other organizations for full or partial tuition are responsible for the Institute receiving these payments by the 20<sup>th</sup> business day of classes. If such payments are not possible by 20<sup>th</sup> businessday of classes, the student must provide the Business Office with written commitment from the sponsoring organization that full payment of tuition and fees will occur. Such written commitment must be on the letterhead of the sponsoring organization and must include the total amount the sponsoring organization will pay each semester, billing instructions, and the signature of the authorized representative of the sponsoring organization. If such written documentation is not provided by 4 PM on the 20<sup>th</sup> businessday of the semester, the late registration fee of $250 will be assessed. In this case it is the studentâ€™s responsibility to make arrangements for payment of the late fee in addition to the tuition and fees. If the Business Office approves such an external written commitment, the Institute nevertheless retains the discretion for subsequent revocation of the registration at any time that the Institute determines that a student account has a negative balance because payments have not been made in compliance with the external written commitment. If the Institute thus revokes registration for a course or program, the student may not further attend those courses, nor may the student earn grades.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/a-academic-policies/a-7-policies-concerning-enrollment-and-payment-fees\">Return to table of contents</a></h4>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/a-academic-policies/a-7-policies-concerning-enrollment-and-payment-fees/a-7-b-payment-of-fees","title":"A.7.b.
