With this representative membership, Community Council deliberations and decisions take into consideration the interests and concerns of the whole community. The diverse membership assures that each member of the council hears and understands the views of the other sections of the community, thus linking the four groups that compose the Middlebury College community.</p>\n<p>The Community Council has a dual role in the College governance structure. Sometimes the council makes decisions and then implements those decisions as College policy. On certain matters, the council serves as an advisory body to the president and the administration.</p>\n<p>Community Council meetings follow a basic Robert’s Rules of Order format.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Authority</strong></p>\n<p>a. The Community Council considers policies and issues in all areas pertaining to the nonacademic life of the College in which students, faculty, and/or staff share mutual concerns.</p>\n<p>b. The Community Council may recommend actions to the president and administration on matters in which the council has an interest, but cannot be held accountable (legally or financially) for the consequences of decisions made. Examples include handbook policy changes and creation/termination of social/academic interest houses.  The Council also receives questions or matters for deliberation from the President and the Senior Leadership Group.  In this consultative capacity, the Council will offer direct feedback to the President and SLG, and will frequently reach out to others for input before forwarding the opinion(s) of the Council.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Legislated Duties</strong></p>\n<p>a. Responsibilities</p>\n<p>i.
