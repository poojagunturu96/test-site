A budget for exhibition of works of public art on loan will be established before loans are accepted.</p>\n<p>Bearing in mind recent legal discussions about the rights of artists concerning the discussion, alteration, and placement of works of art, the College will take such ethical considerations into account when choosing and negotiating for works of art to be displayed in public places.</p>\n<p>CAPP will have the right to deaccession works guided by the same standards used by the Collections Committee of the Museum.</p>\n<p><strong>3.  <em>Policy for the temporary exhibition of works of art on the Middlebury campus</em></strong></p>\n<p>CAPP does not presume any authority over works of art, photographs, etc., that faculty and staff place on view in their offices, that departments choose to install in their offices and teaching spaces, that students place in their rooms, that Commons choose for their lounges.</p>\n<p>CAPP welcomes temporary installations in public spaces organized by departments or individuals. There is no need for CAPP to monitor short exhibits (three weeks or less), but such presentations must always be clearly labeled to indicate their source and the educational purpose that lies behind them.</p>\n<p>CAPP, or the on-campus subcommittee of CAPP, which has been authorized to make practical decisions that are too cumbersome to be managed by the Committee as a whole, must approve any work or works to be placed on view for a longer period. (This subcommittee consists of the chair of CAPP, the director and curator of modern and contemporary art at the Museum, the director of the arts, the director of the Program in Studio Art and the chair of the Department of the History of Art and Architecture.)</p>\n<p>When a work or works are approved for temporary exhibition, the length of time it/they will be on view must be clearly indicated and stipulated in writing, indicating the agreement between the installer and the subcommittee. Normally, an academic year would be the longest time for such an exhibition. If the department or individual wishes, a request may be made at the end of the designated period to extend the exhibition, or to acquire the work or works for permanent installation. If CAPP does not approve the extension, the work or works must be removed.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/commun-policies/a-8-committee-on-art-in-public-places","title":"A.8.
