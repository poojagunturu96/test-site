Shifts are identified in BannerWeb as Shift 1 (day), Shift 2 (evening), and Shift 3 (nights). For example, an employee who works 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. would enter 3 hours in Shift 2 (9 p.m.–12 a.m.) and 5 hours in Shift 3 (12 a.m.–5 a.m.). Shift differentials are paid only for hours worked and are included in the calculation of overtime pay rates. Differentials are not paid for CTO, SLR, bereavement, holiday, and other time off.</p>\n<p>Departmental exceptions to this policy must be approved by Human Resources. Ineligible positions include tipped employee jobs and student jobs (contact Human Resources for complete list).  Shift differential amounts will be periodically reviewed.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/wage-salary/shift-differentials","title":"6.4 Shift Differentials"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"52c73fa4-1822-5bd9-a7ed-cd63e168bb02","frontmatter__slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/wage-salary/shift-differentials","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"pages"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2212765230","3000541721"]}
