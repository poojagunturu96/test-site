Personal LOAs are discretionary and require approval from both the employee’s manager and from Human Resources. The minimum duration is one full pay period, and a Personal LOA may not exceed one year in duration. (Managers may, at their discretion, approve shorter absences without the formal Personal LOA process).</p>\n<p>During an approved Personal LOA an employee will receive no regular pay. Certain employee benefits may be negotiated with Human Resources during the approval process. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>whether or not the employee will continue to be eligible for employee benefits during the LOA;</li>\n<li>if benefits continue, whether the employee will pay the employee-only portion of the cost or the full cost of the benefit;</li>\n<li>if applicable, how the employee will pay for the benefits during the LOA (i.e. pre-pay, pay-as-you-go, etc.); and</li>\n<li>whether or not the employee will be required to use accrued CTO time during the LOA (this is typical).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to request a Personal LOA, employees should contact the Human Resources office to initiate the application process.</p>\n<p>Non-exempt and exempt employees on approved Personal LOAs <em>do not</em> accrue CTO time on the unpaid portion of the leave. CTO will accrue only on CTO hours used during the leave.</p>\n<p>During an approved Personal Leave of Absence, employees have the same job protection afforded active employees.</p>\n<p>Employees needing time off for medical reasons or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition should refer to the <em><a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/time-away/family-medical-leave\">Family and Medical Leave Act policy</a></em>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/time-away/personal-leave","title":"4.10 Personal Leave of Absence"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"56f067d8-03e5-5258-91d9-421bf4a5a62e","frontmatter__slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/time-away/personal-leave","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"pages"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2212765230","3000541721"]}
