Eligibility for paid time off benefits is based on employment classification and work state: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>benefits-eligible staff employees fall under the CTO policy,</li>\n<li>benefits-eligible faculty members have FLR, and</li>\n<li>certain student employees as well as non-benefits eligible faculty and staff employees <em>who work in Vermont</em> may be eligible for VEST. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Employees should refer to the Combined Time Off, Faculty Sick Leave Reserve or Vermont Earned Sick Time policies for specific eligibility and benefit provisions.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/time-away/4-13-vermont-earned-sick-time-act","title":"4.13 Vermont Earned Sick Time Act"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7d1015a2-cf01-5b9e-986c-2eb42567b97b","frontmatter__slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/time-away/4-13-vermont-earned-sick-time-act","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"pages"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2212765230","3000541721"]}
