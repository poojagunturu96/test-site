The College does not discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities in any aspect of the employment relationship, and does provide reasonable accommodations as required by law to otherwise qualified employees or applicants with disabilities.Â Employment opportunities or privileges will not be denied to an otherwise qualified employee or applicant because of the need for reasonable accommodation of the individual's disability. Discrimination based on an employee's or applicant's association with a disabled individual is also forbidden. Employees with ADA-related concerns should contact Human Resources.</p>\n<p><em>See also this website:</em><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/business/hr/staffandfaculty/policies/procedures\">Middlebury College Human Resources Procedures: ADA Compliance</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/employment/ada","title":"2.2 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"35a2c493-9d50-562e-8ad8-25f465038e90","frontmatter__slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/employment/ada","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"pages"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2212765230","3000541721"]}
