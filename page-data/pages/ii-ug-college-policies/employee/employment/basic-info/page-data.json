Before being placed on the payroll, new employees must complete the necessary federal forms at the Human Resources office.</p>\n<p><strong>Form I-9</strong></p>\n<p>The College, in accordance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, is committed to employing only those applicants authorized to work in the United States. As a condition of employment, all new and rehired employees must properly complete, sign, and date the first section of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Form I-9 by his or her first day of employment. The employee's documents must be reviewed and section 2 completed within three business days of the first day of work. An employee who does not properly complete the I-9 form within the legally required timeframe will not be permitted to continue to work until the form is completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Personnel Records and Changes in Personal Status</strong></p>\n<p>Employees are responsible for taking an active role in keeping their records current and accurate. Notification to Human Resources of any changes in personal status is critical. Such information is necessary to ensure correct coverage and, if appropriate, deductions for taxes, medical insurance, life insurance, etc. Incorrect or outdated information may affect employee benefits and the ability of the College to make the appropriate contacts in an emergency. The accuracy of an employee's entry in the College directory depends on the accuracy of that employee's files. Some changes that should be reported promptly include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Home address</li>\n<li>Telephone number</li>\n<li>Marital status</li>\n<li>Names and social security numbers of dependents</li>\n<li>Birth dates of dependents</li>\n<li>Changes in dependent(s) status</li>\n<li>Changes in emergency contact information</li>\n<li>Beneficiary designations for benefit plans, such as retirement plan, life insurance, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Employees may review the personal information in their personnel files by setting up an appointment with a representative of Human Resources. One business day notice is required.</p>\n<p>Failure to notify Human Resources of changes or falsification of records may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>\n<p><strong>Categories of Employment</strong></p>\n<p>A series of employment categories identify the type of position held by each staff and faculty member. The employee's position type should be included in the letter notifying him or her of employment.</p>\n<p>If at any time, an employee is unclear about the type of appointment s/he holds, the employee should seek clarification from either the department head or Human Resources. See <a href=\"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/benefits\">section 3, Employee Benefits</a> for benefit eligibility information.</p>\n<p><em>Faculty members</em> teach students. Faculty titles include: professor, associate professor, assistant professor, instructor, visiting assistant professor, visiting instructor, lecturer, visiting lecturer, and assistant in instruction.</p>\n<p><em>Staff members</em> are hired to perform non-teaching duties in support of the College's academic mission.</p>\n<p>Middlebury College classifies faculty and staff members according to the chart below. The primary basis for classification is committed hours for staff and instructional units for faculty. Committed hours are regularly scheduled and budgeted hours assigned to a specific position. Regardless of the number of hours actually worked, on-call positions have no committed hours. Human Resources will work collaboratively with managers to determine the classification of each position.</p>\n<p><strong>Employee Group Classifications -
