Employees are encouraged to take advantage of this period to determine whether the position meets their expectations and to get clarification concerning responsibilities. The College will use this period to evaluate an employee's capabilities and work habits. Either the College or the employee may end the employment relationship at will, with or without cause. Certain departments or positions may have longer provisional periods.</p>\n<p>If an employee is absent from work for any significant period of time as defined by the supervisor during the first three months, the provisional period will be extended by the length of the absence automatically. If the College determines that it has not had sufficient time for a thorough evaluation of the employee's performance, it may choose to extend the provisional period for a specified length of time. The employee's supervisor will notify the employee of any extension, its length and reason.</p>\n<p>Provisional employment status does not affect eligibility for employer-provided benefits. The terms and conditions of each determine eligibility for such programs.</p>\n<p>If newly hired, transferred or promoted, an employee will receive a performance appraisal after one month and at the completion of the provisional period. Subsequent reviews occur annually between January and March, with a mid-year performance discussion every six months.</p>\n<p>The provisional period may be waived at the discretion of the department or Human Resources.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/employment/provisional-period","title":"2.8 Provisional Period"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"620e878d-ef95-5163-874f-3dad30e32ca4","frontmatter__slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/employment/provisional-period","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"pages"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2212765230","3000541721"]}
