The College also adheres to DOT requirements for those employees who hold a commercial driver's license as part of their position responsibilities for travel within the state. Such employees are subject to the controlled substance and alcohol testing rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Policy Statement:</strong> A driver is forbidden to consume or be under the influence of alcohol within four hours of going on duty, while on duty, or while driving, and up to 8 hours following an accident or until the employee undergoes a post-accident test, whichever occurs first.   A driver on duty is forbidden to possess, be under the influence of, or use any Schedule I drug substance, including any amphetamine or formulation of an amphetamine, narcotics or derivatives, or any other substance that makes driving unsafe.</p>\n<p>All employees who hold a commercial driver's license as part of their position responsibilities for travel within the state are required to participate in controlled substance/alcohol testing. This includes testing for pre-employment, random, post-accident, reasonable suspicion, and return to duty testing and follow up testing.  For these employees, participation in the testing program is a condition of employment at Middlebury College.</p>\n<p>Note that the ability to use a CDL license may be affected by violations incurred driving a private vehicle.  Employees with a CDL license must notify their supervisor within 24 hours of conviction of a violation in ANY vehicle.  Employees must also notify their supervisor if their regular driver's license is suspended.  Employees who fail to notify the College as requested may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Controlled Substances Testing</span></p>\n<p>Testing is performed by analyzing a driver's urine specimen. All urine specimens are analyzed for marijuana (THC metabolite), cocaine, amphetamines, opiates (including heroin), and phencyclidine (PCP).</p>\n<p>When contacted for testing, the driver will provide a urine specimen, which will be subdivided into two bottles. If the analysis of the primary specimen indicates the presence of illegal, controlled substances, the driver has 72 hours to request the split specimen be sent to another DHHS-certified laboratory for analysis.</p>\n<p>If a driver has a positive drug test result, the driver will be interviewed by a Medical Review Officer (MRO) to determine if the positive drug test resulted from the unauthorized use of a controlled substance. If the MRO determines that unauthorized use has occurred, the driver will be removed from safety-sensitive duty, and cannot return to such duties until s/he has been evaluated by a substance abuse professional, has complied with recommended rehabilitation, and has a negative result on a return-to-duty drug test. Follow-up testing to monitor the driver's continued abstinence from drug use will be conducted.</p>\n<p>Use of vehicles requiring a CDL is prohibited while using controlled substances, except when the use is at the instruction of a physician who has advised the driver that the substance does not adversely affect the ability to safely operate a Commercial Motor Vehicle.</p>\n<p>Drivers who engage in prohibited controlled substance conduct will be immediately removed from safety functions, and cannot return until they have been evaluated by a substance abuse professional and complied with any treatment recommendations. Drivers will also be subject to disciplinary action, up and including termination.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Alcohol Testing</span></p>\n<p>Testing is performed using the driver's breath.</p>\n<p>Drivers who have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 when tested just prior to, during, or immediately following performing safety-sensitive functions will be removed from performing such duties for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Use of vehicles requiring a CDL is prohibited while using alcohol, while having a breath alcohol concentration of 0.04 percent or greater as indicated by an alcohol breath test, and/or within four hours after using alcohol.</p>\n<p>Drivers who engage in prohibited alcohol conduct will be immediately removed from safety functions, and cannot return until they have been evaluated by a substance abuse professional and complied with any treatment recommendations. Drivers will also be subject to disciplinary action, up and including termination.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Procedures</span></p>\n<p>In all cases, the privacy of the employee and the confidentiality of testing records and results will be strictly maintained by Middlebury College.  The integrity of the test process will be maintained.  Test results will be attributed to the correct driver.</p>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"125\">\n<p><strong>Physical Examinations</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"432\">\n<ul>\n<li>An employee holding a CDL as part of his/her position description will submit to a medical examination every 2 years.
