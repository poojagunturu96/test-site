The College will assist faculty with production costs and reprint costs for scholarly publications through the <em>Scholarly Publication Subvention Fund (SPSF).</em>  All requests should be made using the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/454905/original/spsfform_august_2013.docx\">application</a> available on the Academic Affairs webpage and sent to the Office of the Dean for Faculty Development and Research (DFDR). Additionally, the College shares faculty scholarship through an open access repository.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Reprints.</strong> Assistance will be in the form of the cost of 100 reprints, normally not to exceed $300 for a single set.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Page Charges, Submission Fees, and Copyright Fees for articles.</strong> There is a maximum grant amount of $2,000 per article.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Scholarly Books and Artistic Works.</strong> Assistance will be provided (as funding permits) for tenured and tenure-track faculty and faculty whose appointments make them eligible to serve on Faculty Council (as defined by the faculty in November 2013) to cover production costs when an academic publisher requires a subvention as a condition for publication.  It may also be used for indexing, copyright or permission fees, or copyediting (i.e., copyediting of the final version of a manuscript after it has been accepted for publication).  The funds for copyediting will only be paid to an independently-hired editor (not to the publishing press).  The maximum grant amount for each book project is $2,500 and repayment is not required.  Because of the financial pressures affecting the world of publishing, there may be special circumstances that would warrant additional subvention support.  Faculty members may also apply to the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty (VPAA/DOF) for a loan to cover production costs in excess of $2,500.  Such loans are to be repaid by payroll deduction over a period not to exceed 24 months at an interest rate to be established at the beginning of each academic year.  The remaining terms will be negotiated between the applicant and the VPAA/DOF as part of the application process.</p>\n<p>Applications may be submitted at any time and must include a written contract with a publisher (if applicable). The faculty member may not be the publisher, producer, or agent.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/system/files/media/spsf_form_0.docx\">SPSF application</a></p>\n<p><strong>4. Open Access Policy</strong></p>\n<p>The faculty members of Middlebury College are committed to broad dissemination of their research and scholarship. Therefore, faculty members grant Middlebury College permission to exercise the copyright in their scholarly articles in order to make those articles freely available. More specifically, each faculty member grants to Middlebury College a nonexclusive, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to each of their scholarly articles, in any medium, provided that the articles are not sold for a profit, and to authorize others to do the same. Middlebury will grant these rights in turn to the authors themselves, so faculty authors may exercise the same rights. This applies to all scholarly articles authored or co-authored by Middlebury faculty. It does not apply to articles completed before the adoption of this policy, or to articles already under an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement at the time this policy was adopted (May 2016). The granting of this license will have no effect on the copyright ownership of the faculty articles, which remains with the faculty member unless they assign them to another party. This license is revocable at will for individual articles using the process described below.</p>\n<p>If directed by a faculty member, the Dean of the Faculty’s Office will automatically waive application of the license for particular articles or delay access for a specified period of time. Faculty members may request waivers at any time. A decision to obtain a waiver or failure to submit an article will have no bearing in annual or other reviews of faculty.</p>\n<p>Faculty will provide the author’s final version of each article to the Dean of the Faculty’s Office. Unless the faculty member has obtained a waiver, the Dean of the Faculty’s Office will make the article available to the public in an open-access repository. Otherwise, the article will be stored in the repository for archival purposes.</p>\n<p><em>rev. 7/19/16</em></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2021","slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/faculty/reprints-subventions","title":"C.12.
