After a two-week elimination period STD pays 60% of pre-disability wages* for up to 26 weeks. Full details on the benefit can be found in the Middlebury Health and Welfare Summary Plan Description (available on-line or from the Human Resources Office).</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term Disability Pay</strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury provides a fully-insured, employer-paid long-term disability (LTD) benefit which is available to faculty members unable to work for an extended period of time. LTD provides income replacement of 60% of pre-disability wages* during a qualifying and approved disability (see the Middlebury College Health and Welfare Benefit Plan Summary Plan Description or contact Human Resources for details about this plan).</p>\n<p>*<em>In order to receive disability pay a faculty member <strong>must</strong> file a disability application (available from the Human Resources Department) in a timely manner; failure to do so will result in a delay or even loss of eligibility for income replacement benefits.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Supplementing Disability Pay using Faculty Leave Reserve</strong></p>\n<p>Faculty may arrange to use accrued Faculty Leave Reserve to augment the 60% short-term or long-term disability income replacement benefit as well as during the elimination period for STD, thus remaining at full salary. Arrangements to do so can be made through the Disability/Leave Specialist in the Human Resources Department.</p>\n<p><strong>Timetable of Disability Pay, Benefits, and Status</strong></p>\n<p>Many factors, such as a faculty member’s length of service, current benefit elections, full or partial disability status, etc. can affect the timeline of pay, benefits, and faculty status during a period of disability. The VPAA/DoF and Human Resources work together to communicate specific timeline information to faculty members unable to work due to a medical condition. The chart below illustrates the most straight-forward scenario: it assumes a faculty member with multiple years of service, tenure/tenure track status, current enrollment in employee benefits and full (not partial) disability.</p>\n<p><strong>Sample Disability Timeline (Tenure or Tenure Track Faculty Only)</strong></p>\n<table style=\"width:0px\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"94\" valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>Time</strong></p>\n<p><em>(from onset of disability)</em></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"96\" valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>Faculty Status</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"157\" valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>Pay</strong></p>\n<p><em>(level and source)</em></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"156\" valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>Benefits Eligibility</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"114\" valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>FMLA Coverage</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"94\">\n<p>0-3 months</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"96\">\n<p>Active, on medical leave</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"157\">\n<p>100% of salary:</p>\n<p><em>Short-Term Disability pays 60% of weeks 3-12, use accrued Faculty Leave Reserve to bring to 100% of pay for full period of disability</em></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"156\">\n<p>Regular employee benefits continue</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"114\">\n<p>FMLA period</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"94\">\n<p>3-6 months</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"96\">\n<p>Active, on medical leave</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"157\">\n<p>100% of salary:</p>\n<p><em>Short-Term Disability pays 60% throughout, use accrued Faculty Leave Reserve to bring to 100% of pay</em></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"156\">\n<p>Regular employee benefits continue</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"114\">\n<p>FMLA ends when individual has been absent from work for 12 weeks</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"94\">\n<p>6-12 months</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"96\">\n<p>Active, on medical leave</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"157\">\n<p>60% of salary paid by LTD; up to 40% covered by accrued Faculty Leave Reserve</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"156\">\n<p>Regular employee benefits continue</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"114\">\n<p>Not available</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"94\">\n<p>12-24</p>\n<p>months</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"96\">\n<p>Temporary Inactive status, on medical leave</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"157\">\n<p>60% of pre-disability wages paid by LTD.  Use available accrued Faculty Leave Reserve for up to 40% of pay.</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"156\">\n<p>Continuation of Medical,  Dental &#x26; Vision benefits; no longer considered “actively employed” under LTD and Life insurance policies.
