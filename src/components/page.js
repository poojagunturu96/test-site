          Through a commitment to immersive learning, we prepare students to
          lead engaged, consequential, and creative lives, contribute to their
          communities, and address the world’s most challenging problems.

      </p>
      <h2>Introduction to Middlebury's Handbook</h2>
      <p>
        This 2019-2020 Handbook supersedes previous editions of the College,
        Institute, and Language Schools Handbooks as of its online publication
        date. Section I applies to all students, faculty and staff of Middlebury
        programs, while other sections may apply only to specific populations,
        such as students in a particular program. Middlebury ensures compliance
        with local laws throughout its programs, in the United States and
        abroad, while setting common expectations for the behavior of all
        members of Middlebury programs to advance Middlebury's educational
        mission. Practical considerations of style and a desire to present
        information to the Middlebury community in a useful, efficient manner
        dictate that this Handbook focus on the more general principles that
        govern our relationships to each other, rather than articulating
        multiple procedures and variances in implementation that ensure
        compliance with local laws.{" "}

      <h2>Academic Freedom, Integrity, and Respect</h2>
      <p>
        Middlebury’s educational mission is supported by three pillars: the
        right of academic freedom, the responsibility of personal and
        professional integrity, and the value of respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          <u>Academic freedom</u>
        </em>{" "}
        is vital to the pursuit of knowledge. In seeking truth and understanding
        in a complex world, scholars must have the ability to ask any question,
        test any hypothesis, consider any line of reasoning, and critically
        assess any assumption. Middlebury therefore recognizes that members of
        its community have the essential right to freely speak, hear, write,
        challenge, and argue, and to pursue questions of their choice using
        methods, sources and approaches of their choice. Middlebury accepts an
        institutional obligation to resolutely defend and protect this right for
        all members of its communities, even when doing so admits inquiry and
        speech that some may find offensive. While this right is broad, it is
        not without limit. The Handbook defines and describes specific
        circumstances in which unfettered freedom would infringe on the rights
        of others or impede Middlebury’s educational mission and operations.
        These sections delineate policies prohibiting disruption of Middlebury’s
        educational functions, define Middlebury’s general conduct standards and
        anti-harassment and discrimination policies, and address the rights and
        obligations of faculty in establishing the parameters of courses. Such
        policies are intended to protect Middlebury’s academic mission and the
        personal rights of all members of its community, not to inhibit academic
        inquiry and expression
      </p>
      <p>
        With the right of academic freedom comes the responsibility of{" "}
        <em>
          <i>integrity</i>
        </em>
        , which is a key guard against false information and the abuse of power.
        Personal and professional integrity have many components that extend
        beyond the specifics of Middlebury’s honor code, and they encompass a
        broader ethical practice of inquiry pursued with rigor and honesty.
        Professional integrity requires recognition of the expertise of past and
        current communities of scholars and students, and necessitates critical
        evaluation of this received knowledge. It also demands honest and
        transparent reporting of research, observation, and experimental
        evidence, consistent with the respective standards of our disciplines.
        On a personal level, integrity calls for recognition of the limits of
        one’s own knowledge and expertise at any moment in time, and demands
        curiosity and creativity in the face of those limits. It also means the
        willingness to take a principled stand even when it is unpopular, and
        equal willingness to admit error. Correspondingly, given that
        interpretations and arguments are contestable, having integrity means
        acknowledging alternative understandings as well as allowing others to
        examine them. Above all, integrity requires awareness of the ways in
        which personal and institutional power can threaten academic freedom and
        a commitment to protect it equally and for all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Academic freedom and integrity are necessary but not sufficient to
        pursue knowledge and critical engagement with the wider world.
        Engagement with the ideas and experiences of others are also key guards
        against our own individual limitations and biases. We, as members of
        this academic community, therefore recognize the fundamental principle
        of{" "}
        <em>
          <u>mutual respect</u>
        </em>
        . We aspire to demonstrate intellectual range and emotional generosity
        by opening ourselves to different perspectives. As an institution,
        Middlebury is committed to creating an atmosphere in which all of its
        members live and work free from discrimination and harassment. Its
        defense of academic freedom must be waged in conjunction with the
        principle of civil discourse. While disagreement is inevitable and
        acceptable in a free and diverse community, we strive, on both
        individual and institutional levels, to cultivate respect and
        responsibility for self, others, and our shared environment.
