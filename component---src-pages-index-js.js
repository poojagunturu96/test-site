Middlebury ensures compliance with local laws throughout its programs, in the United States and abroad, while setting common expectations for the behavior of all members of Middlebury programs to advance Middlebury's educational mission.

In seeking truth and understanding in a complex world, scholars must have the ability to ask any question, test any hypothesis, consider any line of reasoning, and critically assess any assumption. Middlebury therefore recognizes that members of its community have the essential right to freely speak, hear, write, challenge, and argue, and to pursue questions of their choice using methods, sources and approaches of their choice. Middlebury accepts an institutional obligation to resolutely defend and protect this right for all members of its communities, even when doing so admits inquiry and speech that some may find offensive. While this right is broad, it is not without limit. The Handbook defines and describes specific circumstances in which unfettered freedom would infringe on the rights of others or impede Middlebury’s educational mission and operations. These sections delineate policies prohibiting disruption of Middlebury’s educational functions, define Middlebury’s general conduct standards and anti-harassment and discrimination policies, and address the rights and obligations of faculty in establishing the parameters of courses. Such policies are intended to protect Middlebury’s academic mission and the personal rights of all members of its community, not to inhibit academic inquiry and expression"),i.createElement("p",null,"With the right of academic freedom comes the responsibility of"," ",i.createElement("em",null,i.createElement("i",null,"integrity")),", which is a key guard against false information and the abuse of power. Personal and professional integrity have many components that extend beyond the specifics of Middlebury’s honor code, and they encompass a broader ethical practice of inquiry pursued with rigor and honesty. Professional integrity requires recognition of the expertise of past and current communities of scholars and students, and necessitates critical evaluation of this received knowledge. It also demands honest and transparent reporting of research, observation, and experimental evidence, consistent with the respective standards of our disciplines. On a personal level, integrity calls for recognition of the limits of one’s own knowledge and expertise at any moment in time, and demands curiosity and creativity in the face of those limits. It also means the willingness to take a principled stand even when it is unpopular, and equal willingness to admit error. Correspondingly, given that interpretations and arguments are contestable, having integrity means acknowledging alternative understandings as well as allowing others to examine them. Above all, integrity requires awareness of the ways in which personal and institutional power can threaten academic freedom and a commitment to protect it equally and for all."),i.createElement("p",null,"Academic freedom and integrity are necessary but not sufficient to pursue knowledge and critical engagement with the wider world.
